The United States dropped the bombs after obtaining the consent of the United Kingdom, as required by the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people, most of whom were civilians. They remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare.\nIn the final year of the war, the Allies prepared for what was anticipated to be a bloody invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945. As the Allies turned their full attention to the war in the Pacific War, the Japanese faced the same fate. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". The Japanese ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\nBy August 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bomb, and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. Orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities were issued on July 25. On August 6, one of its B-29s dropped a Little Boy uranium gun-type bomb on Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a Fat Man plutonium implosion-type bomb was dropped by another B-29 on Nagasaki. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed 90,000\u2013146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000\u201380,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition, for many months afterward. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\nJapan announced its surrender to the Allies on August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war. On September 2, the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender, effectively ending World War II. The ethical and legal justification for the bombings is still debated to this day.\nIn 1945, the Pacific War between the Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year. Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25\u00a0million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive. America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.[1]\nIn the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines,[2] recaptured Burma,[3] and invaded Borneo.[4] Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines.[5] In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.[1] Although some Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April\u2013June 1945, 94% were killed;[6] 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedented large number.[7]\nAs the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross tons in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the middle of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.[8]\nEven before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan.[9] The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Ky\u016bsh\u016b.[10] Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kant\u014d Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honsh\u016b by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.[11]\nJapan's geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsug\u014d, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations.[12] Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan,[13] and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions.[14] In all, there were 2.3\u00a0million Japanese Army troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a civilian militia of 28\u00a0million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi, predicted up to 20\u00a0million Japanese deaths.[15]\nA study from June 15, 1945, by the Joint War Plans Committee,[16] who provided planning information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Olympic would result in between 130,000 and 220,000 U.S. casualties, of which U.S. dead would be in the range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army George Marshall, and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.[17]\nThe Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through Ultra intelligence.[18] Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by Michael E. DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4\u00a0million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.[19][20]\nMarshall began contemplating the use of a weapon that was \"readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in American lives\":[21] poison gas. Quantities of phosgene, mustard gas, tear gas and cyanogen chloride were moved to Luzon from stockpiles in Australia and New Guinea in preparation for Operation Olympic, and MacArthur ensured that Chemical Warfare Service units were trained in their use.[21] Consideration was also given to using biological weapons against Japan.[22]\nWhile the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat.[23] Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan.[24] This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.[25]\nBrigadier General Haywood S. Hansell determined that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands would better serve as B-29 bases, but they were in Japanese hands.[26] Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war,[27] and the islands were captured between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed,[28] and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944.[29] These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships.[30] The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944.[31] The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results.[32] These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.[33][34]\nHansell's successor, Major General Curtis LeMay, assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes.[38] Under pressure from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed tactics and decided that low-level incendiary raids against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to area bombardment with incendiaries.[39] Like most strategic bombing during World War II, the aim of the air offensive against Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.[40][41]\nOver the next six months, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay firebombed 67 Japanese cities. The firebombing of Tokyo, codenamed Operation Meetinghouse, on March 9\u201310 killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed 16 square miles (41\u00a0km2) of the city and 267,000 buildings in a single night. It was the deadliest bombing raid of the war, at a cost of 20 B-29s shot down by flak and fighters.[42] By May, 75% of bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down Japan's \"paper cities\". By mid-June, Japan's six largest cities had been devastated.[43] The end of the fighting on Okinawa that month provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland, allowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated. Aircraft flying from Allied aircraft carriers and the Ryukyu Islands also regularly struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall.[44] Firebombing switched to smaller cities, with populations ranging from 60,000 to 350,000. According to Yuki Tanaka, the U.S. fire-bombed over a hundred Japanese towns and cities.[45] These raids were devastating.[46]\nThe Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks and the country's civil defense preparations proved inadequate. Japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns had difficulty engaging bombers flying at high altitude.[47] From April 1945, the Japanese interceptors also had to face American fighter escorts based on Iwo Jima and Okinawa.[48] That month, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service stopped attempting to intercept the air raids in order to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion.[49] By mid-1945 the Japanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country, in order to conserve supplies of fuel.[50] In July 1945, the Japanese had 1,156,000 US barrels (137,800,000\u00a0l) of avgas stockpiled for the invasion of Japan. About 604,000 US barrels (72,000,000\u00a0l) had been consumed in the home islands area in April, May and June 1945.[51] While the Japanese military decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the Allied air raids.[52]\nThe discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility.[53] Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.[54] Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5 to 10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 were needed for a bomb instead of tons of natural uranium and a neutron moderator like heavy water.[55]\nThe 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the nuclear weapons projects of the United Kingdom and Canada, Tube Alloys and the Montreal Laboratory, with the Manhattan Project,[56][57] under the direction of Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.[58] Groves appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer to organize and head the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where bomb design work was carried out.[59] Two types of bombs were eventually developed, both named by Robert Serber. Little Boy was a gun-type fission weapon that used uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium separated at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.[60] The other, known as a Fat Man device, was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, implosion-type nuclear weapon that used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington.[61]\nThere was a Japanese nuclear weapon program, but it lacked the human, mineral and financial resources of the Manhattan Project, and never made much progress towards developing an atomic bomb.[62]\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets.[63] Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan. Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a \"composite\" rather than a \"bombardment\" unit.[64] Working with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over Great Bend, Kansas, and Mountain Home, Idaho, because of its remoteness.[65] Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs and Tibbets declared his group combat-ready.[66]\nThe 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta,[67] known as the 1st Technical Detachment.[68] The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.[69]\nThe ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of embarkation at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22.[70] There were also two representatives from Washington, D.C., Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, the deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee,[71] who were on hand to decide higher policy matters on the spot. Along with Captain William S. Parsons, the commander of Project Alberta, they became known as the \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\".[72]\nIn April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, Colonel William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and David M. Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R. Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on May 10, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on May 28, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C. Tolman.[73]\nThe Target Committee nominated five targets: Kokura, the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; Yokohama, an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; Niigata, a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and Kyoto, a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:\nThese cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids and the Army Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the damage caused by the atomic bombs could be made. Hiroshima was described as \"an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target.\"[74]\nThe Target Committee stated that \"It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1) obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released. ... Kyoto has the advantage of the people being more highly intelligent and hence better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon. Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size and with possible focussing from nearby mountains that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed. The Emperor's palace in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value.\"[74]\nEdwin O. Reischauer, a Japan expert for the U.S. Army Intelligence Service, was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of Kyoto.[74] In his autobiography, Reischauer specifically refuted this claim:\n...\u00a0the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier.[75][76]\nOn May 30, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list due to its historical, religious and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance.[77] Stimson then approached President Harry S. Truman about the matter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the target list.[78] Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July, but Stimson remained adamant.[79][80] On July 25, Nagasaki was put on the target list in place of Kyoto. It was a major military port, one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers, and an important producer of naval ordnance.[80]\nIn early May 1945, the Interim Committee was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear energy.[81] During the meetings on May 31 and June 1, scientist Ernest Lawrence had suggested giving the Japanese a non-combat demonstration.[82] Arthur Compton later recalled that:\nIt was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war.[83]\nThe possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the Franck Report issued by physicist James Franck on June 11 and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that \"we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.\" Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.[84]\nLike Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would be available at the start of August, although more were in production, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.[85][86]\nFor several months, the U.S. had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63\u00c2\u00a0million leaflets across Japan. Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97% destroyed. LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities. Even with the warnings, Japanese opposition to the war remained ineffective. In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities. The leaflets caused such concern that the government ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet.[87][88] Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice \"to appeal to their compatriots\".[89]\nIn preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and also because of the wish to maximize shock in the leadership.[90] No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped.[91] Various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. Robert Jay Lifton wrote that it was July 27,[91] and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 30.[90] The USAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30.[88] Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped.[91] Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese \"...we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked...\"[87] Hiroshima was not listed.[92][93]\nUnder the Quebec Agreement with the United Kingdom, nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. Stimson therefore had to obtain British permission. A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee was held at the Pentagon on July 4, 1945.[94] Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.[94][95][96] As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference, as this also required British concurrence.[94]\nOrders for the attack were issued to General Carl Spaatz on July 25 under the signature of General Thomas T. Handy, the acting Chief of Staff, since Marshall was at the Potsdam Conference with Truman.[97] It read:\nThat day, Truman noted in his diary that:\nThis weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August\u00c2\u00a010th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one.[99]\nThe July 16 success of the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert exceeded expectations.[100] On July 26, Allied leaders issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration was presented as an ultimatum and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in \"the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland\". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqu\u00e9.[101]\nOn July 28, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, Prime Minister Suzuki Kantar\u014d declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (yakinaoshi) of the Cairo Declaration and that the government intended to ignore it (mokusatsu, \"kill by silence\").[102] The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.[103] Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.[104]\nAt Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from Winston Churchill that Britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal to Wilson.[105]\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945.[106] There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert. The projectile was completed on June 15, and the target insert on July 24.[107] The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on July 16 aboard the cruiser USS\u00c2\u00a0Indianapolis, and arrived on Tinian on July 26.[108] The target insert followed by air on July 30, accompanied by Commander Francis Birch from Project Alberta.[107] Responding to concerns expressed by the 509th Composite Group about the possibility of a B-29 crashing on takeoff, Birch had modified the Little Boy design to incorporate a removable breech plug that would permit the bomb to be armed in flight.[106]\nThe first plutonium core, along with its polonium-beryllium urchin initiator, was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper.[109] The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.[110]\nAt the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both industrial and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan,[111] and was located in Hiroshima Castle. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated.[112] Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit.[113] The city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.[114]\nHiroshima was a supply and logistics base for the Japanese military.[115] The city was a communications center, a key port for shipping, and an assembly area for troops.[77] It was a beehive of war industry, manufacturing parts for planes and boats, for bombs, rifles, and handguns.[116] The center of the city contained several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.[117] It was the second largest city in Japan after Kyoto that was still undamaged by air raids,[118] primarily because it lacked the aircraft manufacturing industry that was the XXI Bomber Command's priority target. On July 3, the Joint Chiefs of Staff placed it off limits to bombers, along with Kokura, Niigata and Kyoto.[119]\nThe population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At the time of the attack, the population was approximately 340,000\u2013350,000.[120] Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing.[121] Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima.[122] More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks.[123] These continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.[124]\nHiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, named after Tibbets' mother and piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan. Enola Gay was accompanied by two other B-29s. The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, which carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, which served as the photography aircraft.[125]\nAfter leaving Tinian the aircraft made their way separately to Iwo Jima to rendezvous with Sweeney and Marquardt at 05:55 at 9,200 feet (2,800\u00a0m),[127] and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at 31,060 feet (9,470\u00a0m).[128] Parsons, who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb in flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. He had witnessed four B-29s crash and burn at takeoff, and feared that a nuclear explosion would occur if a B-29 crashed with an armed Little Boy on board.[129] His assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.[130]\nDuring the night of August 5\u20136, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of numerous American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for Maebashi, 261 en route to Nishinomiya, 111 headed for Ube and 66 bound for Imabari. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. The all-clear was sounded in Hiroshima at 00:05.[132] About an hour before the bombing, the air raid alert was sounded again, as Straight Flush flew over the city. It broadcast a short message which was picked up by Enola Gay. It read: \"Cloud cover less than 3/10th at all altitudes. Advice: bomb primary.\"[133] The all-clear was sounded over Hiroshima again at 07:09.[134]\nAt 08:09, Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier, Major Thomas Ferebee.[135] The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy containing about 64\u00a0kg (141\u00a0lb) of uranium-235 took 44.4 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at about 31,000 feet (9,400\u00a0m) to a detonation height of about 1,900 feet (580\u00a0m) above the city.[136][137] Enola Gay traveled 11.5\u00a0mi (18.5\u00a0km) before it felt the shock waves from the blast.[138]\nDue to crosswind, the bomb missed the aiming point, the Aioi Bridge, by approximately 800\u00a0ft (240\u00a0m) and detonated directly over Shima Surgical Clinic.[139] It released the equivalent energy of 16 kilotons of TNT (67\u00a0TJ), \u00b1 2\u00a0kt.[136] The weapon was considered very inefficient, with only 1.7% of its material fissioning.[140] The radius of total destruction was about 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km), with resulting fires across 4.4 square miles (11\u00a0km2).[141]\nEnola Gay stayed over the target area for two minutes and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew of the nature of the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a blinding flash and given black goggles. \"It was hard to believe what we saw\", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said \"the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'\". He and Tibbets compared the shockwave to \"a close burst of ack-ack fire\".[142]\nPeople on the ground reported seeing a pika (\u30d4\u30ab)\u2014a brilliant flash of light\u2014followed by a don (\u30c9\u30f3)\u2014a loud booming sound.[143] Some 70,000\u201380,000 people, or around 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm,[144][145] and another 70,000 were injured.[146] Perhaps as many as 20,000 Japanese military personnel were killed.[147] U.S. surveys estimated that 4.7 square miles (12\u00a0km2) of the city were destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6\u20137% damaged.[148]\nSome of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima had been very strongly constructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did not collapse even though they were fairly close to the blast center. Since the bomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways, which was largely responsible for the survival of the Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall, now commonly known as the Genbaku (A-bomb) dome. This building was designed and built by the Czech architect Jan Letzel, and was only 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft) from ground zero. The ruin was named Hiroshima Peace Memorial and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 over the objections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the grounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss of life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective.[149] The bombing started fires that spread rapidly through timber and paper homes. As in other Japanese cities, the firebreaks proved ineffective.[150] The intense fires started gutted everything in a 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) radius.[151]\nThe air raid warning had been cleared at 07:31, and many people were outside, going about their activities.[152] Eiz\u014d Nomura was the closest known survivor, being in the basement of a reinforced concrete building (it remained as the Rest House after the war) only 170 metres (560\u00a0ft) from ground zero (the hypocenter) at the time of the attack.[153][154] He died in 1982, aged 84.[155] Akiko Takakura was among the closest survivors to the hypocenter of the blast. She was in the solidly built Bank of Hiroshima only 300 meters (980\u00a0ft) from ground-zero at the time of the attack.[156]\nOver 90% of the doctors and 93% of the nurses in Hiroshima were killed or injured\u2014most had been in the downtown area which received the greatest damage.[160] The hospitals were destroyed or heavily damaged. Only one doctor, Terufumi Sasaki, remained on duty at the Red Cross Hospital.[150] Nonetheless, by early afternoon, the police and volunteers had established evacuation centres at hospitals, schools and tram stations, and a morgue was established in the Asano library.[161]\nMost elements of the Japanese Second General Army headquarters were at physical training on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle, barely 900 yards (820\u00a0m) from the hypocenter. The attack killed 3,243 troops on the parade ground.[162] The communications room of Chugoku Military District Headquarters that was responsible for issuing and lifting air raid warnings was in a semi-basement in the castle. Yoshie Oka, a Hijiyama Girls High School student who had been mobilized to serve as a communications officer had just sent a message that the alarm had been issued for Hiroshima and neighboring Yamaguchi, when the bomb exploded. She used a special phone to inform Fukuyama Headquarters (some 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) away) that \"Hiroshima has been attacked by a new type of bomb. The city is in a state of near-total destruction.\"[163]\nSince Mayor Senkichi Awaya had been killed while eating breakfast with his son and granddaughter at the mayoral residence, Field Marshal Hata, who was only slightly wounded, took over the administration of the city, and coordinated relief efforts. Many of his staff had been killed or fatally wounded, including a Korean prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Wu, who was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army.[164][165] Hata's senior surviving staff officer was the wounded Colonel Kumao Imoto, who acted as his chief of staff. Soldiers from the undamaged Hiroshima Ujina Harbor used suicide boats, intended to repel the American invasion, to collect the wounded and take them down the rivers to the military hospital at Ujina.[164] Trucks and trains brought in relief supplies and evacuated survivors from the city.[166]\nTwelve American airmen were imprisoned at the Chugoku Military Police Headquarters, about 1,300 feet (400\u00a0m) from the hypocenter of the blast.[167] Most died instantly, although two were reported to have been executed by their captors, and two prisoners badly injured by the bombing were left next to the Aioi Bridge by the Kempei Tai, where they were stoned to death.[168][169] Eight U.S. prisoners of war killed as part of the medical experiments program at Kyushu University were falsely reported by Japanese authorities as having been killed in the atomic blast as part of an attempted cover up.[170]\nThe Tokyo control operator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air. He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed.[171] About 20 minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima. From some small railway stops within 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima. All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff.[172]\nMilitary bases repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.[172]\nThe staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest. After flying for about three hours, while still nearly 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud of smoke from the bomb. After circling the city in order to survey the damage they landed south of the city, where the staff officer, after reporting to Tokyo, began to organize relief measures. Tokyo's first indication that the city had been destroyed by a new type of bomb came from President Truman's announcement of the strike, sixteen hours later.[172]\nAfter the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon. He stated, \"We may be grateful to Providence\" that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had \"spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history\u2014and won\". Truman then warned Japan: \"If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.\"[173] This was a widely broadcast speech picked up by Japanese news agencies.[174]\nThe 50,000-watt standard wave station on Saipan, the OWI radio station, broadcast a similar message to Japan every 15 minutes about Hiroshima, stating that more Japanese cities would face a similar fate in the absence of immediate acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and emphatically urged civilians to evacuate major cities. Radio Japan, which continued to extoll victory for Japan by never surrendering,[87] had informed the Japanese of the destruction of Hiroshima by a single bomb.[177] Prime Minister Suzuki felt compelled to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on.[178]\nSoviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral abrogation of the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact on August 5. At two minutes past midnight on August 9, Tokyo time, Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation.[179] Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior leadership of the Japanese Army began preparations to impose martial law on the nation, with the support of Minister of War Korechika Anami, in order to stop anyone attempting to make peace.[180]\nOn August 7, a day after Hiroshima was destroyed, Dr. Yoshio Nishina and other atomic physicists arrived at the city, and carefully examined the damage. They then went back to Tokyo and told the cabinet that Hiroshima was indeed destroyed by an atomic bomb. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied, so they decided to endure the remaining attacks, acknowledging \"there would be more destruction but the war would go on\".[181] American Magic codebreakers intercepted the cabinet's messages.[182]\nPurnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam that same day to discuss what should be done next.[183] Since there was no indication of Japan surrendering,[182] they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.[184][183]\nThe city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry.[185] Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.[119]\nUnlike the other target cities, Nagasaki had not been placed off limits to bombers by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's July 3 directive,[119][186] and was bombed on a small scale five times. During one of these raids on August 1, a number of conventional high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. A few hit the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city, and several hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works.[185] By early August, the city was defended by the 134th Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the 4th Anti-Aircraft Division with four batteries of 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries.[114]\nIn contrast to Hiroshima, almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.[187]\nResponsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets. Scheduled for August 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10.[188] Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.[189]\nAt 03:49 on the morning of August 9, 1945, Bockscar, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.[191]\nDuring pre-flight inspection of Bockscar, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640 US gallons (2,400\u00a0l; 530\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.[192][193]\nThis time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as observers on the third plane, Big Stink, flown by the group's operations officer, Major James I. Hopkins, Jr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, Big Stink failed to make the rendezvous.[191] According to Cheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including 9,000 feet (2,700\u00a0m) higher than he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over Yakushima as previously agreed with Sweeney and Captain Frederick C. Bock, who was piloting the support B-29 The Great Artiste. Instead, Hopkins was flying 40-mile (64\u00a0km) dogleg patterns.[194] Though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes, Sweeney continued to wait for Big Stink for forty minutes. Before leaving the rendezvous point, Sweeney consulted Ashworth, who was in charge of the bomb. As commander of the aircraft, Sweeney made the decision to proceed to the primary, the city of Kokura.[195]\nAfter exceeding the original departure time limit by nearly a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke.[196] The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses around Kokura, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.[197]\nAfter three runs over the city, and with fuel running low because of the failed fuel pump, Bockscar and The Great Artiste headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki.[191] Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would be forced to divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth agreed with Sweeney's suggestion that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.[198][199] At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the \"all clear\" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53, the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.[200]\nA few minutes later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped instruments attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later.[201] In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.[202]\nAt 11:01, a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed Bockscar's bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, to visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core of about 5\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb) of plutonium, was dropped over the city's industrial valley. It exploded 47 seconds later at 1,650\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033\u00a0ft (503\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0m), above a tennis court,[203] halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Nagasaki Arsenal in the north. This was nearly 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the Urakami Valley and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills.[204] The resulting explosion released the equivalent energy of 21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0kt (87.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4\u00a0TJ).[136] Big Stink spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away, and flew over to observe.[205]\nBockscar flew on to Okinawa, arriving with only sufficient fuel for a single approach. Sweeney tried repeatedly to contact the control tower for landing clearance, but received no answer. He could see heavy air traffic landing and taking off from Yontan Airfield. Firing off every flare on board to alert the field to his emergency landing, the Bockscar came in fast, landing at 140 miles per hour (230\u00a0km/h) instead of the normal 120 miles per hour (190\u00a0km/h). The number two engine died from fuel starvation as he began the final approach. Touching down midway down the landing strip, Bockscar bounced up into the air again for about 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m) before slamming back down hard. The heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. Its reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, Bockscar made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion before the plane came to a stop. The flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total remained.[206]\nFollowing the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the plane. The first eyewitness account by war correspondent William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who accompanied the mission aboard the aircraft piloted by Bock, reported that Sweeney was leading the mission in The Great Artiste. He also noted its \"Victor\" number as 77, which was that of Bockscar.[207] Laurence had interviewed Sweeney and his crew, and was aware that they referred to their airplane as The Great Artiste. Except for Enola Gay, none of the 393d's B-29s had yet had names painted on the noses, a fact which Laurence himself noted in his account. Unaware of the switch in aircraft, Laurence assumed Victor 77 was The Great Artiste,[208] which was in fact, Victor 89.[209]\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, the effect was confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley.[211] Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed. Some 17,000\u201322,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well.[212] Casualty estimates for immediate deaths vary widely, ranging from 22,000 to 75,000.[212] At least 35,000\u201340,000 people were killed and 60,000 others injured.[213][214] In the days and months following the explosion, more people died from their injuries. Because of the presence of undocumented foreign workers, and a number of military personnel in transit, there are great discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945; a range of 39,000 to 80,000 can be found in various studies.[120]\nUnlike Hiroshima's military death toll, only 150 Japanese soldiers were killed instantly, including thirty-six from the 134th AAA Regiment of the 4th AAA Division.[114] At least eight known POWs died from the bombing and as many as 13 may have died, including a British prisoner of war, Royal Air Force Corporal Ronald Shaw,[215] and seven Dutch POWs.[216] One American POW, Joe Kieyoomia, was in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.[217] There were 24 Australian POWs in Nagasaki, all of whom survived.[218]\nThe radius of total destruction was about 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km), followed by fires across the northern portion of the city to 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) south of the bomb.[141][221] About 58% of the Mitsubishi Arms Plant was damaged, and about 78% of the Mitsubishi Steel Works. The Mitsubishi Electric Works suffered only 10% structural damage as it was on the border of the main destruction zone. The Nagasaki Arsenal was destroyed in the blast.[222] Although many fires likewise burnt following the bombing, in contrast to Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon. Instead, the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the valley.[223]\nAs in Hiroshima, the bombing badly dislocated the city's medical facilities. A makeshift hospital was established at the Shinkozen Primary School, which served as the main medical centre. The trains were still running, and evacuated many victims to hospitals in nearby towns. A medical team from a naval hospital reached the city in the evening, and fire-fighting brigades from the neighboring towns assisted in fighting the fires.[224] Takashi Nagai was a doctor working in the radiology department of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital. He received a serious injury that severed his right temporal artery, but joined the rest of the surviving medical staff in treating bombing victims.[225]\nGroves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October.[86] On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that \"the next bomb\u00a0... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August.\" Marshall endorsed the memo with the hand-written comment, \"It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President\",[86] something Truman had requested that day. This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs \"as made ready\".[226] There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall, and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs.[227]\nTwo more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14,[228] and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay to return to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them.[229] At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core.[230] Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16.[231] Therefore, it could have been ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.[226]\nUntil August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender. The full cabinet met on 14:30 on August 9, and spent most of the day debating surrender. Anami conceded that victory was unlikely, but argued in favour of continuing the war nonetheless. The meeting ended at 17:30, with no decision having been reached. Suzuki went to the palace to report on the outcome of meeting, where he met with K\u014dichi Kido, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan. Kido informed him that the emperor had agreed to hold an imperial conference, and gave a strong indication that the emperor would consent to surrender on condition that kokutai be preserved. A second cabinet meeting was held at 18:00. Only four ministers supported Anami's position of adhering to the four conditions, but since cabinet decisions had to be unanimous, no decision was reached before it ended at 22:00.[232]\nCalling an imperial conference required the signatures of the prime minister and the two service chiefs, but the Chief Cabinet Secretary Hisatsune Sakomizu had already obtained signatures from Toyoda and General Yoshijir\u014d Umezu in advance, and he reneged on his promise to inform them if a meeting was to be held. The meeting commenced at 23:50. No consensus had emerged by 02:00, but the emperor gave his \"scared decision\",[233] authorizing the Foreign Minister, Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d, to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration \"does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler.\"[234]\nOn August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Asaka, then asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied, \"Of course.\"[235] As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his capitulation announcement which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a short rebellion by militarists opposed to the surrender.[236]\nIn his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings, and did not explicitly mention the Soviets as a factor for surrender:\nDespite the best that has been done by every one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the gallant fighting of military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of Our servants of the State and the devoted service of Our one hundred million people, the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\nSuch being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers.[237]\nIn his \"Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors\" delivered on August 17, however, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion on his decision to surrender.[238]\nOn August 10, 1945, the day after the Nagasaki bombing, Y\u014dsuke Yamahata, correspondent Higashi, and artist Yamada arrived in the city with orders to record the destruction for maximum propaganda purposes, Yamahata took scores of photographs, and on August 21, they appeared in Mainichi Shimbun, a popular Japanese newspaper.[239] Wilfred Burchett was the first western journalist to visit Hiroshima after the bombing, arriving alone by train from Tokyo on September 2. His Morse code dispatch, \"The Atomic Plague\", was printed by the Daily Express newspaper in London on September 5, 1945, and was the first public report to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear fallout.[240] His reporting was unpopular with the U.S. military, who accused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda, and suppressed a supporting story submitted by George Weller of the Chicago Daily News. Laurence dismissed the reports on radiation sickness as Japanese efforts to undermine American morale, ignoring his own account published one week earlier.[241]\nA member of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, Lieutenant Daniel McGovern, used a film crew to document the effects of the bombings in early 1946. The film crew shot 90,000\u00a0ft (27,000\u00a0m) of film, resulting in a three-hour documentary titled The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb; it showed burned-out buildings and cars, and rows of skulls and bones on the ground. It was classified \"secret\" for the next 22 years.[242][243]\nMotion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On October 24, 1945, a U.S. military policeman stopped a Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were confiscated by the American authorities, but they were requested by the Japanese government, and declassified.[243] The public release of film footage of the city post-attack, and some research about the effects of the attack, was restricted during the occupation of Japan,[244] but the Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka, in its first issue published on March 10, 1946, devoted itself to detailing the damage from the bombing.[245]\nThe book Hiroshima, written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine The New Yorker,[246] on August 31, 1946, is reported to have reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949.[247][248][249] It narrated the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to, and months after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb.[246] Beginning in 1974, a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977, and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.[250]\nThe bombing amazed Otto Hahn and other German atomic scientists, whom the British held at Farm Hall in Operation Epsilon. Hahn stated that he had not believed an atomic weapon \"would be possible for another twenty years\"; Werner Heisenberg did not believe the news at first. Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker said \"I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part\", but Heisenberg replied, \"One could equally well say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'\". Hahn was grateful that the German project had not succeeded in developing \"such an inhumane weapon\"; Karl Wirtz observed that even if it had, \"we would have obliterated London but would still not have conquered the world, and then they would have dropped them on us\".[251]\nThe Vatican agreed; L'Osservatore Romano expressed regret that the bomb's inventors did not destroy the weapon for the benefit of humanity.[252] Rev. Cuthbert Thicknesse, the Dean of St Albans, prohibited using St Albans Abbey for a thanksgiving service for the war's end, calling the use of atomic weapons \"an act of wholesale, indiscriminate massacre\".[253] Nonetheless, news of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the U.S.; a poll in Fortune magazine in late 1945 showed a significant minority of Americans (22.7%) wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on Japan.[254][255] The initial positive response was supported by the imagery presented to the public (mainly the powerful images of the mushroom cloud).[254] During this time in America, it was a common practice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films, magazines, and newspapers.[256]\nFrequent estimates are that 140,000 people in Hiroshima (38.9% of the population) and 70,000 people in Nagasaki (28.0% of the population) died in 1945, though the number which died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the hypocenter, who suffered injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome(ARS), all within about 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 days.[257][258] The average radiation dose that will kill approximately 50% of adults, the LD50, was approximately halved when the individual experienced concurrent blast or burn effect injuries, conventional skin injuries that cover a large area, frequently result in bacterial infection, the risk of which is increased when a usually non-lethal radiation dose, moderately suppresses the white blood cell count.[259]\nIn the spring of 1948, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) was established in accordance with a presidential directive from Truman to the National Academy of Sciences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c National Research Council to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[260]\nAs cancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation instead radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality, could be due to radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those who took part in the study.[261]\nWhile during the preimplantation period, that is 1-10 days following conception, interuterine radiation exposure of \"at least 0.2 Gy\" can cause complications of implantation and death of the embryo.[262] The number of miscarriages caused by the radiation from the bombings, during this radiosensitive period, is not known.\nOne of the early studies conducted by the ABCC was on the outcome of pregnancies occurring in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in a control city, Kure, located 18\u00a0mi (29\u00a0km) south of Hiroshima, in order to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation exposure.[263] James V. Neel led the study which found that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher among the children of survivors who were pregnant at the time of the bombings.[264] He also studied the longevity of the children who survived the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reporting that between 90 and 95 percent were still living 50 years later.[265]\nThe National Academy of Sciences questioned Neel's procedure which did not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure.[266] Overall, while a statistically insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Neel and others noted that in approximately 50 humans who were of an early gestational age at the time of the bombing and who were all within about 1 kilometre (0.62\u00c2\u00a0mi) from the hypocenter, an increase in microencephaly and anencephaly was observed upon birth, with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what was to be expected when compared to the control group in Kure, were approximately 20 cases were observed in a similar sample size.[267]\nIn 1985, Johns Hopkins University geneticist James F. Crow examined Neel's research and confirmed that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[268] Many members of the ABCC and its successor Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) were still looking for possible birth defects or other causes among the survivors decades later, but found no evidence that they were more common among the survivors.[265][269]\nDespite the small sample size of 1600 to 1800 persons who came forth as prenatally exposed at the time of the bombings, that were both within a close proximity to the two hypocenters, to survive the In utero absorbtion of a substantial dose of radiation and then the malnourished post-attack environment, data from this cohort does support the increased risk of severe mental retardation (SMR), that was observed in some 30 individuals, with SMR being a common outcome of the aforementioned microencephaly. While a lack of statistical data, with just 30 individuals out of 1800, prevents a definitive determination of a threshold point, the data collected suggests a threshold interuterine or fetal dose for SMR, at the most radiosensitive period of cognitive development, when there is the largest number of undifferentiated neural cells(8 to 15 weeks post-conception) to begin at a threshold dose of approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy, with the risk then linearly increasing to a 43% rate of SMR when exposed to a fetal dose of 1 Gy at any point during these weeks of rapid Neurogenesis.[270][271]\nHowever either side of this radiosensitive age, none of the prenatally exposed to the bombings at an age less than 8 weeks, that is prior to synaptogenesis or at a gestational age more than 26 weeks \"were observed to be mentally retarded\", with the condition therefore being isolated to those solely of 8-26 weeks of age and who absorbed more than approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy of radiation energy.[272][273]\nExamination of the prenatally exposed in terms of IQ performance and school records, determined the beginning of a statistically significant reduction in both, when exposed to greater than 0.1 to 0.5 Gray, during the same gestational period of 8-25 weeks. However outside this period, at less than 8 weeks and greater than 26 after conception, \"there is no evidence of a radiation-related effect on scholastic performance.\"[274]\nThe reporting of doses in terms of absorbed energy (Gy and rad) rather than the use of the biologically significant, biologically weighted Sievert, in both the SMR and cognitive performance data is typical.[275] The reported threshold dose variance, between the two cities is sometimes explained due to Little Boy emitting substantially more neutron flux, whereas the Baratol that surrounded the core of Fat Man, filtered or shifted the absorbed radiation profile, so that the dose of radiation energy received in Nagasaki, is mostly that from exposure to gamma rays, in contrast to the environment within 1500 meters of the hypocenter at Hiroshima, were instead the dose was primarily due to absorbed neutrons, which have a higher biological effect per unit of energy absorbed.[276]\nMany other investigations into cognitive outcomes, such as Schizophrenia as a result of prenatal exposure, have been conducted with \"no statistically significant linear relationship seen\", there is a suggestion that in the most extremely exposed, those who survived within a kilometer or so of the hypocenters, a trend emerges akin to that seen in SMR, though the sample size is too small to determine with any significance.[277]\nThe survivors of the bombings are called hibakusha (\u88ab\u7206\u8005, Japanese pronunciation:\u00a0[\u00e7ibak\u026f\u0325\u0255a]), a Japanese word that literally translates to \"explosion-affected people\". The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as hibakusha. As of March 31, 2017[update], 164,621 were still alive, mostly in Japan.[278] The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation.[279] The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, as of August 2017[update] the memorials record the names of almost 485,000 hibakusha; 308,725 in Hiroshima[280] and 175,743 in Nagasaki.[281]\nHibakusha and their children were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious.[282] This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[283] A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17\u201320 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.[284]\nPerhaps as many as 200 people from Hiroshima sought refuge in Nagasaki. The 2006 documentary Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki documented 165 nij\u016b hibakusha (lit. double explosion-affected people), nine of whom claimed to be in the blast zone in both cities.[285] On March 24, 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi as a double hibakusha. He was confirmed to be 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before the bombing, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings.[286] He died on January 4, 2010, at the age of 93, after a battle with stomach cancer.[287]\nDuring the war, Japan brought as many as 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor.[288] About 5,000\u20138,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and another 1,500\u20132,000 died in Nagasaki.[289] For many years, Korean survivors had a difficult time fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of the free health benefits to them in Japan. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.[290]\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on September 17, 1945. More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city.[291] The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946.[292] The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949. It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes.[293] In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park.[294] Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-My\u014dh\u014dji.[295]\nNagasaki was also rebuilt after the war, but was dramatically changed in the process. The pace of reconstruction was initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946. The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing. This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949.[292] New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity. Some of the rubble was left as a memorial, such as a torii at Sann\u014d Shrine, and an arch near ground zero. New structures were also raised as memorials, such as the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, which was opened in the mid-1990s.[296]\nThe role of the bombings in Japan's surrender, and the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the United States' justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate.[297] On one hand, it has been argued, that the bombings caused the Japanese surrender, thereby preventing casualties that an invasion of Japan would have involved.[6][298] Stimson talked of saving one million casualties.[299] The naval blockade might have starved the Japanese into submission without an invasion, but this would also have resulted in many more Japanese deaths.[300]\nJapanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa argued that the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan \"played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow's mediation\".[301] A view among critics of the bombings, that was popularized by American historian Gar Alperovitz in 1965, is the idea of atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages of the Cold War. Although not accepted by mainstream historians, this became the position in Japanese school history textbooks.[302]\nThose who oppose the bombings, give other reasons for their view; among them: a belief, that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral, that the bombings counted as war crimes, that they constituted state terrorism,[303] and that they involved racism against and the dehumanization of the Japanese people.[304]\nLike the way it began, the manner in which World War II ended cast a long shadow over international relations for decades to come. By June 30, 1946, there were components for only nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal, all Fat Man devices identical to the one used in the bombing of Nagasaki.[305] The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development.[306] The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy had decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting \"an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\",[307] but in October 1947, he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs.[308]\nThe American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted only four years before the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb in September 1949.[308] The United States responded with the development of the hydrogen bomb, a nuclear weapon a thousand times as powerful as the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[309] Such ordinary fission bombs would henceforth be regarded as small tactical nuclear weapons.[310] By 1986, the United States would have 23,317 nuclear weapons, while the Soviet Union had 40,159. By 2017, nine nations had nuclear weapons,[311] but Japan was not one of them. Japan reluctantly signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in February 1970,[312] but it still sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella. American nuclear weapons were stored on Okinawa, and sometimes in Japan itself, albeit in contravention of agreements between the two nations.[313] Lacking the resources to fight the Soviet Union using conventional forces, the Western Alliance came to depend on the use of nuclear weapons to defend itself during the Cold War, a policy that became known in the 1950s as the New Look.[314] In the decades after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States would threaten to use its nuclear weapons many times.[315]",

        "text": "Las Vegas Stadium is the working name for a domed stadium under construction in Paradise, Nevada for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) and the UNLV Rebels football team from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). It is located on about 62 acres west of Mandalay Bay at Russell Road and Hacienda Avenue and between Polaris Avenue and Dean Martin Drive, just west of Interstate 15. Construction of the $1.9 billion stadium began in September 2017 and is expected to be completed in time for the 2020 NFL season.\nIn January 2016, reports emerged that Las Vegas Sands was considering developing a stadium in conjunction with Majestic Realty and UNLV, on a 42-acre site owned by UNLV.[6] UNLV had been in the market to for a new stadium to replace Sam Boyd Stadium since at least 2011.[7] Raiders owner Mark Davis visited Las Vegas on January 29 to tour the site and meet with Sands chairman Sheldon Adelson and other local figures.[8] The Raiders, who had been trying to get a new, long term stadium built for the team since the 1980s had just missed out on relocating to Los Angeles that same month and were at an impasse in Oakland. In order for the team to relocate to Las Vegas a new stadium was required since Sam Boyd Stadium is undersized for the NFL and there are no other professional-caliber stadiums in Nevada.\nOn March 21, 2016, when asked about Las Vegas, Davis said, \"I think the Raiders like the Las Vegas plan,\" and \"it's a very very very intriguing and exciting plan\", referring to the stadium plan in Las Vegas. Davis also met with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval about the stadium plan. On April 1, 2016, Davis toured Sam Boyd Stadium to evaluate whether UNLV could serve as a temporary home of the team and was with UNLV football coach Tony Sanchez, athletic director Tina Kunzer-Murphy, adviser Don Snyder and school president Len Jessup to further explore the possibility of the Raiders moving to Las Vegas.\nOn April 28, 2016, Davis said he wanted to move the Raiders to Las Vegas and pledged $500\u00a0million toward the construction of the proposed $2.4\u00a0billion domed stadium.[9][10] \"Together we can turn the Silver State into the silver and black state,\" Davis said.[9][11]\nIn the spring of 2016, the board of directors of Las Vegas Sands rejected Adelson's stadium proposal. Adelson decided to move ahead with the stadium as an individual investment, pledging $650 million of his personal wealth to the project.[12]\nThe viability of the Tropicana Avenue site was called into serious question in June 2016, when Southwest Airlines objected to the location because its proximity to the northern end of one of McCarran Airport's runways could have a negative impact on the safety and capacity of air traffic at the airport.[13] The list of potential locations soon expanded to nine candidates, including the sites of the Wild Wild West casino, the Wynn golf course, the Riviera casino, the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, and Cashman Center.[14] By September, the list was narrowed to two possibilities: the Bali Hai Golf Club, south of Mandalay Bay, and a vacant lot on Russell Road, just west of Interstate 15.[15]\nOn August 25, 2016, the Raiders filed a trademark application for \"Las Vegas Raiders\" on the same day renderings of a proposed stadium design were released.[16] On September 15, 2016, the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee unanimously voted to recommend and approve $750\u00c2\u00a0million for the Las Vegas stadium plan.[17]\nMajestic Realty revealed in October 2016 that it had withdrawn from the stadium project.[18]\nSandoval called a special session of the Nevada Legislature to consider the stadium and other tourism-related proposals in October 2016.[19] The funding bill for the stadium was approved by a 16\u20135 vote in the Senate and by 28\u201313 in the Assembly, and was signed into law by Sandoval on October 17.[20][21][22][23] The bill increased a hotel tax to provide the $750 million in funding.[22]\nThe Raiders filed relocation papers on January 19 to move from Oakland to Las Vegas.[24] On January 26, 2017, the Raiders submitted a proposed lease agreement for the stadium. It was reported that the Raiders had selected the Russell Road site as the stadium location, the team would pay one dollar in rent, and that they could control the naming rights for both the stadium and plaza and in addition keep signage sponsorship revenue.[25]\nDays after the Raiders' announced proposal, Adelson dropped out of the stadium project, pulling his proposed $650 million contribution, and shortly after this announcement Goldman Sachs (one of the backers of stadium proposal) withdrew as well.[26] ESPN reported on January 30, 2017, that the Raiders were expected to increase their contribution from $500 million to $1.15 billion.[27]\nOn March 6, the Raiders revealed Bank of America would be replacing the Adelson portion of the funding.[28]\nNFL owners voted to approve the move by a near unanimous margin of 31 to 1 on March 27. Only Stephen M. Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins, voted against the relocation.[29][30][31] The next day, the Raiders and the Las Vegas Stadium Authority began accepting deposits for season tickets for the new stadium.[32] The Raiders announced that they planned to remain in Oakland until the stadium is complete.\nThe Raiders closed the purchase of the land for the stadium at the Russell Road site on May 1. The purchase price was reported at $77.5 million.[33] In a Las Vegas Stadium Authority meeting on May 11, it was announced that in a joint venture Mortenson Construction and McCarthy Construction will be the developers for the stadium. Mortenson Construction previously worked on U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis for the Minnesota Vikings. The stadium authority approved a stadium lease with the Raiders on May 18.[34] The lease is for 30 years with four successive extension options of five years each.[35]\nOn September 18, construction activity began on the stadium site with site preparation.[36] The Raiders officially broke ground for the new stadium on November 13.[37][38] The ceremony featured NFL Commissioner\u00a0Roger Goodell, Raiders owner Mark Davis, his mother Carol Davis, various Raiders legends including Howie Long, Jim Plunkett, Tom Flores, and Ray Guy, Las Vegas and Nevada politicians such as Governor Brian Sandoval, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak and stadium authority head Steve Hill. The event was hosted by George Lopez and included other celebrities like Carlos Santana, longtime Vegas icon Wayne Newton, and Howie D and Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys. There was also a tribute to the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that happened nearby by with Judith Hill and the Las Vegas House of Blues Gospel Choir performing \u2018Rise up\u2019 while 58 beams of light for the 58 people shot and killed lit up.[39]\nIn January, construction crews began blasting caliche rock with dynamite to excavate and create the stadium bowl.[40]\nThe budget for development of the stadium is estimated at $1.9 billion. Of this, an estimated $375 million is to be spent on land and infrastructure costs, $1.35 billion on construction, and $100 million on a Raiders practice facility, with the remaining $100 million as a contingency allowance for unexpected costs.[41][42][43]\nThe financing for the project is expected to come in the form of $750 million in public funding, $500 million from the Raiders, and $650 million lent by Bank of America.[42] The public portion of the funding will come from municipal bonds issued by Clark County, backed by the proceeds of a special tax on hotel rooms in the Las Vegas area, which was initiated in March 2017.[44] The Raiders' contribution is expected to include a $200 million loan from the NFL's stadium upgrade program, $250 million from sales of personal seat licenses at the stadium, and $50 million from cash reserves.[45]\nLocal government cannot receive any rent or revenue sharing from the stadium, because such an arrangement would not be compatible with the tax-exempt status of the bonds.[46] Proponents instead argued that the public financing would be justified by increased economic activity and tax revenue related to the stadium.[47] Critics have argued that the economic projections were based on overly optimistic assumptions.[48][49]\nFor Las Vegas Stadium, Mark Davis retained the same architecture firm, MANICA Architecture, that had designed the previously proposed Carson Stadium near Los Angeles.[50][51] The stadium as proposed is a 10 level domed stadium with a clear ETFE roof, silver and black exterior and large retractable curtain-like side windows facing the Las Vegas Strip.[52] There is a large torch in one end that would house a flame in honor of Al Davis, the late long-time owner of the Raiders.[53]\nUpdated renderings released after the relocation vote passed show the stadium with a roll-in natural grass field similar to the one at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.[54] In an August 17, 2017 Las Vegas Stadium Authority meeting it was revealed that the stadium will have a designated pickup/drop off loop for ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, a first for a stadium in the NFL.\nThe stadium will replace Sam Boyd Stadium and will serve as the home of both the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels football program. In addition, it will host various events now held at Sam Boyd, such as the Las Vegas Bowl.[55]\nStadium backers project 20 to 25 additional events per year, with plausible possibilities including the Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl, the NFL Draft, the NCAA Final Four, the USA Sevens rugby tournament, the Monster Jam World Finals, boxing matches, Ultimate Fighting Championship events, neutral-site college football games, international soccer matches, concerts, and corporate shows.[56][57]\nThe stadium has also been cited as the possible home for a Major League Soccer expansion team owned by David Beckham.[58]",

It also reached number 45 in Australia.\nA 12\" single was also issued and featured an extended dance version and dub version. \"Everywhere\" also marked the first CD single release by the band in most territories.[citation needed] All formats included the B-side \"When I See You Again\", a song taken from the Tango in the Night album; the 12\" format featured an extended mix of \"Everywhere\" and the CD single contained bonus tracks \"Rhiannon\" and \"Say You Love Me\" from Fleetwood Mac's tenth studio album Fleetwood Mac (1975).\nAfter featuring in an advert for UK mobile phone provider 3,[2] \"Everywhere\" re-entered the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 15 in March 2013.

        "text": "Jennifer Tallulah \"Jenny\" Humphrey is one of the characters in both the Gossip Girl and The It Girl series of novels by Cecily von Ziegesar. She is portrayed by Taylor Momsen in the Gossip Girl television adaptation on The CW.[1]\nJennifer Humphrey is the daughter of Rufus Humphrey, an editor of Beat poets who has never been published himself, and Jeanette Humphrey, who ran off with a European aristocrat. She has an older brother, Dan Humphrey, an aspiring writer. Jenny is a student at the Constance Billard School for Girls, a small, elite, all-girls school on the Upper East Side that Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf also attend. In the book series, Jenny is described as a short, well-endowed brunette, but the television show depicts her as tall, skinny and blonde.\nIn the Gossip Girl prequel It Had To Be You, Jenny is noted for having a rather flat chest until she begins taking breast enlargement supplements, which are the cause of her DD cup size.\nJenny is the protagonist of the book series The It Girl, which shows her new life after she gets expelled from Constance Billard and starts at Waverly Academy in upstate New York. In The It Girl, Jenny tries to reinvent herself as a \"popular and sophisticated city girl\" and leave behind the person she was at Constance. When Jenny arrives at Waverly, she finds the students even more attractive, athletic, and intimidating than she had imagined. Jenny then meets her two new exceptionally beautiful and popular roommates: lithe and blonde Southern girl Callie Vernon, and red-headed, green-eyed, sophisticated New Jerseyan Brett Messerschmidt. She quickly learns that she has replaced their old best friend, the extremely attractive and notorious Tinsley Carmichael. Jenny can't help but feel that sleeping in such a lucky bed must rub off.\nJenny Humphrey is introduced in Season 1. A pretty, blonde freshman at Constance Billard,[2] she tries desperately to fit in with Blair's clique, but Blair makes it difficult for her, subjecting Jenny to the rules of high school hierarchy. A possible friendship ends when Blair discovers Nate's lingering feelings for Serena and Jenny's interest in Nate, entailing further cruelty to Jenny. When Blair's affair with Chuck Bass is exposed, Nate approaches Jenny and Blair's affair is made public. Blair's friends shun her for her hypocrisy and establish Jenny as the new Queen Bee of Constance Billard.[3] Despite being one of the school It Girls, she is driven to prove herself. Lacking self-confidence because she is not as rich as the other girls, she sells her sewing machine and barters an expensive dress she stole from one of her friends. When Blair throws her a surprise birthday party, the other girls discover that Jenny stole the dress, bringing Blair's scheme to fruition. Jenny retaliates by bringing Nate with her to Blair's victory party and winning the girls to her side.[4] Jenny and Blair then struggle for the position of Queen Bee. Jenny thinks she's found true love with Asher Hornsby, but their romance is short-lived when she discovers that he is gay. He convinces her to say that she lost her virginity to him in order to dispel the rumors that he is gay, promising that as long as she pretends it's true, he'll give her privileges that the Upper East Side can offer. But Blair and Eric out Asher at his own party, and Jenny confesses that she lied about having sex with him. Blair's clique abandons her once again, and she later finds Blair to tell her that she's won as it's \"not worth it\".[5] In the season finale, Jenny receives an internship at Blair's mother Eleanor's company.\nAt the beginning of season 2, Jenny spends her summer working hard as a new intern for Eleanor Waldorf Designs. She apologizes to Eric for her behavior the previous season. He forgives her and invites her to the White Party in the Hamptons, where he introduces her to Tinsley Mortimer and she proves her worth to one of Eleanor's supervisors.[6]\nEleanor fires Jenny after a critical remark about one of her dresses, but during a citywide blackout, Eleanor realizes her talent and hires Jenny. After constant harassment by Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minions, Jenny decides to skip school to pursue a future in fashion.\nBlair and Serena have another fight about Serena's growing popularity, and Jenny is dragged into it during Eleanor's fashion show. When she changes the seating arrangement Blair had planned, Blair retaliates by telling Rufus that Jenny has been skipping school, and he confronts her. Blair attempts to sabotage Jenny\u2019s work in the show but Jenny improvises, proposing that Serena and the socialites walk the runway. In an effort to ruin Serena, Blair switches the final dress with one that Jenny made, drawing Eleanor's ire. The dress is a huge hit with the audience and the fashion show is a big success. Jenny realizes Blair's frustrations with her friendship with Serena, commenting that they have worked hard for what they\u2019ve wanted and Serena just glides through. Eleanor later praises Jenny for her work.[7]\nRufus eventually agrees to Jenny being home-schooled after seeing how committed and good at her job she is. At work, Jenny befriends Agnes Andrews (Willa Holland), a model who convinces her to start her own fashion line. Realizing that working for Eleanor won't help her develop as a designer and that Eleanor has begun to take advantage of her talents, Jenny leaves.[8] Jenny also begins a short relationship with Nate when they share a passionate kiss after he rescues her from being taken advantage of by an older photographer. Jenny and Rufus argue over her quitting Eleanor\u2019s and Jenny moves out of the Humphreys' apartment and moves in with Agnes, who suggests that they plan a guerrilla fashion show at the charity gala honoring Lily and Bart.[9] The show is a big success but Vanessa witnesses her kissing Nate, thereby straining their friendship. Rufus tries to get her arrested but is stopped by Lily. Agnes's fiery temper and their growing disagreements over the clothing line make it hard for them to close a business deal. Jenny steals Agnes\u2019s contact list, attempting to make a deal by herself. Upon learning of Jenny\u2019s betrayal, Agnes burns all her dresses and kicks her out of her apartment, leaving her with nothing.[10]\nUpon learning that she is too young to start her own business, she attempts to file for emancipation, but Rufus refuses. On Thanksgiving, Lily finds the papers after discovering that Jenny has been hiding in their apartment with Eric, and warns Rufus. Rufus and Jenny reconcile after a little persuasion from Eleanor and she returns home.[11] During the Snowflake Ball, Jenny learns that Vanessa and Nate are back together even though Vanessa was aware of Nate's feelings for her. Nate breaks up with her after she helps to humiliate Vanessa at the ball. Jenny returns to Constance and is forced to contend with Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minions.\nDuring the season finale and Serena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hunt for Gossip Girl, Jenny decides to compete to be the next Queen Bee after Blair leaves. She almost drops out, but Blair gives her a touching speech about keeping her eye on the prize. In the end Blair chooses Jenny and crowns her queen of Constance.[12]\nAfter Jenny fails to bring about egalitarianism at Constance, she resolves to rule as Queen Bee with her own group of minions.[13] With her new position and wealth, Jenny\u2019s social-climbing persona resurfaces and she begins to erase her former Brooklyn self, throwing away her homemade clothes and sewing machine. Worried that Jenny is turning into a typical Queen Bee, Eric and Jonathon attempt an intervention, but are humiliated by Jenny and her clique.[14] Eric teams up with Blair to take down Jenny at the Cotillion Ball by sabotaging her escort. The plan backfires, and Jenny instead secures Nate to escort her, winning her the respect of the Queens at every prep school on the Upper East Side. As a consequence of Eric\u2019s scheming, Jonathan breaks up with him and a rift emerges in Jenny and Eric\u2019s relationship.[15]\nChuck introduces her to Damien Dalgaard, son of the Belgian ambassador, who deals drugs.[16] Liking his wild lifestyle, Jenny strikes up a relationship with him and helps him supply drugs to his customers while sharing in some of the profit, even stealing some of Lily\u2019s \u201cheadache pills\u201d.[17] Lily and Rufus find out about the drugs, which Damien covers up with a story about his father.[18] Against Rufus\u2019s will, Jenny continues her relationship with Damien, who seems interested in taking it further. Jenny, who is a virgin, backs out at the last minute, causing Damien to break up with her, leaving her to face her family.[19]\nAt Rufus\u2019s suggestion, Eleanor reemploys Jenny to help out with her upcoming fashion show. Jenny is happy to be back, but is shocked to learn that one of the models she\u2019ll be working with is Agnes, who, after the show finishes, takes revenge on Jenny by drugging her and leaving her in a bar to be taken advantage of. Nate rescues Jenny before anything happens to her. Because of this, Jenny\u2019s feelings for Nate reawaken and she aspires to win him over.[20] She tries to kiss him but he resists her advances because he sees her only as a friend and because he is dating Serena. Jenny attempts to sabotage Serena and Nate\u2019s relationship by lying to Serena and implying to Nate that she is having an affair with Carter Baizen. Jenny\u2019s attempts fail, and her relationship with both is left tenuous after Nate kicks her out of his apartment.\nAt a gala event where Serena\u2019s recently returned father William Van Der Woodsen is making a speech, a former client of Damien\u2019s approaches Jenny, angrily telling her the drugs she sold her (Lily\u2019s cancer medication) gave her a yeast infection. Rufus overhears this and grounds Jenny to the Humphrey apartment in Brooklyn.[21] During her punishment, Jenny researches Lily\u2019s medicine and tells Chuck there is something very wrong with the medication Serena\u2019s father is prescribing her. It is discovered that William has lied to Lily about her condition and been giving her drugs that make her sick in a plot to win her back from Rufus. Seeing an opportunity to break up Rufus and Lily and return her family to the way it was before, Jenny attempts to sabotage Blair, Chuck, and Nate\u2019s plan to unveil William\u2019s deception. When William is about to be held accountable, she quickly runs to William and warns him, telling him the police are coming to get him, and urges him to escape. Back at the van der Woodsen penthouse she reveals that she warned William and says she wishes her family could go back to normal: \"When I lived in Brooklyn, I may have had to ride the subway to school, and make my own clothes, but at least our family was happy\". Rufus says the only thing that needs to return to normal is Jenny. Eric is hurt by Jenny's attempt to leave the family, and says that if she wants out, no one is forcing her to stay.[22]\nJenny hits rock bottom after sending Gossip Girl a picture of Dan and Serena in bed together, jeopardizing Dan and Nate\u2019s friendship, Dan and Vanessa's relationship, and breaking up Nate and Serena\u2019s relationship. Blair confronts Jenny, telling her, \u201cNate loves Serena, Dan loves Vanessa \u2014 God knows why \u2014 and Chuck loves me. But you, Jenny? No one loves you except your daddy. And after what you pulled yesterday, who knows if that's even true anymore?\u201d[23] Emotionally distressed, Jenny goes to Nate\u2019s apartment but instead finds Chuck devastated over his break-up with Blair and in her state of vulnerability, Jenny loses her virginity to Chuck. Afterward, Blair arrives willing to take Chuck back and Jenny sneaks out. She breaks down in tears to Eric, telling him that everyone hates her and that she slept with Chuck. Eric tells Dan, who confronts Chuck just as he is about to propose to Blair. Jenny, in tears, leaves with Rufus and Lily. A week later, she says her goodbyes to her family and leaves to finish high school with her mother in Hudson.[24]\nJenny has been living in Hudson with her mother since May. Blair finds Jenny preparing for an interview with Tim Gunn, and grants her a special day pass. When Chuck steals Jenny's portfolio, she is forced to visit The Empire Hotel, where Blair had forbidden her to go. This results in Blair and Jenny scheming against each other, and Jenny eventually telling Gossip Girl that she lost her virginity to Chuck, not Damien Dalgaard. While Jenny is left feeling victorious, a defeated Blair blames Chuck. Jenny ultimately realises the damage of her return and decides to leave for good, telling Blair and Chuck that their vindictive games against each other will soon destroy them both.\nJuliet and Vanessa Skype Jenny, asking for help to take down Serena. Jenny doesn't want to go back to her old tricks but also feels Serena is to blame for everything that happened last year and can never take blame for anything, so she agrees to help with the scheme. But when Serena ends up in the hospital after being drugged by Juliet, Jenny tells Juliet that she is going to come clean with everyone about their scheme. Juliet warns her that she will be going down alone. When Jenny appears at the hospital, Vanessa has already pinned the entire scheme on her; unable to defend herself, she leaves, showing up at Blair's later that night, telling her that Juliet was behind everything and that she and Vanessa were merely accomplices. To prove her story, she hands Blair Juliet's masquerade mask and earns Blair's forgiveness. After confessing to Blair, she says she would love to help her take down Juliet, but she should return to Hudson rather than become involved in another scheme.\nIn the premiere episode of season 5, \"Yes, Then Zero,\" Rufus reveals that Jenny moved to London to attend Central Saint Martins.\nIn the final episode of the series, it is revealed that Jenny knew that her brother, Dan Humphrey, was the mysterious blogger behind Gossip Girl. She returns to the Upper East Side, appearing in the five-year time jump for her brother's wedding to Serena van der Woodsen. Jenny works as a designer for Blair's fashion empire, implying that they have gotten over their past animosity. Together they create their own clothing line, \"J for Waldorf\".\nRumors have been made throughout Gossip Girl's first few seasons that Jenny would be given her own spin-off, in line with the character leaving for boarding school just like the novels. News later confirmed that producers did not pick up the spin-off.[25]\nJenny's character further gained prominence during the show's third season. Enid Portugez of the LA Times praised Jenny's fashionable skills, stating that \"Jenny capped off the drama by showing us she's becoming extremely adept at becoming a drug dealer. Her brilliant idea to sew pills into jacket paillettes could have easily won her a \"Project Runway\" challenge! Despite the illegality of it all, it was nice to see Jenny put her wit and wiles to use...\" [26] Following the dramatic events during the third season finale, Michael Ausiello praised both Leighton Meester and Taylor Momsen's performance.[27] L.J. Gibbs, from TV Fanatic, gave the episode a 3.5 rating star out of 5, and said that he felt that Chuck being shot at the end of the episode was a very \"cheap move by the writers\", and that the storyline involving Chuck and Jenny having sex was very \"unlikely\".[28] Mark O. Estes, from TV Overmind, had also praised Taylor Momsen's performance in the episode and said that he \"wish that Jenny had of gotten her own spin-off\", and questions that if her send-off in this episode means that the show's writers have a \"Katherine Heigl\" situation on their hands\".[29] However, Jenny was included in TV Guide's list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.[30]\nWhen asked during a Vanity Fair interview if \"real\" girls could afford the looks from the show, costume designers Eric Daman and Meredith Markworth-Pollack commented on Jenny's style and stated \"Of course! Have fun with it like Jenny Humphrey does, and listen to your fashion sense. Go to a vintage or thrift store and have it tailored so it looks like Marc Jacobs [...] but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about individuality.\" [31]",

        "text": "The Accountant is a 2016 American crime thriller film directed by Gavin O'Connor, written by Bill Dubuque and starring Ben Affleck, Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and John Lithgow. The storyline follows a small-town Illinois certified public accountant with high-functioning autism[3] who actually makes his living uncooking the books of dangerous criminal organizations around the world that are experiencing internal embezzlement.\nThe Accountant premiered in Los Angeles on October 10, 2016, and saw its European premiere in London on October 17.[4] The film was theatrically released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on October 14, 2016. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $155 million worldwide. In 2017, according to MPAA's end of year report, it is the top film for both disc and digital rentals.[5]\nA sequel is currently in development.\nAs a child, Christian Wolff is diagnosed with a high-functioning form of autism at Harbor Neuroscience, where he meets the doctor's daughter, Justine. Chris's father declines the offer for his son to stay at a sensory friendly environment, believing that Chris must overcome the hardships inherent in his condition, but Chris's overwhelmed mother abandons their family. Afraid that others will exploit his son, Chris's father\u2014a US Army PSYOP officer\u2014begins a brutal regimen of stoicism and martial arts training for both him and his brother, Braxton.\nIn the present, Chris works as a forensic accountant from a small strip mall office in Plainfield, Illinois. He unmasks insider financial deceptions, often for criminal and terrorist enterprises. Chris's clients interact with Chris through the Voice, an unidentified woman who calls him \"Dreamboat\". He exposes himself to loud music and flashing lights while abusing his own  shinbone on a daily basis to inure himself to sensory overload.\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) Director Ray King pursues Chris, known to them as \"the Accountant\". King recruits Treasury data analyst Marybeth Medina to help him locate the Accountant. Her leads include Chris's cover names, a recording from his killing of nine members of the Gambino crime family, and some photos.\nChris is hired to audit Living Robotics after the company's founder and CEO, Lamar Blackburn and his sister Rita, learn of discrepancies from in-house accountant Dana Cummings. Chris finds that over $61 million has been embezzled from the company. CFO Ed Chilton, who is diabetic, is forced by a hitman to commit suicide from an insulin overdose. Lamar dismisses Chris, claiming Chilton killed himself because of the investigation of the embezzlement, leaving Chris very distraught because he cannot finish the audit.\nIn a flashback scene, the extent of Chris and his brother's relentless martial arts training instilled by their father as a child is revealed, suggesting that he is an adept fighter in the present day.\nAs a result of his superior self defense capabilities, assassins fail to kill Chris; the last reveals that Dana is the next target. Chris saves her before taking her to his storage unit, containing an Airstream Panamerica with artwork and other valuables, which he uses to quickly flee in when necessary. As they talk, he realizes that the embezzlement at Living Robotics is a scheme like Crazy Eddie's; money stolen from the company is returned to it, boosting profits and increasing the company's valuation as it prepares for an IPO. When Chris goes to confront Rita he finds her dead, exposing Lamar as the embezzler.\nMedina isolates Chris's voice from the recording of the Gambino killing, hearing him repeating the nursery rhyme Solomon Grundy. She learns that his cadence is reminiscent of those with autism, and that Chris's aliases are famed mathematicians, including his current identity, Christian Wolff. Using IRS records, she finds his Illinois office.\nGovernment agents search Chris's heavily secured home. King explains to Medina that Chris was imprisoned at Leavenworth because of a fight at his estranged mother's funeral, where his father was killed protecting Chris. He learned accounting from Francis Silverberg, a Gambino family accountant who became an FBI informant. King was Silverberg's handler, but his inaction led to the informant being brutally killed; King was staking out the Gambinos when Chris came to avenge his mentor. Chris could have killed King, but let him go after asking if he was a good father. King began getting information from the Voice when criminals violated Chris's moral code, and King became director of FinCen. King tells Medina someone has to take over when he retires. The phone rings, and the Voice tells Medina about Living Robotics.\nChris goes to Lamar's mansion, where the hitman and his men await. During the battle, the hitman recognizes Chris repeating the nursery rhyme and reveals that he is Chris's brother Braxton; they have not seen each other since Chris's imprisonment. Braxton attacks Chris, as he is both resentful over his brother's estrangement from him and blames him for their father's death. During a pause in their fight Lamar arrogantly interrupts; Chris shoots him, ending the battle. Chris amicably agrees to meet Braxton in a week, saying he will find him.\nAs another set of parents visits Harbor Neuroscience with their child, the boy meets Justine, still a patient there; she is the Voice, and Chris funds the center with his bookkeeping profits. Dana receives a Jackson Pollock painting she saw in the trailer, as Chris drives out of town with the Airstream in tow.\nOn November 12, 2014, Variety reported that Anna Kendrick was in early talks to co-star in the film, alongside Affleck.[6] Later that day, J. K. Simmons was also announced as being in talks to join the cast.[7] On November 14, 2014, Jon Bernthal was also in talks.[8] On January 6, 2015, Variety reported that Cynthia Addai-Robinson was added to the cast.[9] On January 14, 2015, Jeffrey Tambor[10] and John Lithgow[11] were added to the cast of the film. Lithgow had previously appeared in another thriller about autism, Silent Fall (1994).\nFilming began on January 19, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia.[12][13] On March 16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20, filming was taking place at the Georgia Institute of Technology.[14] The film ends with the Accountant driving on Bethany Bridge over Lake Allatoona, Georgia.\nThe action fighting sequences in the film featured the Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat.[15][16][17]\nOn July 9, 2015, a year before the film's release, it had received graphic novelization published by Vertigo, a limited comic book imprint owned by Warner Bros. Pictures.[18]\nThe film was released on October 14, 2016.[19] Before that, Warner Bros. had scheduled it for January 29, 2016, later moving it to October 7, 2016, before moving it back another week.[20][21]\nThe Accountant grossed $86.3 million in the United States and Canada and $68.9 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $155.2 million, against a production budget of $44 million.[2]\nThe Accountant was released alongside Max Steel and Kevin Hart: What Now?, and was expected to gross $20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 million from 3,332 theaters in its opening weekend, although the studio was projecting a conservative $15 million opening.[22] The film made $1.35 million from its Thursday night previews, more than Affleck's Gone Girl ($1.2 million) in 2014. It grossed $9.1 million on its first day and $24.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office and was the second highest-debut for a thriller of Affleck's career, behind Gone Girl ($37.5 million).[23] In its second weekend, the film grossed $13.6 million (a drop of 44.8%), finishing 4th at the box office.[24]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 254 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Accountant writes off a committed performance from Ben Affleck, leaving viewers with a scattershot action thriller beset by an array of ill-advised deductions.\"[25] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[26] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[27] while comScore reported audiences gave an 84% overall positive score and a 64% definite recommend.[23]\nVince Mancini of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, writing, \"It\u2019s transparent in its attempt both to pimp a future franchise and give autistic kids their own superhero. There\u2019s a genuine sweetness to the latter that converts me on the former. Headshots, math problems, and pained social interactions? Sign me up. Of the two movies Ben Affleck has been in so far this year, The Accountant and Batman V Superman, The Accountant has by far the most franchise potential.\"[28] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying: \"Madness abounds in The Accountant, an intense, intricate, darkly amusing and action-infused thriller that doesn\u2019t always add up but who cares, it\u2019s BIG FUN.\"[29]\nRichard Brody of The New Yorker panned the film, stating: \"This thrill-free thriller...piles up plotlines like an overbuilt house of cards that comes crashing down at the first well-earned guffaw of ridicule.\"[30]\nIn June 2017, it was announced Warner Bros. was developing a sequel, with Affleck, Dubuque and O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor all scheduled to return.[33]",

        "text": "Chinese New Year,[a][2] also known as the Spring Festival in modern China,[b] is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. It is one of several Lunar New Years in Asia. Celebrations traditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first calendar month. The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20[3] In 2018, the first day of the Lunar New Year was on Friday, 16 February, initiating the year of the Dog.\nIt is one of the world's most prominent and celebrated festivals, and involves the largest annual mass human migration in the world. It is a major holiday in Greater China and has strongly influenced the lunar new year celebrations of China's neighbouring cultures, including the Korean New Year (seol), the T\u1ebft of Vietnam, and the Losar of Tibet.[4] It is also celebrated worldwide in countries with significant Overseas Chinese populations, including Singapore,[5] Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Australia, the Philippines[6][7] and  Mauritius,[8] as well as many countries in North America and Europe.[9][10][11]\nThe New Year festival is centuries old and associated with several myths and customs. Traditionally, the festival was a time to honour deities as well as ancestors.[12] Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Lunar New Year vary widely. Often, the evening preceding Lunar New Year's Day is an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly clean the house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for incoming good luck.  Windows and doors are decorated with red colour paper-cuts and couplets with popular themes of \"good fortune\" or \"happiness\", \"wealth\", and \"longevity\". Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes.  In about one third of the Mainland population, or 500 million Northerners, dumplings (especially those of vegetarian fillings) feature prominently in the meals celebrating the festival.\nThe lunisolar Chinese calendar determines the date of Lunar New Year. The calendar is also used in countries that have been influenced by, or have relations with, China\u00a0\u2013 such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam, though occasionally the date celebrated may differ by one day or even one moon cycle due to using a meridian based on a different capital city in a different time zone or different placements of intercalary months.[14]\nChinese calendar defines the lunar month with winter solstice as the 11th month, which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes).[2] In more than 96% of the years, the Chinese New Year's Day is the closest new moon to lichun (Chinese: \u7acb\u6625; \"start of spring\") on 4 or 5 February, and the first new moon after Dahan (Chinese: \u5927\u5bd2; \"major cold\"). In the Gregorian calendar, the Lunar New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February.[13][verification needed]\nThe Gregorian Calendar dates for Chinese New Year from 1912 to 2101 are below, along with the year's presiding animal zodiac and its Stem-branch. The traditional Chinese calendar follows a Metonic cycle (like the modern Jewish Calendar), and returns to the same date in Gregorian calendar roughly. The names of the Earthly Branches have no English counterparts and are not the Chinese translations of the animals.  Alongside the 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac there is a 10-year cycle of heavenly stems. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the five elements of Chinese astrology, namely: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. The elements are rotated every two years while a yin and yang association alternates every year. The elements are thus distinguished: Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, etc. These produce a combined cycle that repeats every 60 years.  For example, the year of the Yang Fire Rat occurred in 1936 and in 1996, 60 years apart.\nMany people inaccurately calculate their Chinese birth-year by converting it from their Gregorian birth-year. As the Chinese New Year starts in late January to mid-February, the previous Chinese year dates through 1 January until that day in the new Gregorian year, remaining unchanged from the previous Gregorian year. For example, the 1989 year of the Snake began on 6 February 1989. The year 1989 is generally aligned with the year of the Snake. However, the 1988 year of the Dragon officially ended on 5 February 1989. This means that anyone born from 1 January to 5 February 1989 was actually born in the year of the Dragon rather than the year of the Snake. Many online Chinese Sign calculators do not account for the non-alignment of the two calendars, using Gregorian-calendar years rather than official Chinese New Year dates.[15]\nOne scheme of continuously numbered Chinese-calendar years assigns 4709 to the year beginning, 2011, but this is not universally accepted; the calendar is traditionally cyclical, not continuously numbered.\nAlthough the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered years, outside China its years are sometimes numbered from the purported reign of the mythical Yellow Emperor in the 3rd millennium BCE. But at least three different years numbered 1 are now used by various scholars, making the year beginning CE 2015 the \"Chinese year\" 4712, 4713, or 4652.[16]\nAccording to tales and legends, the beginning of the Chinese New Year started with a mythical beast called the Nian. Nian would eat villagers, especially children. One year, all the villagers decided to go hide from the beast. An old man appeared before the villagers went into hiding and said that he's going to stay the night, and decided to get revenge on the Nian. All the villagers thought he was insane. The old man put red papers up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town to see that nothing was destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises. When the New Year was about to come, the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors. People also used firecrackers to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk. After that, Nian retreated to a nearby mountain. The name of the mountain has long been lost over the years.[17]\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in a number of countries and territories where there is a sizable Chinese population. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day when the New Year falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February) falls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on the country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names are \"Chinese New Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\nFor New Year celebrations that are lunar but not based on the Chinese New Year (such as Korea's Seollal and Vietnam's T\u1ebft), see the article on Lunar New Year.\nFor other countries where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official holiday, see the section below on Festivities outside China.\nDuring the festival, people around China will prepare different gourmet for families and guests. Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from different places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-known ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.\nOn the eighth day of the lunar month prior to Chinese New Year, the Laba holiday (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u516b; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u516b; pinyin: l\u00e0b\u0101), a traditional porridge, Laba porridge (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u516b\u7ca5; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u516b\u7ca5; pinyin: l\u00e0b\u0101 zh\u014du), is served in remembrance of an ancient festival, called La, that occurred shortly after the winter solstice.[35] Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that believe in Buddhism, the Laba holiday is also considered Bodhi Day. Layue (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u6708; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u6708; pinyin: L\u00e0yu\u00e8) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honor of the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u8089; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u8089; pinyin: l\u00e0r\u00f2u). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends.[36] It's still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La month\" is similar to Advent in Christianity. Many families eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the dirt on nin ya baat\" (Chinese: \u5e74\u5eff\u516b\uff0c\u6d17\u908b\u9062; pinyin: ni\u00e1n ni\u00e0n b\u0101, x\u01d0 l\u0101t\u00e0; Jyutping: nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)), but the practice is not restricted to nin ya baat (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away.  Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year.[37] Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and the word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is prevalent, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the past year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \"send gods back to heaven\" (Chinese: \u9001\u795e; pinyin: s\u00f2ngsh\u00e9n), an example would be burning a paper effigy of Zao Jun the Kitchen God, the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the Jade Emperor of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe passage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember their ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people do not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a Christian prayer offered instead.\nThe biggest event of any Chinese New Year's Eve is the annual reunion dinner. Dishes consisting of special meats are served at the tables, as a main course for the dinner and offering for the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. and remotely similar to Christmas dinner in other countries with a high percentage of Christians.\nIn northern China, it is customary to make dumplings (jiaozi) after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese sycee. In contrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake (niangao) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days. Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o [Pinyin] literally means \"new year cake\" with a homophonous meaning of \"increasingly prosperous year in year out\".[38]\nAfter dinner, some families go to local temples hours before the new year begins to pray for a prosperous new year by lighting the first incense of the year; however in modern practice, many households hold parties and even hold a countdown to the new year. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to scare away evil spirits with the household doors sealed, not to be reopened until the new morning in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" (simplified Chinese: \u5f00\u8d22\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u958b\u8ca1\u9580; pinyin: k\u0101ic\u00e1im\u00e9n).[39]\nBeginning in 1982, the CCTV New Year's Gala is broadcast in China four hours before the start of the New Year and lasts until the succeeding early morning. A tradition of going to bed late on New Year's Eve, or even keeping awake the whole night and morning, known as shousui (\u5b88\u5c81), is still practised as it is thought to add on to one's parents' longevity.\nThe first day is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and earth, officially beginning at midnight. It is a traditional practice to light fireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers and to make as much of a din as possible to chase off the evil spirits as encapsulated by nian  of which the term Guo Nian was derived. Many Buddhists abstain from meat consumption on the first day because it is believed to ensure longevity for them. Some consider lighting fires and using knives to be bad luck on New Year's Day, so all food to be consumed is cooked the days before. On this day, it is considered bad luck to use the broom, as good fortune is not to be \"swept away\" symbolically.\nMost importantly, the first day of Chinese New Year is a time to honor one's elders and families visit the oldest and most senior members of their extended families, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.\nFor Buddhists, the first day is also the birthday of Maitreya Bodhisattva (better known as the more familiar Budai Luohan), the Buddha-to-be. People also abstain from killing animals.\nSome families may invite a lion dance troupe as a symbolic ritual to usher in the Chinese New Year as well as to evict bad spirits from the premises. Members of the family who are married also give red envelopes containing cash known as lai see (Cantonese dialect) or angpow (Hokkien dialect/Fujian), or hongbao (Mandarin), a form of blessings and to suppress the aging and challenges associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family, mostly children and teenagers. Business managers also give bonuses through red packets to employees for good luck, smooth-sailing, good health and wealth.\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions have banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various city governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years) issued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city. As a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by governments in such city-states as Hong Kong and Singapore. However, it is a tradition that the indigenous peoples of the walled villages of New Territories, Hong Kong are permitted to light firecrackers and launch fireworks in a limited scale.\nThe second day of the Chinese New Year, known as \"beginning of the year\" (simplified Chinese: \u5f00\u5e74; traditional Chinese: \u958b\u5e74; pinyin: k\u0101ini\u00e1n),[40] was when married daughters visited their birth parents, relatives and close friends. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to visit their birth families frequently.)\nDuring the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people circulate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth] shouting, \"Cai Shen dao!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"[41] Householders would respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of the Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their business on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year so they will be blessed with good luck and prosperity in their business for the year.\nAs this day is believed to be The Birthday of Che Kung, a deity worshipped in Hong Kong, worshippers go to Che Kung Temples to pray for his blessing. A representative from the government asks Che Kung about the city's fortune through kau cim.\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" (Chinese: \u8d64\u53e3; pinyin: Ch\u00eck\u01d2u). Chikou is also called \"Chigou's Day\" (Chinese: \u8d64\u72d7\u65e5; pinyin: Ch\u00ecg\u01d2ur\u00ec). Chigou, literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\" (Chinese: \u719b\u6012\u4e4b\u795e; pinyin: Bi\u0101o n\u00f9 zh\u012b sh\u00e9n). Rural villagers continue the tradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an unlucky day to have guests or go visiting.[42][43] Hakka villagers in rural Hong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed everyone should stay at home.[44] This is also considered a propitious day to visit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth day is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to normal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate and welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat jiaozi, or dumplings, on the morning of powu (Chinese: \u7834\u4e94; pinyin: p\u00f2w\u01d4). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on the next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off firecrackers to get Guan Yu's attention, thus ensuring his favor and good fortune for the new year.[45]\nThe seventh day, traditionally known as Renri (the common person's birthday), is the day when everyone grows one year older. In some overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Singapore, it is also the day when tossed raw fish salad, yusheng, is eaten for continued wealth and prosperity.\nFor many Chinese Buddhists, this is another day to avoid meat, the seventh day commemorating the birth of Sakra, lord of the devas in Buddhist cosmology who is analogous to the Jade Emperor.\nAnother family dinner is held to celebrate the eve of the birth of the Jade Emperor, the ruler of heaven. People normally return to work by the eighth day, therefore the Store owners will host a lunch/dinner with their employees, thanking their employees for the work they have done for the whole year.\nApproaching 12 midnight on this day, Hokkien people prepare for the \"Jade Emperor ritual\" (Hokkien: \u62dc\u5929\u516c P\u00e0i Thi\u207f-kong) during which incense is burnt and food offerings made to the Jade Emperor and also to Zao Jun, the Kitchen god who reports on each family to the Jade Emperor.\nSome people will hold a ritual prayer after midnight on the eighth day. In Malaysia, especially, people light fireworks, often more than on the first day.\nThis practice of Bai Ti Gong can also be seen in Singapore and Indonesia, especially in Hokkien-speaking Chinese areas like Sumatra.\nThe ninth day of the New Year is a day for Chinese to offer prayers to the Jade Emperor of Heaven in the Daoist Pantheon.[46] The ninth day is traditionally the birthday of the Jade Emperor. This day, called Ti Kong Dan (Hokkien: \u5929\u516c\u8bde Thi\u207f-kong Tan), Ti Kong Si (Hokkien: \u5929\u516c\u751f Thi\u207f-kong Si\u207f) or Pai Ti Kong (Hokkien: \u62dc\u5929\u516c P\u00e0i Thi\u207f-kong), is especially important to Hokkiens, even more important than the first day of the Chinese New Year.[47]\nCome midnight of the eighth day of the new year, Hokkiens will offer thanks to the Emperor of Heaven. A prominent requisite offering is sugarcane.[47] Legend holds that the Hokkien were spared from a massacre by Japanese pirates by hiding in a sugarcane plantation during the eighth and ninth days of the Chinese New Year, coinciding with the Jade Emperor's birthday.[47] Since \"sugarcane\" (Hokkien:  \u7518\u8517 kam-chi\u00e0) is a near homonym to \"thank you\" (Hokkien:  \u611f\u8b1d k\u00e1m-si\u0101) in the Hokkien dialect, Hokkiens offer sugarcane on the eve of his birthday, symbolic of their gratitude.[47]\nIn the morning of this birthday (traditionally anytime from midnight to 7\u00a0am), Taiwanese households set up an altar table with 3 layers: one top (containing offertories of six vegetables (Chinese: \u516d\u9f4b; pinyin: li\u00f9 zh\u0101i), noodles, fruits, cakes, tangyuan, vegetable bowls, and unripe betel, all decorated with paper lanterns) and two lower levels (containing the five sacrifices and wines) to honor the deities below the Jade Emperor.[46] The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay obeisance and wish him a long life.[46]\nIncense, tea, fruit, vegetarian food or roast pig, and gold paper is served as a customary protocol for paying respect to an honored person.\nThe Jade Emperor's party is celebrated on this day.\nThe fifteenth day of the new year is celebrated as \"Yuanxiao Festival\" (simplified Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5\u7bc0; pinyin: Yu\u00e1n xi\u0101o ji\u00e9), also known as \"Shangyuan Festival\" (simplified Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u7bc0; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ng yu\u00e1n ji\u00e9) or the Lantern Festival (otherwise known as Chap Goh Mei Chinese: \u5341\u4e94\u669d; pinyin: Sh\u00edw\u01d4m\u00edng; literally: \"the fifteen night\" in Fujian dialect). Rice dumplings tangyuan (simplified Chinese: \u6c64\u5706; traditional Chinese: \u6e6f\u5713; pinyin: tang yu\u00e1n), a sweet glutinous rice ball brewed in a soup, are eaten this day.  Candles are lit outside houses as a way to guide wayward spirits home.  This day is celebrated as the Lantern Festival, and families walk the street carrying lighted lanterns.\nIn China, Malaysia, and Singapore, this day is celebrated by individuals seeking a romantic partner, akin to Valentine's Day.[48] Nowadays, single women write their contact number on mandarin oranges and throw them in a river or a lake after which single men collect the oranges and eat them. The taste is an indication of their possible love: sweet represents a good fate while sour represents a bad fate.\nThis day often marks the end of the Chinese New Year festivities.\nA reunion dinner, named as \"Nian Ye Fan\", is held on New Year's Eve during which family members gather for a celebration. The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a communal hot pot as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and Chinese sausage) and seafood (e.g. lobster and abalone) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish (traditional Chinese: \u9b5a; simplified Chinese: \u9c7c; pinyin: y\u00fa) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase \"may there be surpluses every year\" (traditional Chinese: \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918; simplified Chinese: \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59; pinyin: ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa) sounds the same as \"let there be fish every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to reflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the previous year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\nRed packets for the immediate family are sometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets often contain money in certain numbers that reflect good luck and honorability. Several foods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of the Chinese food names are homophones for words that also mean good things.\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special precedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names with prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\nIn 1928, the ruling Kuomintang party in China decreed that Chinese New Year will fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar, but this was abandoned due to overwhelming opposition from the populace. In 1967 during the Cultural Revolution, official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public should  \"Change Customs\", have a \"revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival\", and since people needed to work on Chinese New Year Eve, they didn't have holidays during Spring Festival day. The public celebrations were reinstated by the time of the Chinese economic reform.[51]\nTraditionally, red envelopes or red packets \n(Cantonese: lai sze or lai see; \u5229\u662f, \u5229\u5e02 or \u5229\u4e8b; Pinyin: l\u00ecsh\u00ec; Mandarin: h\u00f3ngb\u0101o \u7ea2\u5305; Hokkien: ang pow; POJ: \u00e2ng-pau; Hakka: fung bao) are passed out during the Chinese New Year's celebrations, from married couples or the elderly to unmarried juniors. It is also common for adults or young couples to give red packets to children.\nDuring this period, red packets are also known as \u58d3\u6b72\u9322/\u538b\u5c81\u94b1 (y\u00e0su\u00ecqi\u00e1n, which was evolved from \u58d3\u795f\u9322/\u538b\u795f\u94b1, literally, \"the money used to suppress or put down the evil spirit\").[52]\nRed packets almost always contain money, usually varying from a couple of dollars to several hundred. Per custom, the amount of money in the red packets should be of even numbers, as odd numbers are associated with cash given during funerals (\u5e1b\u91d1: b\u00e1ij\u012bn). The number 8 is considered lucky (for its homophone for \"wealth\"), and $8 is commonly found in the red envelopes in the US. The number six (\u516d, li\u00f9) is also very lucky as it sounds like \"smooth\" (\u6d41, li\u00fa), in the sense of having a smooth year. The number four (\u56db) is the worst because its homophone is \"death\" (\u6b7b). Sometimes chocolate coins are found in the red packets.\nOdd and even numbers are determined by the first digit, rather than the last. Thirty and fifty, for example, are odd numbers and are thus appropriate as funeral cash gifts. However, it is common and quite acceptable to have cash gifts in a red packet using a single bank note\u00a0\u2013 with ten or fifty yuan bills used frequently. It is customary for the bills to be brand new printed money. Everything regarding the New Year has to be new in order to have good luck and fortune.\nThe act of asking for red packets is normally called (Mandarin): \u8ba8\u7d05\u5305 t\u01ceo-h\u00f3ngb\u0101o, \u8981\u5229\u662f or (Cantonese): \u9017\u5229\u662f. A married person would not turn down such a request as it would mean that he or she would be \"out of luck\" in the new year. Red packets are generally given by established married couples to the younger non-married children of the family. It is custom and polite for children to wish elders a happy new year and a year of happiness, health and good fortune before accepting the red envelope. Red envelopes are then kept under the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before opening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\nIn Taiwan in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to maids, nurses or domestic workers from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is appropriate is controversial.[53][54]\nThe Japanese have a similar tradition of giving money during the New Year, called Otoshidama.\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to younger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged between friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New Year. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their homes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, and never pears), cakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies.\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered taboo. Taboo gifts include:[55][56][57]\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These usually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers, toys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for people to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home decorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect plum tree is not dissimilar to the Western tradition of buying a Christmas tree.\nHong Kong filmmakers also release \"New Year celebration films\" (\u8cc0\u6b72\u7247), mostly comedies, at this time of year.\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions were once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times, this method has eventually evolved into the use of firecrackers during the festive season. Firecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down. Each firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with gunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping noise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the firecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to scare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful time of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year celebrations.[58]\nThe use of firecrackers, although a traditional part of the celebration, has over the years led to many unfortunate outcomes. There have been reported incidents every year of users of fireworks being blinded, losing body parts, or suffering other grievous injuries, especially during the Chinese New Year season. Hence, many governments and authorities eventually enacted laws completely banning the use of firecrackers privately, primarily because of safety issues.\n\"Happy New Year!\" (Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u597d\u5440; pinyin: X\u012bn Ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo Ya; literally: \"New Year's Good, Ya\") is a popular children's song for the New Year holiday.[66] The melody is similar to the American folk song, Oh My Darling, Clementine.\nClothing mainly featuring the color red or bright colors is commonly worn throughout the Chinese New Year because it was once believed that red could scare away evil spirits and bad fortune. In addition, people typically wear new clothes from head to toe to symbolize a new beginning in the new year. Wearing new clothes also symbolizes having more than enough things to use and wear in the new year. Red is a color of good luck.\nIn some places, the taking of a family portrait is an important ceremony after the relatives are gathered. The photo is taken at the hall of the house or taken in front of the house. The most senior male head of the family sits in the center.\nAs with all cultures, Chinese New Year traditions incorporate elements that are symbolic of deeper meaning.  One common example of Chinese New Year symbolism is the red diamond-shaped fu characters (Chinese: \u798f; pinyin: f\u00fa; Cantonese Yale: fuk1; literally: \"blessings, happiness\"), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese homes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word dao (Chinese: \u5012; pinyin: d\u00e0o; literally: \"upside down\"), is homophonous or nearly homophonous with (Chinese: \u5230; pinyin: d\u00e0o; literally: \"arrive\") in all varieties of Chinese. Therefore, it symbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity.\nFor the Cantonese-speaking people, if the fu sign is hung upside down, the implied dao (upside down) sounds like the Cantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would usually symbolize bad luck; this is why the fu character is not usually hung upside-down in Cantonese communities.\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem of joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the Chinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal personage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many things associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are colored red. The sound of the Chinese word for \"red\" (simplified Chinese: \u7ea2; traditional Chinese: \u7d05; pinyin: h\u00f3ng; Cantonese Yale: hung4) is in Mandarin homophonous with the word for \"prosperous\". Therefore, red is an auspicious color and has an auspicious sound.\nNianhua can be a form of Chinese colored woodblock printing, for decoration during Chinese New Year.[67]\nThe following are popular floral decorations for the New Year and are available at new year markets.\nTraditionally, families gather together during the Chinese New Year. In modern China, migrant workers in China travel home to have reunion dinners with their families on Chinese New Year's Eve. Owing to a large number of interprovincial travelers, special arrangements were made by railways, buses and airlines starting from 15 days before the New Year's Day. This 40-day period is called chunyun, and is known as the world's largest annual migration.[68] More interurban trips are taken in mainland China in this period than the total population of China.\nIn Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is in a north-south direction: long distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and its islands is less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in 2003 as part of Three Links, mostly for \"Taiwanese businessmen\" to return to Taiwan for the new year.[69]\nChinese New Year is also celebrated annually in many countries with significant Chinese populations. These include countries throughout Asia, Oceania, and North America. Sydney,[70] London,[71] and San Francisco[72] claim to host the largest New Year celebration outside of Asia and South America.\nIn some countries of Southeast Asia, Chinese New Year is a national public holiday and considered to be one of the most important holidays of the year. Chinese New Year's Eve is typically a half-day holiday for Malaysia and Singapore. The biggest celebrations take place in Malaysia (notably in Kuala Lumpur, George Town and Klang) and Singapore.[73]\nIn Singapore, Chinese New Year is accompanied by various festive activities. One of the main highlights is the Chinatown celebrations. In 2010, this included a Festive Street Bazaar, nightly staged shows at Kreta Ayer Square and a lion dance competition.[74] The Chingay Parade also features prominently in the celebrations. It is an annual street parade in Singapore, well known for its colorful floats and wide variety of cultural performances.[75] The highlights of the Parade for 2011 include a Fire Party, multi-ethnic performances and an unprecedented travelling dance competition.[76]\nIn Philippines, Chinese New Year is considered to be the most important festival for Filipino-Chinese, and its celebration has also extended to the non-Chinese majority Filipinos. In 2012, Chinese New Year was included in public holidays in the Philippines, which is only the New Year's Day itself.\nIn Indonesia, the Chinese New Year is officially named as Hari Tahun Baru Imlek,[77][78][79] or Sin Cia in Hokkien.[80] It was celebrated as one of the official national religious holiday by Chinese-Indonesians since 18 June 1946 to 1 January 1953 through government regulation signed by President Sukarno on 18 June 1946.[77][81] It was unofficially celebrated by ethnic Chinese from 1953 to 1967 based on government regulation signed by Vice President Muhammad Hatta in 5 February 1953 which annul the previous regulation, among others, the Chinese New Year as a national religious holiday,.[77][82] Effectively from 6 December 1967,[83] until 1998,[84] the spiritual practice to celebrate the Chinese New Year by Chinese families was restricted specifically only inside of the Chinese house. This restriction is made by Indonesian government through a Presidential Instruction, Instruksi Presiden No.14 Tahun 1967, signed by President Suharto. This restriction is ended when the regime has changed and the President Suharto was overthrown.[85] The celebration is conducted unofficially by Chinese community from 1999 to 2000. On 17 January 2000, the President Abdurrahman Wahid issued a Presidential Decree through Keputusan Presiden RI No 6 Tahun 2000 to annul Instruksi Presiden No.14 Tahun 1967.[86] On 19 January 2001, the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kementerian Agama Republik Indonesia) issued a Decree through Keputusan Menteri Agama RI No 13 Tahun 2001 tentang Imlek sebagai Hari Libur Nasional to set of Hari Tahun Baru Imlek as a Facultative Holiday for Chinese Community.[77][87]  Through the Presidential Decree it was officially declared as a 1 (one) day public religious holiday as of 9 April 2002 by President Megawati.[79] The Indonesian government authorize only the first day of the Chinese New Year as a public religious holiday and it is specifically designated only for Chinese people.[77][78][79][81][82][88][89] In Indonesia, the first day of the Chinese New Year is recognized as a part of the celebration of the Chinese religion and tradition of Chinese community.[78][79][81][82][87] There are no other official or unofficial of the Chinese New Year as a public holiday. The remaining 14 days are celebrated only by ethnic Chinese families.[77][90] In Indonesia, the Chinese Year is named as a year of K\u01d2ngz\u01d0 (\u5b54\u5b50) or Kongzili in Bahasa Indonesia. Every year, the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kementerian Agama Republik Indonesia) set the specific date of religious holiday based on input from religious leaders.[90] The Chinese New Year is the only national religious holiday in Indonesia that was enacted specifically with the Presidential Decree, in this case with the Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia (Keppres RI) No 19 Tahun 2002 dated on 9 April 2002.[78][79] The celebration of the Chinese New Year as a religious holiday is specifically intended only for Chinese People in Indonesia (tradisi masyarakat Cina yang dirayakan secara turun temurun di berbagai wilayah di Indonesia,[79] dan umat Agama Tionghoa[81]) and it is not intended to be celebrated by Indonesian Indigenous Peoples or Masyarakat Pribumi Indonesia.[78][79][81][82][83][87]\nOddly and funny, most Chinese-Indonesian who are not adhere to Chinese religion thinks and believes that the Chinese New Year is only for one day, in this case is on the first day, and the remaining day especially on the fifteenth day is not considered as a part of Chinese New Year. The same things is happening to Indonesian Indigenous peoples who insists that the fifteenth day of the Chinese New Year is a kind of jamboree or carnival and thinks it has not related with Chinese New Year at all. It is believed that this behaviour occurs because of the religion dilemma where mostly a majority of Indigenous peoples in Indonesia are religious thus by denying that the Chinese New Year activities are not related with any of religion then they can make a justification to participate and celebrate the Chinese New Year especially on the fifteenth day of the celebration. Their primary motives to participate the Chinese New Year festival and Chinese religion activities are money from carrying the Chinese gods statues, playing the lion and dragon dance and free foods, and the opportunity to meet and seeking a Chinese partner for marriages. Some are even trying to find a mate to have a sexual intercourse during the festival. A large number of Non-Chinese men are even continue to come to the Chinese temple on a regular basis to pray to the Chinese deities and wishing to get for an ethnic Chinese woman as a wife. Some have succeed in marrying with ethnic Chinese. Sadly, all of the descendant of this mix-marriages claim that they have a pure blood of Chinese descendant. By marrying a Chinese, and actively participate as a follower of Chinese religion and thus to get into the deep of the inside environment of ethnic Chinese family inner-circle, the Non-Chinese people believed that they can upgrade their social and financial status instantly. To disguise their identity many changed their Indonesian name into Chinese look-alike name and falsified their ancestral history family tree. A lot of Non-Chinese people who have married also put in their children to Chinese temple[91] and Chinese school with the hope that as they grow-up they have the first opportunity to marry with the Chinese. After marrying with Chinese people, most of the Non-Chinese people, if not all, including their children are always claiming and insists that they have a pure blood of a Chinese descendant, consequently, mostly, if not all, the Chinese people itself in Indonesia, because of lack of comparisons, can not differentiate who is a Chinese and who is not.[92][93] Furthermore, because of this ignorance, more and more of Chinese people in Indonesia thinks they are already marrying with a Chinese because they have met at the Chinese temple. They assume that only Chinese people goes to the Chinese temple, but the truth is not. No wonder that at least 90%, if not all, of Chinese-Indonesian who claimed that they have a pure blood of Chinese have a very different skin complexion, and a different physical characteristics with an odd facial features compares with the other Chinese people in the world. Everyone even want to claim that they are a Chinese descendant even though their DNA is not a Chinese at all. This phenomenon explains why there are crowds on every Chinese New Year events and roughly 90% of Chinese temple visitors in some places are Indonesian Indigenous peoples and a descendant of a mix-marriages even though the Chinese community only accounted for 1,2\u00c2\u00a0%,[94] of Indonesian population. Some of Non-Chinese and Chinese people are also celebrated Chinese New Year inside a Church with dragon dance, incense for praying and food offerings to Mary, Mother of Jesus and Jesus Christ.[95][96][97] Because of the majority of Chinese temple congregation are Non-Chinese people, consequently they are also bringing their own culture, customs, beliefs and ritual of worship of their gods to be practiced inside the Chinese temple,[98][99] thus in some parts of Indonesia the practice of Chinese religion and Chinese New Year would be totally different with the other Chinese community in the other parts of the world.[91][100][101][102][103][104][105] Some of Non-Chinese people who have a deep knowledge of Chinese religion is becoming the Chinese religious leaders and routinely gives preaching to Chinese community. Some are even becoming the chairman and the leaders of the Chinese religious association.[106][107] There are tons of evidence supporting the above statements, anyone who want to pursue further about this matter is encouraged to go to Facebook.com and do research using the keywords, such as: kelenteng indonesia, klenteng indonesia, bio indonesia, vihara indonesia and to study carefully in detail about the social changes of the Chinese community in Indonesia especially in relation with the identity as a Chinese, the practice of Chinese religion and the practice of Chinese New Year celebration.\nBig Chinese population cities and towns like Jakarta, Medan, Singkawang, Pangkal Pinang, Binjai, Bagansiapiapi, Tanjungbalai, Pematangsiantar, Selat Panjang, Tanjung Pinang, Batam, Ketapang and Pontianak always have its own New Year's celebration every years with parade and fireworks. A lot shopping malls decorated its building with lantern, Chinese words and lion or dragon with red and gold as main color. Lion dance is a common sight around Chinese houses, temples and its shophouses. Usually, the Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist Chinese will burn a big incense made by aloeswood with dragon-decorated at front of their house.The temple is open 24 hours at the first day, their also distributes a red envelopes and sometimes rice, fruits or sugar to the poor around.\nWith one of the largest Chinese populations outside of Asia, Sydney also claims to have the largest Chinese New Year Celebrations outside of Asia with over 600,000 people attending the celebrations in Chinatown annually. The events there span over three weeks including the launch celebration, outdoor markets, evening street food stalls, Chinese top opera performances, dragon boat races, a film festival and multiple parades that incorporate Chinese, Japanese, Korean people and Vietnamese performers. More than 100,000 people attend notably the main parade with over 3,500 performers.[108] The festival also attracts international media coverage, reaching millions of viewers in Asia.[109] The festival in Sydney is organized in partnership with a different Chinese province each year. Apart from Sydney, other state capital cities in Australia also celebrate Chinese New Year due to large number of Chinese residents.[110] The cities include: Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne Box Hill and Perth. The common activities are lion dance, dragon dance, New Year market, and food festival. In the Melbourne suburb of Footscray, Victoria a Lunar New Year celebration initially focusing on the Vietnamese New Year has expanded into a celebration of the Chinese New Year as well as the April New Year celebrations of the Thais, Cambodians, Laotians and other Asian Australian communities who celebrate the New Year in either January/February or April.[111]\nThe city of Wellington hosts a two-day weekend festival for Chinese New Year,[112] and a one-day festival is held in Dunedin, centred on the city's Chinese gardens.[113]\nMany cities in North America sponsor official parades for Chinese New Year. Among the cities with such parades are San Francisco,[114] Los Angeles,[115] New York City,[116] Boston,[117] Chicago,[118] Mexico City,[119] Toronto, and Vancouver.[120] However, even smaller cities that are historically connected to Chinese immigration, such as Butte, Montana,[121] have recently hosted parades.\nMultiple groups in New York City cooperate to sponsor a week-long Lunar New Year celebration. The festivities include cultural festival,[116] music concert,[122] fireworks on the Hudson River near the Chinese Consulate,[123] and special exhibits.[122] In June 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the Lunar New Year would be made a public school holiday.[124]\nThe San Francisco Chinese New Year Festival and Parade is the oldest and largest event of its kind outside of Asia, and the largest Asian cultural event in North America.\nThe festival incorporates Grant and Kearny Streets into its street festival and parade route, respectively.  The use of these streets traces its lineage back to early parades beginning the custom in San Francisco. In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing California Gold Rush, over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life. Among those were many Chinese, who had come to work in the gold mines and on the railroad. By the 1860s, the residents of San Francisco's Chinatown were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favorite American tradition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the parade. They invited a variety of other groups from the city to participate, and they marched down what today are Grant Avenue and Kearny Street carrying colorful flags, banners, lanterns, drums, and firecrackers to drive away evil spirits.\nIn San Francisco, over 100 units participate in the annual Chinese New Year Parade held since 1958.[125] The parade is attended by some 500,000 people along with another 3 million TV viewers.[126]\nIn London, the celebrations take place throughout Chinatown, Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. Festivities include a parade, cultural feast, fireworks, concerts and performances.[127] The celebration attracts between 300,000 and 500,000 people yearly according to the organisers.[128]\nIn Paris, the celebrations are held since the 1980s in several districts during one month with many performances[129] and the main of the three parades with 40 groups and 4,000 performers is attended alone by more than 200,000 people in the 13th arrondissement.[130][131]\nMany celebrate the festival in Chinatown, Kolkata, India where a significant community of people of Chinese origin exists. In Kolkata, Chinese New Year is celebrated with lion and dragon dance.\nIn Pakistan, the Chinese New Year is also celebrated among the sizable Chinese expatriate community that lives in the country. During the festival, the Chinese embassy in Islamabad arranges various cultural events in which Pakistani arts and cultural organizations and members of the civil society also participate.[132][133][134][135]\nThe Chinese New Year is often accompanied by loud, enthusiastic greetings, often referred to as \u5409\u7965\u8a71 (j\u00edxi\u00e1nghu\u00e0) in Mandarin or \u5409\u5229\u8aaa\u8a71 (Kat Lei Seut Wa) in Cantonese, loosely translated as auspicious words or phrases. New Year couplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as chunlian (\u6625\u806f) or fai chun (\u63ee\u6625), is another way of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), but did not become widespread until then.[136] Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\nSome of the most common greetings include:\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no one in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects during the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say \u6b72\u6b72\u5e73\u5b89 (Su\u00ecsu\u00ec-p\u00edng'\u0101n) immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after year\". Su\u00ec (\u6b72), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with \u788e (su\u00ec) (meaning \"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in auspicious phrases. Similarly, \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 (ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa), a wish for surpluses and bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word y\u00fa that can also refer to \u9b5a (y\u00fa meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new year dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or presented as gifts.\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters, such as the following:\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their red packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when tossing the shredded ingredients of yusheng particularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can also pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year to come.\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u7d05\u5305\u62ff\u4f86 (in Traditional Chinese; Simplified Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22\uff0c\u7ea2\u5305\u62ff\u6765; Pinyin: g\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i, h\u00f3ngb\u0101o n\u00e1l\u00e1i; Cantonese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86; Jyutping: gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In Hakka the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu loi' which would be written as \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u7d05\u5305\u9017\u4f86 \u2013 a mixture of the Cantonese and Mandarin variants of the saying.\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u6597\u96f6\u5514\u611b (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the pop song Kowloon Hong Kong by Reynettes in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u4f0d\u6beb\u5acc\u5c11,\u58f9\u868a\u5514\u611b (Cantonese), roughly translated as, \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked small change \u2013 coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: \u786c\u5622).  Instead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: \u8edf\u5622), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note.",

        "text": "The Mali Empire (Manding: Nyeni[5] or Niani; also historically referred to as the Manden Kurufaba,[1] sometimes shortened to Manden) was an empire in West Africa from c. 1230 to 1670. The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita and became renowned for the wealth of its rulers, especially Musa Keita. The Manding languages were spoken in the empire. It was the largest empire in West Africa and profoundly influenced the culture of West Africa through the spread of its language, laws and customs.[6] Much of the recorded information about the Mali Empire comes from 14th century North African Arab historian Ibn Khaldun, 14th century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta and 16th century Moroccan traveller Leo Africanus. The other major source of information is Mandinka oral tradition, through storytellers known as griots.[7]\nThe empire began as a small Mandinka kingdom at the upper reaches of the Niger River, centred around the town of Niani (the empire's namesake in Manding). During the 11th and 12th centuries, it began to develop as an empire following the decline of the Ghana Empire to the north. During this period, trade routes shifted southward to the savanna, stimulating the growth of states. The early history of the Mali Empire (before the 13th century) is unclear, as there are conflicting and imprecise accounts by both Arab chroniclers and oral traditionalists. Sundiata Keita (c. 1214\u2013c. 1255) is the first ruler about whom there is accurate written information (from Ibn Khaldun). Sundiata Keita was a warrior-prince of the Keita dynasty who was called upon to free the Mali people from the rule of the king of the Sosso Empire, Soumaoro Kant\u00e9. The conquest of Sosso in c. 1235 gave the Mali Empire access to the trans-Saharan trade routes. Following the death of Sundiata Keita in c. 1255, the kings of Mali were referred to by the title mansa.[7]\nSundiata's nephew Mansa Musa made a Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca during the reign of the Mamluk Sultan Baibars (r. 1260\u20131277). Following a series of usurpations of the throne of Mali, in c. 1285 Sakoura, a former royal court slave, became emperor and was one of its most powerful rulers, greatly expanding the territories of Mali. He made a pilgrimage to Mecca during the reign of Mamluk Sultan An-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1298\u20131308). Dying on his return, the throne reverted to the descendants of Sundiata Keita. After the reigns of three more emperors, Musa Keita became emperor in c. 1312. Musa made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca from 1324 to 1326. His generous gifts to Mamluk Egypt and his expenditure of gold caused gold to be greatly devalued, which gave rise to his fame outside of Mali. In 1337, he was succeeded by his son Maghan I, who in 1341 was deposed by his uncle Suleyman. It was during Suleyman's reign that Ibn Battuta visited Mali.[8]\nFollowing this period, a period of weak emperors, conflicts and disunity began in Mali. Ibn Khaldun died in 1406, and following his death there was no continuous record of events in the Mali Empire. It is known from the Tarikh al-Sudan that Mali was still a sizeable state in the 15th century. The Venetian explorer Alvise Cadamosto and Portuguese traders confirmed that the peoples of the Gambia were still subject to the mansa of Mali.[9] Upon Leo Africanus's visit at the beginning of the 16th century, his descriptions of the territorial domains of Mali showed that it was still a kingdom of considerable size. However, from 1507 neighbouring states such as Diara, Great Fulo and the Songhay Empire were eroding the extreme territories of Mali. In 1542, the Songhay invaded the capital city of Niani but were unsuccessful in conquering the empire. During the 17th century, the Mali empire faced incursions from the Bamana Empire. After unsuccessful attempts by Mansa Mama Maghan to conquer Bamana, in 1670 Bamana sacked and burned Niani, and the Mali Empire rapidly disintegrated and ceased to exist, being replaced by independent chiefdoms. The Keitas retreated to the town of Kangaba, where they became provincial chiefs.[10]\nThe Rock art in the Sahara suggests that northern Mali has been inhabited since 10,000 BC, when the Sahara was fertile and rich in wildlife. By 300 BC, large organised settlements had developed, most notable near Djenn\u00e9, one of West Africa's oldest cities. By the 6th century AD, the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in gold, salt and slaves had begun, facilitating the rise of West Africa's great empires.\nThere are a few references to Mali in early written literature. Among these are references to \"Pene\" and \"Malal\" in the work of al-Bakri in 1068,[11] the story of the conversion of an early ruler, known to Ibn Khaldun (by 1397) as Barmandana,[12] and a few geographical details in the work of al-Idrisi.[13]\nIn the 1960s, archaeological work at Niani village, reputed to be the capital of the Mali Empire, by Polish and Guinean archaeologists revealed the remains of a substantial town dating back as far as the 6th century.[14]\nModern oral traditions also related that the Mandinka kingdoms of Mali or Manden had already existed several centuries before Sundiata's unification as a small state just to the south of the Sonink\u00c3\u00a9 empire of Wagadou, better known as the Ghana Empire.[15] This area was composed of mountains, savannah and forest providing ideal protection and resources for the population of hunters.[16] Those not living in the mountains formed small city-states such as Toron, Ka-Ba and Niani. Through the oral tradition of griots, the Keita dynasty, from which nearly every Mali emperor came, traces its lineage back to Lawalo, one of the sons of Bilal,[17] the faithful muezzin of Islam's prophet Muhammad, who was said to have migrated into Mali and his descendants established the ruling Keita dynasty through Maghan Kon Fatta, father of Sundiata Keita.[18]\nIt was common practice during the Middle Ages for both Christian and Muslim rulers to tie their bloodline back to a pivotal figure in their faith's history, so the lineage of the Keita dynasty may be dubious at best,[citation needed] yet African Muslim scholars like the London-based Nigerian-British cleric Sheikh Abu-Abdullah Adelabu have laid claim of divine attainments to the reign of Mansa Mousa: \"in Islamic history and its science stories of Shihab al-Umari and similar legendaries of Mansa Kankan Musa existed in early Arabic sources for West African history by the author of Subh al-a 'sha one of the final expressions of the genre of Arabic administrative literature, Ahmad al-Qalqashandi Egyptian writer, mathematician and scribe of the scroll (katib al-darj) in the Mamluk chancery in Cairo[19] as well as by the author of Kitab al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik (Book of Highways and Kingdoms) Ab\u016b \u02bfUbayd Al-Bakri, an Arab Andalusian Muslim geographer and historian emboldened Keita Dynasty\", wrote Adelabu.[incomprehensible][relevant? \u2013 discuss]\nAdelabu, the head of Awqaf Africa in London, coined the Arabic derivatives \u0643 \u2013 \u0648 \u2013 \u064a K(a)-W(e)-Y(a) of the word Keita which in (in what he called) Arabicised Mandingo language Allah(u) Ka(w)eia meaning \"Allah Creates All\" as a favourable motto of reflection for Bilal Ibn Rabah, one of the most trusted and loyal Sahabah (companions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, whom he described (quoting William Muir's book The Life of Muhammad) as 'a tall, dark, and with African feature and bushy hair'[20] pious man who overcame slavery, racism and socio-political obstacles in Arabia to achieve a lofty status in this world and in the Hereafter.[21][incomprehensible][relevant? \u2013 discuss]\nDuring the height of Sundiata's power, the land of Manden (the area populated by the Mandinka people) became one of its provinces.[23] The Manden city-state of Ka-ba (present-day Kangaba) served as the capital and name of this province. From at least the beginning of the 11th century, Mandinka kings known as faamas ruled Manden from Ka-ba in the name of the Ghanas.[24]\nWagadou's control over Manden came to a halt after internal instability lead to its decline.[25] The Kangaba province, free of Sonink\u00c3\u00a9 influence, splintered into twelve kingdoms with their own maghan (meaning prince) or faama.[26] Manden was split in half with the Dodougou territory to the northeast and the Kri territory to the southwest.[27] The tiny kingdom of Niani was one of several in the Kri area of Manden.\nIn approximately 1140 the Sosso kingdom of Kaniaga, a former vassal of Wagadou, began conquering the lands of its old masters. By 1180 it had even subjugated Wagadou forcing the Sonink\u00e9 to pay tribute. In 1203, the Sosso king Soumaoro of the Kant\u00e9 clan came to power and reportedly terrorised much of Manden stealing women and goods from both Dodougou and Kri.[28]\nAccording to Niane's version of the epic, during the rise of Kaniaga, Sundiata of the Keita clan was born in the early 13th century. He was the son of Niani's faama, Nare Fa (also known as Maghan Kon Fatta meaning the handsome prince). Sundiata's mother was Maghan Kon Fatta's second wife, Sogolon K\u00c3\u00a9djou.[17] She was a hunchback from the land of Do, south of Mali. The child of this marriage received the first name of his mother (Sogolon) and the surname of his father (Djata). Combined in the rapidly spoken language of the Mandinka, the names formed Sondjata, Sundjata or Sundiata Keita.[17] The anglicised version of this name, Sunjata, is also popular. In Ibn Khaldun's account, Sundjata is recorded as Mari Djata with \"Mari\" meaning \"Amir\" or \"Prince\". He also states that Djata or \"Jatah\" means \"lion\".[29]\nPrince Sundjata was prophesied to become a great conqueror. To his parent's dread, the prince did not have a promising start. Sundiata, according to the oral traditions, did not walk until he was seven years old.[26] However, once Sundiata did gain use of his legs he grew strong and very respected. Sadly for Sundjata, this did not occur before his father died. Despite the faama of Niani's wishes to respect the prophecy and put Sundiata on the throne, the son from his first wife Sassouma B\u00e9r\u00e9t\u00e9 was crowned instead. As soon as Sassouma's son Dankaran Touman took the throne, he and his mother forced the increasingly popular Sundjata into exile along with his mother and two sisters. Before Dankaran Touman and his mother could enjoy their unimpeded power, King Soumaoro set his sights on Niani forcing Dankaran to flee to Kissidougou.[17]\nAfter many years in exile, first at the court of Wagadou and then at Mema, Sundiata was sought out by a Niani delegation and begged to combat the Sosso and free the kingdoms of Manden forever.\nReturning with the combined armies of Mema, Wagadou and all the rebellious Mandinka city-states, Maghan Sundiata or Sumanguru led a revolt against the Kaniaga Kingdom around 1234.[citation needed] The combined forces of northern and southern Manden defeated the Sosso army at the Battle of Kirina (then known as Krina) in approximately 1235.[30] This victory resulted in the fall of the Kaniaga kingdom and the rise of the Mali Empire. After the victory, King Soumaoro disappeared, and the Mandinka stormed the last of the Sosso cities. Maghan Sundiata was declared \"faama of faamas\" and received the title \"mansa\", which translates roughly to emperor. At the age of 18, he gained authority over all the 12 kingdoms in an alliance known as the Manden Kurufaba. He was crowned under the throne name Sunidata Keita becoming the first Mandinka emperor. And so the name Keita became a clan/family and began its reign.[26]\nThe Manden Kurufaba founded by Mari Djata it was composed of the \"three freely allied states\" of Mali, Mema and Wagadou plus the Twelve Doors of Mali.[17] It is important to remember that Mali, in this sense, strictly refers to the city-state of Niani.\nThe Twelve Doors of Mali were a coalition of conquered or allied territories, mostly within Manden, with sworn allegiance to Sundiata and his descendants. Upon stabbing their spears into the ground before Sundiata's throne, each of the twelve kings relinquished their kingdom to the Keita dynasty.[17] In return for their submission, they became \"farbas\", a combination of the Mandinka words \"farin\" and \"ba\" (great farin).[31] Farin was a general term for northern commander at the time. These farbas would rule their old kingdoms in the name of the mansa with most of the authority they held prior to joining the Manden Kurufaba.\nThe Gbara or Great Assembly would serve as the Mandinka deliberative body until the collapse of the Manden Kurufa in 1645. Its first meeting, at the famous Kouroukan Fouga (Division of the World), had 29 clan delegates presided over by a belen-tigui (master of ceremony). The final incarnation of the Gbara, according to the surviving traditions of northern Guinea, held 32 positions occupied by 28 clans.[32]\nThe Kouroukan Fouga also put in place social and economic reforms including prohibitions on the maltreatment of prisoners and slaves, installing documents between clans which clearly stated who could say what about whom. Also, Sundiata divided the lands amongst the people assuring everyone had a place in the empire and fixed exchange rates for common products[citation needed].\nMansa Mari Djata, later named Sundiata Keita, saw the conquest of several key locals in the Mali Empire. He never took the field again after Kirina, but his generals continued to expand the frontier, especially in the west where they reached the Gambia River and the marches of Tekrur. This enabled him to rule over a realm larger than even the Ghana Empire in its apex.[30] When the campaigning was done, his empire extended 1,000 miles (1,600\u00c2\u00a0km) east to west with those borders being the bends of the Senegal and Niger rivers respectively.[33] After unifying Manden, he added the Wangara goldfields, making them the southern border. The northern commercial towns of Oualata and Audaghost were also conquered and became part of the new state's northern border. Wagadou and Mema became junior partners in the realm and part of the imperial nucleus. The lands of Bambougou, Jalo (Fouta Djallon), and Kaabu were added into Mali by Fakoli Koroma (Nkurumah in Ghana, Kurumah in the Gambia, Colley in Casamance, Senegal),[26] Fran Kamara (Camara) and Tiramakhan Traore (Tarawelley in the Gambia),[34] respectively Among the many different ethnic groups surrounding Manden were Pulaar speaking groups in Macina, Tekrur and Fouta Djallon.\nImperial Mali is best known through three primary sources: the first is the account of Shihab al-'Umari, written in about 1340 by a geographer-administrator in Mamluk Egypt. His information about the empire came from visiting Malians taking the hajj, or pilgrim's voyage to Mecca. He had first-hand information from several sources, and from a second-hand source, he learned of the visit of Mansa Musa. The second account is that of the traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352. This is the first account of a West African kingdom made directly by an eyewitness; the others are usually second-hand. The third great account is that of Ibn Khaldun, who wrote in the early 15th century. While the accounts are of limited length, they provide a fairly good picture of the empire at its height.\nThe Mali Empire covered a larger area for a longer period of time than any other West African state before or since. What made this possible was the decentralised nature of administration throughout the state. According to Burkinab\u00e9 writer Joseph Ki-Zerbo, the farther a person travelled from Niani, the more decentralised the mansa's power became.[35] Nevertheless, the mansa managed to keep tax money and nominal control over the area without agitating his subjects into revolt. At the local level (village, town and city), kun-tiguis elected a dougou-tigui (village-master) from a bloodline descended from that locality's semi-mythical founder.[36] The county level administrators called kafo-tigui (county-master) were appointed by the governor of the province from within his own circle.[37] Only at the state or province level was there any palpable interference from the central authority in Niani. Provinces picked their own governors via their own custom (election, inheritance, etc.). Regardless of their title in the province, they were recognised as dyamani-tigui (province master) by the mansa.[37] Dyamani-tiguis had to be approved by the mansa and were subject to his oversight. If the mansa didn\u2019t believe the dyamani-tigui was capable or trustworthy, a farba might be installed to oversee the province or administer it outright.\nA manuscript page from Timbuktu\nManuscript of Nasir al-Din Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn al-Hajj al-Amin al-Tawathi al-Ghalawi's Kashf al-Ghummah fi Nafa al-Ummah. From the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library, Timbuktu.\nA manuscript page from Timbuktu showing a table of astronomical information\nTerritories in Mali came into the empire via conquest or annexation. In the event of conquest, farins took control of the area until a suitable native ruler could be found. After the loyalty or at least the capitulation of an area was assured, it was allowed to select its own dyamani-tigui. This process was essential to keep non-Manding subjects loyal to the Manding elites that ruled them.\nBarring any other difficulties, the dyamani-tigui would run the province by himself collecting taxes and procuring armies from the tribes under his command. However, territories that were crucial to trade or subject to revolt would receive a farba.[38] Farbas were picked by the mansa from the conquering farin or family members. The only real requirement was that the mansa knew he could trust this individual to safeguard imperial interests.\nDuties of the farba included reporting on the activities of the territory, collecting taxes and ensuring the native administration didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contradict orders from Niani. The farba could also take power away from the native administration if required and raise an army in the area for defence or putting down rebellions.[38]\nThe post of a farba was very prestigious, and his descendants could inherit it with the mansa's approval. The mansa could also replace a farba if he got out of control, as in the case of Diafunu.\nThe Mali Empire reached its largest size under the Laye Keita mansas. Al-Umari, who wrote down a description of Mali based on information given to him by Abu Sa\u2019id \u2018Otman ed Dukkali (who had lived 35 years in Niani), reported the realm as being square and an eight-month journey from its coast at Tura (at the mouth of the Senegal River) to Muli (also known as Tuhfat). Umari also describes the empire as being south of Marrakesh and almost entirely inhabited except for few places. Mali's domain also extended into the desert. He describes it as being north of Mali but under its domination implying some sort of vassalage for the Antasar, Yantar'ras, Medussa and Lemtuna Berber tribes.[39] The empire's total area included nearly all the land between the Sahara Desert and coastal forests. It spanned the modern-day countries of Senegal, southern Mauritania, Mali, northern Burkina Faso, western Niger, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, the Ivory Coast and northern Ghana. By 1350, the empire covered approximately 439,400 square miles (1,138,000\u00a0km2). The empire also reached its highest population during the Laye period ruling over 400 cities,[40] towns and villages of various religions and elasticities. During this period only the Mongol Empire was larger.\nThe dramatic increase in the empire's size demanded a shift from the Manden Kurufaba's organisation of three states with twelve dependencies. This model was scrapped by the time of Mansa Musa's hajj to Egypt. According to al'Umari, who interviewed a Berber that had lived in Niani for 35 years, there were fourteen provinces (or, more accurately, tributary kingdoms). In al-'Umari's record, he only records the following thirteen provinces and five states.[41]\nIn 1307 Mansa Musa came to the throne after a series of civil wars and ruled for thirty years. During the peak of the kingdom, Mali was extremely wealthy. This was due to the tax on trade in and out of the empire, along with all the gold Mansa Musa had. He had so much gold that during his hajj to Mecca, the Mansa passed out gold to all the poor along the way. This led to inflation throughout the kingdom. Mansa Musa also ran out of gold on the hajj to Mecca but was not concerned because he knew he had enough gold back in Mali to pay back everything he owed money to. Trade was a significant factor to the rise and success of Mali. Mali flourished especially when Timbuktu came under Mansa Musa\u2019s control. Timbuktu was a place of trade, entertainment, and education. The city\u2019s water supply was a leading cause to its successes in trade.[44] Mansa Musa placed a heavy tax on all objects that went through Timbuktu. Although this time in the kingdom was prosperous, Mali\u2019s wealth and power soon declined. Mali was thriving for a long time, but like other western pre-colonial kingdom, Mali began to fall. Constant civil war between leaders led to a weakened state. These conflicts also interrupted trade. This is one of the main factors to the fall of the kingdom. Trade was Mali\u2019s form of income, and wealth. With trade being disrupted by wars, there was no way for the economy to continue to prosper. As a result of this the empire fell. [45]\nThe Mali Empire flourished because of its trade above all else. It contained three immense gold mines within its borders unlike the Ghana Empire, which was only a transit point for gold. The empire taxed every ounce of gold, copper and salt that entered its borders. By the beginning of the 14th century, Mali was the source of almost half the Old World's gold exported from mines in Bambuk, Boure and Galam.[37] Gold mines in Boure, which is located in present-day Guinea, were discovered sometime near the end of 12th century[46]\nThere was no standard currency throughout the realm, but several forms were prominent by region. The Sahelian and Saharan towns of the Mali Empire were organised as both staging posts in the long-distance caravan trade and trading centres for the various West African products. At Taghaza, for example, salt was exchanged; at Takedda, copper. Ibn Battuta observed the employment of servants in both towns. During most of his journey, Ibn Battuta travelled with a retinue that included servants, most of whom carried goods for trade. On the return from Takedda to Morocco, his caravan transported 600 female servants, suggesting that indentured servitude was a substantial part of the commercial activity of the empire.[47]\nGold nuggets were the exclusive property of the mansa, and were illegal to trade within his borders. All gold was immediately handed over to the imperial treasury in return for an equal value of gold dust. Gold dust had been weighed and bagged for use at least since the time of the Ghana Empire. Mali borrowed the practice to stem inflation of the substance, since it was so prominent in the region. The most common measure for gold within the realm was the ambiguous mithqal (4.5\u00c2\u00a0grams of gold).[26] This term was used interchangeably with dinar, though it is unclear if coined currency was used in the empire. Gold dust was used all over the empire, but was not valued equally in all regions.\nThe next great unit of exchange in the Mali Empire was salt. Salt was as valuable, if not more valuable, than gold in sub-Saharan Africa. It was cut into pieces and spent on goods with close to equal buying power throughout the empire.[48] While it was as good as gold in the north, it was even better in the south. The people of the south needed salt for their diet, but it was extremely rare.[citation needed] The northern region on the other hand had no shortage of salt. Every year merchants entered Mali via Oualata with camel loads of salt to sell in Niani. According to Ibn Battuta who visited Mali in the mid-14th century, one camel load of salt sold at Walata for 8\u201310 mithqals of gold, but in Mali proper it realised 20\u201330 ducats and sometimes even 40.[48] One particular source of salt in the Mali Empire was salt-mining sites located in Taghaza. Ibn Battuta had written that in Taghaza there were no trees and there is only sand and the salt mines. Nobody lived in the area except the Musafa servants who worked to dig the salts and lived on dates imported from Sijilmasa and the Dar'a valley, camel meat and millet imported from the Sudan. The buildings were constructed from slabs of salt and roofed with camel skins. The salt was dug from the ground and cut into thick slabs, two of which were loaded onto each camel where they would be taken south across the desert to Oualata and sold. The value of the salt was chiefly determined by the transport costs. Ibn Battuta mentions that the value of salt increased fourfold when transported between Oualata and the Malian capital.[49]\nCopper was also a valued commodity in imperial Mali. According to the records of Ibn Battuta,[50][51] copper which traded in bars was mined from Takedda in the north and traded in the south for gold. Contemporary sources claim 60 copper bars traded for 100 dinars of gold.[26]\nThe number and frequency of conquests in the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century indicate the Kolonkan mansas inherited and or developed a capable military. Sundjata is credited with at least the initial organisation of the Manding military. However, it went through radical changes before reaching the legendary proportions proclaimed by its subjects. As a result of steady tax revenue and stable government beginning in the last quarter of the 13th century, the Mali Empire was able to project its power throughout its own extensive domain and beyond.\nThe Mali Empire maintained a semi-professional, full-time army in order to defend its borders. The entire nation was mobilised, with each clan obligated to provide a quota of fighting-age men.[26] These men had to be of the horon (freemen) caste and appear with their own arms. Historians who lived during the height and decline of the Mali Empire consistently record its army at 100,000, with 10,000 of that number being made up of cavalry.[26] With the help of the river clans, this army could be deployed throughout the realm on short notice.[52][53] Numerous sources attest that the inland waterways of West Africa saw extensive use of war canoes and vessels used for war transport where permitted by the environment. Most West African canoes were of single-log construction, carved and dug out from one massive tree trunk.[54]\nThe army of the Mali Empire during the 14th century was divided into northern and southern commands led by the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma, respectively.[26] Both of these men were part of Mali's warrior elite known as the ton-ta-jon-ta-ni-woro (\"sixteen slave carriers of quiver\"). Each representative or ton-tigi (\"quiver-master\") provided council to the mansa at the Gbara, but only these two ton-tigi held such wide-ranging power.\nThe ton-tigi belonged to an elite force of cavalry commanders called the farari (\"brave men\"). Each individual farariya (\"brave\") had a number of infantry officers beneath them called k\u00e8l\u00e8-koun or d\u00f9\u00f9k\u00f9n\u00e0si. A k\u00e8l\u00e8-koun led free troops into battle alongside a farima (\"brave man\") during campaign. A d\u00f9\u00f9k\u00f9n\u00e0si performed the same function except with slave troops called sofa (\"guardian of the horse\") and under the command of a farimba (\"great brave man\"). The farimba operated from a garrison with an almost entirely slave force, while a farima functioned on field with virtually all freemen.\nThe army of the Mali Empire used of a wide variety of weapons depending largely on where the troops originated. Only sofa were equipped by the state, using bows and poisoned arrows. Free warriors from the north (Mandekalu or otherwise) were usually equipped with large reed or animal hide shields and a stabbing spear that was called a tamba. Free warriors from the south came armed with bows and poisonous arrows. The bow figured prominently in Mandinka warfare and was a symbol of military force throughout the culture. Bowmen formed a large portion of the field army as well as the garrison. Three bowmen supporting one spearman was the ratio in Kaabu and the Gambia by the mid-16th century. Equipped with two quivers and a knife fastened to the back of their arm, Mandinka bowmen used barbed, iron-tipped arrows that were usually poisoned. They also used flaming arrows for siege warfare. While spears and bows were the mainstay of the infantry, swords and lances of local or foreign manufacture were the choice weapons of the cavalry. Ibn Battuta comments on festival demonstrations of swordplay before the mansa by his retainers including the royal interpreter.[55] Another common weapon of Mandekalu warriors was the poison javelin used in skirmishes. Imperial Mali's horsemen also used mail armour for defence and shields similar to those of the infantry.\nImperial Malian architecture was characterised by Sudano-Sahelian architecture with a Malian substyle, which is exemplified by the Great Mosque of Djenne. This style is characterised by the use of mudbricks and an adobe plaster, with large wooden-log support beams that jut out from the wall face for large buildings such as mosques or palaces.\nThe dating of the Great Mosque's construction is obscure. The earliest document mentioning the mosque is Abd al-Sadi's Tarikh al-Sudan, which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid seventeenth century. The tarikh states that a Sultan Kunburu became a Muslim and had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque; he then built another palace for himself near the mosque on the east side.[56][57]\nThe Sudano-Sahelian influence was particularly widely incorporated during the rule of Mansa Musa I, who constructed many architectural projects, including the Great Mosque of Gao and Royal Palace in Timbuktu, which was built with the assistance of Ishaak al-Tuedjin, an architect brought by Musa from his pilgrimage to Mecca.[58]\nThere were 21 known mansas of the Mali Empire after Mari Djata I, and probably about two or three more yet to be revealed. The names of these rulers come down through history via the djelis and modern descendants of the Keita dynasty residing in Kangaba. What separates these rulers from the founder, other than the latter's historic role in establishing the state, is their transformation of the Manden Kurufaba into a Manden Empire. Not content to rule fellow Manding subjects unified by the victory of Mari Djata I, these mansas would conquer and annex Fula,[59] Wolof, Bamana, Songhai, Tuareg and countless other peoples into an immense empire.\nThe first three successors to Mari Djata/Sundiata Keita all claimed it by blood right or something similar. This twenty-five year period saw large gains for the mansa and the beginning of fierce internal rivalries that nearly ended the burgeoning empire.\nAfter Sundiata's death in 1255, custom dictated that his son ascend the throne, assuming he was of age. However, Y\u00e9r\u00e9linkon was a minor following his father's death.[32] Manding Bory Keita, Sundiata's half-brother and kankoro-sigui (vizier), should have been crowned according to the Kouroukan Fouga. Instead, Mari Djata's son seized the throne and was crowned Mansa Ouali Keita (also spelt \"Wali\" or \"Ali\").[60]\nMansa Ouali Keita proved to be an efficient emperor, adding more lands to the empire, including the Gambian provinces of Bati and Casa. He also conquered the gold producing provinces of Bambuk and Bondou. The central province of Konkodougou was established. The Songhai kingdom of Gao also seems to have been subjugated for the first of many times around this period.[37]\nAside from military conquest, Ouali is also credited with agricultural reforms throughout the empire putting many soldiers to work as farmers in the newly acquired Gambian provinces. Just prior to his death in 1270, Ouali went on the hajj to Mecca during the reign of Mamluk Sultan Baibars, according to Ibn Khaldun.[60] This helped in strengthening ties with North Africa and Muslim merchants.[37]\nAs a policy of controlling and rewarding his generals, Mari Djata adopted their sons.[26] These children were raised at the mansa's court and became Keitas upon reaching maturity. Seeing the throne as their right, two adopted sons of Mari Djata waged a devastating war against one another that threatened to destroy what the first two mansas had built. The first son to gain the throne was Mansa Ouati Keita (also spelt Wati) in 1270.[61] He reigned for four years, spending lavishly and ruling cruelly, according to the djelis. Upon his death in 1274, the other adopted son seized the throne.[61] Mansa Khalifa Keita is remembered as even worse than Ouati Keita. According to the djelis, he governed just as badly, was insane and fired arrows from the roof of his palace at passers by. Ibn Khaldun recounts that the people rushed upon him and killed him during a popular revolt.[60] The Gbara replaced him with Manding Bory Keita in 1275.[62]\nAfter the chaos of Ouati Keita and Khalifa Keita's reigns, a number of court officials with close ties to Sundiata Keita ruled. They began the empire's return to stability, setting it up for a golden age of rulers.\nManding Bory was crowned under the throne name Mansa Abubakari (a Manding corruption of the Muslim name Abu Bakr).[26] Mansa Abubakari's mother was Namandj\u00c3\u00a9,[26] the third wife of Maghan Kon Fatta. Prior to becoming mansa, Abubakari had been one of his brother's generals and later his kankoro-sigui. Little else is known about the reign of Abubakari I, but it seems he was successful in stopping the hemorrhaging of wealth in the empire.\nIn 1285, a court slave freed by Sundiata Keita, and who had also served as a general, usurped the throne of Mali.[37] The reign of Mansa Sakoura (also spelt Sakura) appears to have been beneficial, despite the political shake-up. He added the first conquests to Mali since the reign of Ouali, including the former Wagadou provinces of Tekrour and Diara. His conquests did not stop at the boundaries of Wagadou, however. He campaigned into Senegal and conquered the Wolof province of Dyolof (Jolof), then took the army east to subjugate the copper-producing area of Takedda. He also conquered Macina and raided into Gao to suppress its first rebellion against Mali.[37] More than just a mere warrior, Mansa Sakoura went on the hajj during the reign of Al-Nasir Muhammad.[60] Mansa Sakura also opened direct trade negotiations with Tripoli and Morocco.[37]\nAccording to one account, Sakoura was murdered on his return trip from Mecca in or near present-day Djibouti by a Danakil warrior attempting to rob him.[63] The emperor's attendants rushed his body home through the Ouaddai region and into Kanem where one of that empire's messengers was sent to Mali with news of Sakoura's death. When the body arrived in Niani, it was given a regal burial despite the usurper's slave roots.[63]\nThe Gbara selected Ko Mamadi Keita as the next mansa in 1300. He was the first of a new line of rulers directly descending from Sundiata Keita's sister, Kolonkan Keita.[26] But, seeing as how these rulers all shared the blood of Maghan Kon Fatta, they are considered legitimate Keitas. Even Sakoura, with his history of being a slave in the Keita family, was considered a Keita; so the line of Bilal had yet to be broken.\nIt is during the Kolonkan Keita lineage that the defining characteristics of golden age Mali begin to appear. By maintaining the developments of Sakoura and Abubakari Keita I, the Kolonkan Keita mansas steered Mali safely into its apex.\nKo Mamadi Keita was crowned Mansa Gao Keita and ruled over a successful empire without any recorded crises. His son, Mansa Mohammed ibn Gao Keita, ascended the throne five years later and continued the stability of the Kolonkan Keita line.[26]\nThe last Kolonkan ruler, Bata Manding Bory Keita, was crowned Mansa Abubakari Keita II in 1310.[26] He continued the non-militant style of rule that characterised Gao and Mohammed ibn Gao Keita, but was interested in the empire's western sea. According to an account given by Mansa Musa Keita I, who during the reign of Abubakari Keita II served as the mansa's kankoro-sigui, Mali sent two expeditions into the Atlantic Ocean. Mansa Abubakari Keita II left Musa Keita as regent of the empire, demonstrating the stability of this period in Mali, and departed with the second expedition, commanding some 2,000 ships equipped with both oars and sails in 1311.[64] Neither the emperor nor any of the ships returned to Mali. Modern historians and scientists are sceptical about the success of either voyage, but the account of these happenings is preserved in both written North African records and the oral records of Mali's djelis.\nAbubakari Keita II's 1312 abdication, the only recorded one in the empire's history, marked the beginning of a new lineage descended from Faga Laye Keita.[26] Faga Laye Keita was the son of Abubakari Keita I. Unlike his father, Faga Laye Keita never took the throne of Mali. However, his line would produce seven mansas who reigned during the height of Mali's power and toward the beginning of its decline.\nThe first ruler from the Laye lineage was Kankan Musa Keita (or Moussa), also known as Mansa Musa. After an entire year without word from Abubakari Keita II, he was crowned Mansa Musa Keita. Mansa Musa Keita was one of the first truly devout Muslims to lead the Mali Empire. He attempted to make Islam the faith of the nobility,[37] but kept to the imperial tradition of not forcing it on the populace. He also made Eid celebrations at the end of Ramadan a national ceremony. He could read and write Arabic and took an interest in the scholarly city of Timbuktu, which he peaceably annexed in 1324. Via one of the royal ladies of his court, Musa transformed Sankore from an informal madrasah into an Islamic university. Islamic studies flourished thereafter.\nMansa Musa Keita's crowning achievement was his famous pilgrimage to Mecca, which started in 1324 and concluded with his return in 1326. Accounts of how many people and how much gold he spent vary. All of them agree that he took a very large group of people; the mansa kept a personal guard of some 500 men,[65] and he gave out so many alms and bought so many things that the value of gold in Egypt and Arabia depreciated for twelve years.[66] When he passed through Cairo, historian al-Maqrizi noted \"the members of his entourage proceeded to buy Turkish and Ethiopian slave girls, singing girls and garments, so that the rate of the gold dinar fell by six dirhams.\"\nAnother testimony from Ibn Khaldun describes the grand pilgrimage of Mansa Musa consisting of 12,000 slaves:\n\"He made a pilgrimage in 724/1324 [...]. At each halt, he would regale us [his entourage] rare foods and confectionery. His equipment furnishings were carried by 12.000 private slave women (Wasaif) wearing gown and brocade (dibaj) and Yemeni silk [...]. Mansa Musa came from his country with 80 loads of gold dust (tibr), each load weighing three qintars. In their own country they use only slave women and men for transport, but for long journeys such as pilgrimages they have mounts.\"[67]\nContemporary sources suggest that the mounts employed by this caravan were one hundred elephants, which carried those loads of gold, and several hundred camels, carrying the food, supplies and weaponries which were brought to the rear.[68]\nMusa took out large loans from money lenders in Cairo before beginning his journey home. It is not known if this was an attempt to correct the depreciation of gold in the area due to his spending,[69] or if he had simply run out of the funds needed for the return trip.[70] Musa's hajj, and especially his gold, caught the attention of both the Islamic and Christian worlds. Consequently, the name of Mali and Timbuktu appeared on 14th century world maps.\nWhile on the hajj, he met the Andalusian poet and architect es-Saheli. Mansa Musa brought the architect back to Mali to beautify some of the cities. But more reasoned analysis suggests that his role, if any, was quite limited. The architectural crafts in Granada had reached their zenith by the fourteenth century, and its extremely unlikely that a cultured and wealthy poet would have had anything more than a dilettante's knowledge of the intricacies of contemporary architectural practice.[71] Mosques were built in Gao and Timbuktu along with impressive palaces also built in Timbuktu. By the time of his death in 1337, Mali had control over Taghazza, a salt producing area in the north, which further strengthened its treasury.\nThat same year, after the Mandinka general known as Sagmandir put down yet another rebellion in Gao,[37] Mansa Musa came to Gao and accepted the capitulation of the King of Ghana and his nobles. This included Ali Killun/Kolon and his brother Selmar Nar from the Za Dynasty, whom would later be appointed as page of the court of Mali around 1335.[72]\nBy the end of Mansa Musa's reign, the Sankor\u00e9 University had been converted into a fully staffed university with the largest collections of books in Africa since the Library of Alexandria. The Sankor\u00e9 University was capable of housing 25,000 students and had one of the largest libraries in the world with roughly 1,000,000 manuscripts.[73][74]\nMansa Musa Keita was succeeded by his son, Maghan Keita I, in 1337.[37] Mansa Maghan Keita I spent wastefully and was the first lacklustre emperor since Khalifa Keita. But the Mali Empire built by his predecessors was too strong for even his misrule and it passed intact to Musa's brother, Souleyman Keita in 1341.\nMansa Souleyman Keita (or Suleiman) took steep measures to put Mali back into financial shape, thereby developing a reputation for miserliness.[37] However, he proved to be a good and strong ruler despite numerous challenges. It is during his reign that Fula raids on Takrur began. There was also a palace conspiracy to overthrow him hatched by the Qasa (the Manding term meaning Queen) and several army commanders.[37] Mansa Souleyman's generals successfully fought off the military incursions, and the senior wife behind the plot was imprisoned.\nThe mansa also made a successful hajj, kept up correspondence with Morocco and Egypt and built an earthen platform at Kangaba called the Camanbolon where he held court with provincial governors and deposited the holy books he brought back from Hedjaz.\nThe only major setback to his reign was the loss of Mali's Dyolof province in Senegal. The Wolof populations of the area united into their own state known as the Jolof Empire in the 1350s. Still, when Ibn Battuta arrived at Mali in July 1352, he found a thriving civilisation on par with virtually anything in the Muslim or Christian world. Mansa Souleyman Keita died in 1360 and was succeeded by his son, Camba Keita.\nThe North African traveller and scholar Ibn Battuta visited the area in 1352 and, according to a 1929 English translation, said this about its inhabitants:\n\"The negroes possess some admirable qualities. They are seldom unjust, and have a greater abhorrence of injustice\nthan any other people. There is complete security in their country. Neither traveller nor inhabitant in it has anything to fear from robbers or men of violence.\"[75]\nThe Travels of Ibn Battuta\nAbu Abdallah Ibn Battuta was born in Morocco in the year 1304. Years later during his mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca as a Muslim and a qadi (Muslim judge), he decided that what he wished to do most was travel to and beyond every part of the Muslim world. Upon this realization, Ibn made a personal vow to \u2018never travel any road a second time.\u201d He began on his long and eventful journey, making many stops along the way. It was in Cairo, Egypt, that he first heard of the great ruler of Mali- Mansa Musa. A few years prior to Battuta's visit, Mansa Musa had passed through Cairo as well on his own pilgrimage to Mecca. He had brought with him a large entourage of slaves, soldiers and wives, along with over a thousand pounds of gold. With this he 'flooded' Cairo to the point of disrupting the entire gold market for decades to come. Aside from gold Mali traded many other lavish resources and its riches were spoke of widely, along with encouraging Islam across Africa. It it no doubt that even after his long and tiring travels, a curious Ibn Battuta would saddle up again to make the long journey across the Sahara (1,500 miles) and into the Kingdom of Mali. After entering the country and staying for eight long months, Ibn left with mixed feelings. At first his impressions were not good- as a meal he was offered a bowl of millet with honey an yogurt. Seeing this as offensive, he wished to leave as soon as possible. During his stay he was also fed rice, milk, fish, chicken, melons, pumpkins and yams (that would end up making him very ill). From the King, he was gifted three loaves of bread, a gourd full of yogurt, and a piece of beef fried in shea butter. He was insulted by this as well, feeling that the gift was inadequate for him.\"When I saw it I laughed, and was long astonished at their feeble intellect and their respect for mean things.\" He was also taken aback by the local customs regarding the sexes. In his mind, man and woman should be separate in an Islamic society. Here the sexes were friends, spent time with one another and were agreeable. Upon his disapproval he was told that their relations were a part of good manners, and that there would be no suspicion attached to it. To his surprise, female servants and slaves also often went completely nude in front of the court to see, which would not have been acceptable as a Muslim- or any kind of- woman. They wore no veil and crawled on their hands and knees, throwing dust over themselves when approaching their ruler, Mansa Sulayman. Mansa Sulayman was the younger brother of Mansa Musa who took reign after he died. The public ceremony he attended was strange to him but grand, as he observed from the audience. \"[The sultan] has a lofty pavilion ... where he sits most of the time... There came forth from the gate of the palace about 300 slaves, some carrying in their hands bows and others having in their hands short lances and shields... Then two saddled and bridled horses are brought, with two rams which, they say, are effective against the evil eye... The interpreter stands at the gate of the council-place wearing fine garments of silk... and on his head a turban with fringes which they have a novel way of winding... The troops, governors, young men, slaves, ... and others sit outside the council-place in a broad street where there are trees... Anyone who wishes to address the sultan addresses the interpreter and the interpreter addresses a man standing [near the sultan] and that man standing addresses the sultan\". \u00a0While he had his grievances, there were parts of Mali that Ibn Battuta found to be exceptional. For one, the safety in the streets of Mali went unmatched. The city was very secure with many guards and it was said that no man walked afraid in the streets of Mali. The people also held justice to a very high standard and that was notable for Ibn. Most importantly, he was impressed with the peoples devotion to Islam. There were mosques there that people visited regularly, and they always prayed on Friday, the holy prayer day established by Mansa Musa for Muslims. The citizens wished to learn more about the islamic faith and seemed to be very involved with the teaching of the Quran. Although many had converted and had a zeal for Islam, there were many common people who still held on to their traditional african religions. Mansa Sulayman had to appease these people as well, which is something that Ibn may not have considered and viewed as an insult to Islam. In the end, Sulayman attempted to appease him by giving him a house to stay at and an allowance as well. Upon his departure, Ibn left with 100 mithqals of gold and diverse feelings towards the kingdom of Mali.\nWhere the empire of Mali reigned covered the modern day areas of Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea, along with small regions of the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Niger. For the most part Mali is covered, with the rest just having areas of the ancient empire cross into their borders. After a series of unsuccessful successions and exchanges of power and changes of ruler, the Empire of Mali was weakened greatly. As a result of these issues a civil war erupted upon the Kingdom which further incapacitated old Mali. Because of the war going on, trade was disrupted. Trade was a huge reason that the empire was thriving economically, and so its disruption led to a direct collapse of the empire entirely. For the sake of convenience, the modern day Mali will be explored instead of including every single area where the empire stretched, since it remained primarily in this region and hence had the most influence on it. Mali is one of the biggest countries in Africa, landlocked in West Africa. It still holds the major trade hub city of Timbuktu, but some of its previous greatness had faded with time and conflicts. The country obtained independence from France in 1960 but continued to face many other hardships, including almost a quarter century of dictatorship, before gaining the right to vote in the democratic election of 1992. Since then, there was been many incidents that do not paint this country as a descendant of the once great and powerful empire. The people have suffered through drought and starvation, as well as the very present risk of terrorism and jihadist attacks. In more recent years, the government of Mali struggled with nationalist rebels known as the Tuareg. French soldiers were then brought in to Mali in order to capture towns that were held by rebels. With their help, the Malian government was able to regain control of northern Mali in 2013, which is the same year Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was democratically voted and sworn in as President. There does, however, continue to be conflict to this day. As recent as January of 2018, some 14 soldiers and almost 30 civilians are killed at the hands of an ongoing battle. Current day Mali is certainly not a model of what Ibn Battuta experienced upon visiting its great Kingdom. Had he seen it now, he might not have been so concerned with the food he was given.[76]\nAfter a mere nine months of rule, Mansa Camba Keita was deposed by one of Maghan Keita I's three sons. Konkodougou Kamissa Keita, named for the province he once governed,[26] was crowned as Mansa Mari Djata Keita II in 1360. He ruled oppressively and nearly bankrupted Mali with his lavish spending. He did however, maintain contacts with Morocco, sending a giraffe to King Abu Hassan. Mansa Mari Djata Keita II became seriously ill in 1372,[37] and power moved into the hands of his ministers until his death in 1374.\nThe reign of Mari Djata Keita II was ruinous and left the empire in bad financial shape, but the empire itself passed intact to the dead emperor's brother. Mansa Fadima Musa Keita, or Mansa Musa Keita II, began the process of reversing his brother's excesses.[37] He did not, however, hold the power of previous mansas because of the influence of his kankoro-sigui.\nKankoro-sigui Mari Djata, who had no relation to the Keita clan, essentially ran the empire in Musa Keita II's stead. Ibn Khaldun recorded that in 776 A.H or 1374/1375 AD he interviewed a Sijilmasan scholar named Muhammad b. Wasul who had lived in Gao and had been employed in its judiciary. The latter told Ibn Khaldun about devastating struggle over Gao between Mali imperial forces against Berber Tuareg forces from Takedda.[77] The text of Ibn Khaldun says \"Gao, at this time is devastated\".[77] It seems quite possible that an exodus of the inhabitants took place at this juncture and the importance of the city was not revived until the rise of the Songhai empire.[77]\nThe Songhai settlement effectively shook off Mali's authority in 1375. Still, by the time of Mansa Musa Keita II's death in 1387, Mali was financially solvent and in control of all of its previous conquests short of Gao and Dyolof. Forty years after the reign of Mansa Musa Keita I, the Mali Empire still controlled some 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land throughout Western Africa.[78][9]\nThe last son of Maghan Keita I, Tenin Maghan Keita (also known as Kita Tenin Maghan Keita for the province he once governed) was crowned Mansa Maghan Keita II in 1387.[26] Little is known of him except that he only reigned two years. He was deposed in 1389, marking the end of the Faga Laye Keita mansas.\nFrom 1389 onwards Mali gained a host of mansas of obscure origins. This is the least known period in Mali's imperial history. What is evident is that there is no steady lineage governing the empire. The other characteristic of this era is the gradual loss of its northern and eastern possessions to the rising Songhai Empire and the movement of the Mali's economic focus from the trans-Saharan trade routes to the burgeoning commerce along the coast.\nMansa Sandaki Keita, a descendant of kankoro-sigui Mari Djata Keita, deposed Maghan Keita II, becoming the first person without any Keita dynastic relation to officially rule Mali.[37] Sandaki Keita should not however be taken to be this person's name but a title. Sandaki likely means High Counsellor or Supreme Counsellor, from san or sanon (meaning \"high\") and adegue (meaning counsellor).[79] He would only reign a year before a descendant of Mansa Gao Keita removed him.[80]\nMahmud Keita, possibly a grandchild or great-grandchild of Mansa Gao Keita, was crowned Mansa Maghan Keita III in 1390. During his reign, the Mossi emperor Bonga of Yatenga raided into Mali and plundered Macina.[37] Emperor Bonga did not appear to hold the area, and it stayed within the Mali Empire after Maghan Keita III's death in 1400.\nIn the early 15th century, Mali was still powerful enough to conquer and settle new areas. One of these was Dioma, an area south of Niani populated by Fula Wassoulounk\u00e9.[26] Two noble brothers from Niani, of unknown lineage, went to Dioma with an army and drove out the Fula Wassoulounk\u00e9. The oldest brother, S\u00e9r\u00e9bandjougou Keita, was crowned Mansa Foamed or Mansa Musa Keita III. His reign saw the first in a string of many great losses to Mali. In 1430, the Tuareg seized Timbuktu.[81] Three years later, Oualata also fell into their hands.[37]\nFollowing Musa Keita III's death, his brother Gb\u00e8r\u00e9 Keita became emperor in the mid-15th century.[26] Gb\u00e8r\u00e9 Keita was crowned Mansa Ouali Keita II and ruled during the period of Mali's contact with Portugal. In the 1450s, Portugal began sending raiding parties along the Gambian coast.[82] The Gambia was still firmly in Mali's control, and these raiding expeditions met with disastrous fates before Portugal's Diogo Gomes began formal relations with Mali via its remaining Wolof subjects.[83] Alvise Cadamosto, a Venetian explorer, recorded that the Mali Empire was the most powerful entity on the coast in 1454.[83]\nDespite their power in the west, Mali was losing the battle for supremacy in the north and northeast. The new Songhai Empire conquered Mema,[37] one of Mali's oldest possessions, in 1465. It then seized Timbuktu from the Tuareg in 1468 under Sunni Ali Ber.[37]\nIn 1477, the Yatenga emperor Nass\u00e9r\u00e9 made yet another Mossi raid into Macina, this time conquering it and the old province of BaGhana (Wagadou).[84]\nMansa Mahmud Keita II came to the throne in 1481 during Mali's downward spiral. It is unknown from whom he descended; however, another emperor, Mansa Maghan Keita III, is sometimes cited as Mansa Mahmud Keita I. Still, throne names don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually indicate blood relations. Mansa Mahmud Keita II's rule was characterised by more losses to Mali's old possessions and increased contact between Mali and Portuguese explorers along the coast. In 1481, Fula raids against Mali's Tekrur provinces began.\nThe growing trade in Mali's western provinces with Portugal witnessed the exchange of envoys between the two nations. Mansa Mahmud Keita II received the Portuguese envoys P\u00earo d'\u00c9vora and Gon\u00e7alo Enes in 1487.[26] The mansa lost control of Jalo during this period.[85] Meanwhile, Songhai seized the salt mines of Taghazza in 1493. That same year, Mahmud II sent another envoy to the Portuguese proposing alliance against the Fula. The Portuguese decided to stay out of the conflict and the talks concluded by 1495 without an alliance.[85]\nThe last mansa to rule from Niani is Mansa Mahmud Keita III, also known as Mansa Mamadou Keita II. He came to power around 1496 and has the dubious honour of being the mansa under which Mali suffered the most losses to its territory.\nSonghai forces under the command of Askia Muhammad I defeated the Mali general Fati Quali Keita in 1502 and seized the province of Diafunu.[37] In 1514, the Denianke dynasty was established in Tekrour. It wasn't long before the new kingdom of Great Fulo was warring against Mali's remaining provinces. Additionally, the Songhai Empire seized the copper mines of Takedda.\nIn 1534, Mahmud Keita III received another Portuguese envoy to the Mali court by the name of Pero Fernandes.[86] This envoy from the Portuguese coastal port of Elmina arrived in response to the growing trade along the coast and Mali's now urgent request for military assistance against Songhai.[87] Still, no help came from the envoy and further possessions of Mali were lost one by one.\nMansa Mahmud Keita III's reign also saw the military outpost and province of Kaabu become independent in 1537.[85] The Kaabu Empire appears as ambitions as Mali was in its early years and conquers Mali's remaining Gambian provinces of Cassa and Bati.[88]\nThe most defining moment in Mahmud Keita III's reign is arguably the final conflict between Mali and Songhai in 1545. Songhai forces under Askia Ishaq's brother, Daoud, sack Niani and occupy the palace.[89] Mansa Mahmud Keita III is forced to flee Niani for the mountains. Within a week, he regroups with his forces and launches a successful counter-attack forcing the Songhai out of Manden proper for good.[90] The Songhai Empire keeps Mali's ambitions in check, but never fully conquers the empire, their former masters.\nAfter liberating the capital, Mahmud Keita II abandons it for a new residence further north.[90] Still, there is no end to Mali's troubles. In 1559, the kingdom of Fouta Tooro succeeds in taking Takrur.[85] This defeat reduces Mali to Manden proper with control extending only as far as Kita in the west, Kangaba in the north, the Niger River bend in the east and Kouroussa in the south.\nMansa Mahmud III's reign ended around 1559. There seems to have been either a vacancy or unknown ruler between 1559 and the start of the last mansa's reign. A vacancy or rule by a court official seems the most likely, since the next ruler takes the name of Mahmud IV. By 1560, the once powerful empire was not much more than the core of the Manden Kurufaba. The next notable mansa, Mahmud IV, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear in any records until the end of the 16th century. However, he seems to have the distinction of being the last ruler of a unified Manden. His descendants are blamed for the breakup of the Manden Kurufaba into north, central and southern realms.\nMansa Mahmud Keita IV (also known as Mansa Mamadou Keita II, Mali Mansa Mamadou Keita and Niani Mansa Mamadou Keita) was the last emperor of Manden according to the Tarikh al-Sudan. It states that he launched an attack on the city of Djenn\u00e9 in 1599 with Fulani allies, hoping to take advantage of Songhai's defeat.[91] Moroccan fusiliers, deployed from Timbuktu, met them in battle, exposing Mali to the same technology (firearms) that had destroyed Songhai. Despite heavy losses, the mansa's army was not deterred and nearly carried the day.[91] However, the army inside Djenn\u00e9 intervened, forcing Mansa Mahmud Keita IV and his army to retreat to Kangaba.[87]\nThe mansa's defeat actually won Sundiata Keita the respect of Morocco, and may have saved it from Songhai's fate. It would be the Mandinka themselves that would cause the final destruction of the empire. Around 1610, Mahmud Keita IV died. Oral tradition states that he had three sons who fought over Manden's remains. No single Keita ever ruled Manden after Mahmud Keita IV's death, resulting in the end of the Mali Empire.[92]\nThe old core of the empire was divided into three spheres of influence. Kangaba, the de facto capital of Manden since the time of the last emperor, became the capital of the northern sphere. The Joma area, governed from Siguiri, controlled the central region, which encompassed Niani. Hamana (or Amana), southwest of Joma, became the southern sphere, with its capital at Kouroussa in modern Guinea.[92] Each ruler used the title of mansa, but their authority only extended as far as their own sphere of influence. Despite this disunity in the realm, the realm remained under Mandinka control into the mid-17th century. The three states warred with each other as much, if not more, than they did against outsiders, but rivalries generally stopped when faced with invasion. This trend would continue into colonial times against Tukulor enemies from the west.[93]\nThen, in 1630, the Bamana of Djenn\u00c3\u00a9 declared their version of holy war on all Muslim powers in present-day Mali.[94] They targeted Moroccan pashas still in Timbuktu and the mansas of Manden. In 1645, the Bamana attacked Manden, seizing both banks of the Niger right up to Niani.[94] This campaign gutted Manden and destroyed any hope of the three mansas cooperating to free their land. The only Mandinka power spared from the campaign was Kangaba.\nMama Maghan, mansa of Kangaba, campaigned against the Bamana in 1667 and laid siege to Segou\u2013Koro for a reported three years.[95] Segou, defended by Biton Coulibaly, successfully defended itself and Mama Maghan was forced to withdraw.[95] Either as a counter-attack or simply the progression of pre-planned assaults against the remnants of Mali, the Bamana sacked and burned Niani in 1670.[94] Their forces marched as far north as Kangaba, where the mansa was obliged to make a peace with them, promising not to attack downstream of Mali. The Bamana, likewise, vowed not to advance farther upstream than Niamina.[96] Following this disastrous set of events, Mansa Mama Maghan abandoned the capital of Niani.",

        "text": "The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.[1] It was approved, after much debate (between July 1776 and November 1777), by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for ratification. The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. The federal government received only those powers which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.[2]\nThe Articles formed a war-time confederation of states, with an extremely limited central government. While unratified, the document was used by the Congress to conduct business, direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with foreign nations, and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations. The adoption of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal government, because it did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress, since its organization remained the same.[2]\nAs the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after Shays' Rebellion, individuals began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the Constitutional Convention. It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.[3] On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution.[4] The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing powers.\nThe political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin's proposed Albany Plan, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown. With civil disobedience resulting in coercive, and what the colonials perceived as intolerable acts of Parliament, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.\nIt was an era of constitution writing\u2014most states were busy at the task\u2014and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.[5]\nTo transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the \u201ccustom of nations\u201d demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \u201cmanifesto\u201d which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \u201c[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\u201d[6]\nBeyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve \u201cto take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances\u201d and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established \u201ca firm league\u201d among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.[7]\nOn June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states. The committee met repeatedly, and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776. There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.[8] The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.[9] In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777; the final draft of the Articles served as the de facto system of government used by the Congress (\"the United States in Congress assembled\") until it became de jure by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government. The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government. It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories. Article XIII stipulated that \"their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state\" and \"the Union shall be perpetual\".\nJohn Dickinson's and Benjamin Franklin's handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.\nThe Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have \"a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States.\" After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.\nIn 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution and the new government began operations in 1789.[10]\nCongress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:\nPermit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states. Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties...[11]\nThe document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all 13 states. The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was Maryland on February 2, 1781. A ceremonial confirmation of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781, at high noon.[12][13][14] Twelve states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the process. Maryland, however, refused to go along until the landed states, especially Virginia, had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio River to the Union.[15] It would be two years before the Maryland legislature became satisfied that they would follow through, and voted to ratify. The various states ratified the Articles of Confederation on the following dates:[16]\nThe Articles of Confederation contain a preamble, thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section. The preamble declares that the states \"agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union.\" What follows here summarizes the purpose and content of each of the thirteen articles.\nWhile still at war with Britain, the revolution's leaders were divided between forming a national government with powers either strong and centralized (the \"federalists\"), or strictly limited (the \"anti federalists\"). The Continental Congress compromised by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. It empowered Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, but provided no mechanism to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, or even food.[18]\nThe Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it. Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. In September 1783, George Washington complained that Congress was paralyzed.[19] Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.\nThe Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:\nGeorge Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.[20]\nThe Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u00e2\u20ac\u201c84. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.[21] Knox wrote:\nThe army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, \"A hoop to the barrel\" or \"Cement to the Union\".[22]\nAs Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, \"As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.\"[22]\nOnce the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, George Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.[23]\nThe Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.[24]\nEven after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1789, Thomas Jefferson, concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote to James Monroe, \"\nFurthermore, the Jay\u2013Gardoqui Treaty with Spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty \u2014 which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity \u2014 the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil \u2014 forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris (1783) was superseded by the implementation of Jay's Treaty in 1795 under the new U.S. Constitution.\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.[26]\nCongress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to John Jay, who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, \"that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.\"[27] Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45\u00c2\u00a0million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were \"the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.\"[28] He argued that Americans should avoid having it said \"that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent\" or that \"her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.\"[29] The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.\nCongress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.\nNevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.\nThe Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River. Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire). Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, eventually became the states of: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.\nNo new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the Province of Quebec (referred to as \"Canada\" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit Frankland (later modified to Franklin), Kentucky, and Vermont to the Union were considered, but none were approved.\nThe peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress\u2014the only federal institution\u2014little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president and no national court.[30][31] Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.[32]\nBy 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786\u00e2\u20ac\u201c87, Shays' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.[33]\nThe Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression \"not worth a continental\". Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.[34]\nWhen John Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.[35]\nBy 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.[36]\nThe idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor. Alexander Hamilton realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.[37]\nThe Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of Henry Laurens and Charles Thomson, who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.\nThe Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.\nOn July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified. North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.\nAfter the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.\nThe other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims.\nOn February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.[38] As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \"among engrossed Bills\" was \"signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\" and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned \"to the first Monday in August next.\" The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781, and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.\nCongress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.\nThe signers and the states they represented were:\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations\nRoger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.\nRobert Morris (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.\nJohn Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).\nThe following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled. Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.[39]\nFor a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see President of the Continental Congress.\nImages of an original draft[clarification needed] of the Articles of Confederation stored at the United States National Archive.\nPreamble through Article V, \u00c2\u00b61\nArticle V, \u00c2\u00b62 through Article VI\nArticle VII through Article IX, \u00c2\u00b62\nArticle IX, \u00b62 through \u00b65\nArticle IX, \u00b65 through Article XIII, \u00b62\nArticle XIII, \u00c2\u00b62 through signatures\nOn January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following James Madison's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict. At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a \"Grand Convention.\" Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from Federalist 39, describes the change this way:\nThe constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.[40]\nIn May 1786, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after Shays' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.\nHistorian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of Patrick Henry, George Mason, and other Anti-Federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:\nAntifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the \"consolidated government\" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a \"splendid empire\" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.[41]\nHistorians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.\nRakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures \"stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.\"[42] The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.\nWhen the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new \"merchant state,\" much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.[43]\nPolitical scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, John Jay of New York and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that \"the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.\"[44]\nAccording to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:\n[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.\nOn the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:\nThe Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.\nThe apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion. In 1788, James Madison remarked (in Federalist No. 40) that the issue had become moot: \"As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.\" Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground. At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.[45] Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.[45]\nModern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus \"other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule\".[46] In contrast, law professor Akhil Amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.[47]\nOn July 3, 1788, the Congress received New Hampshire's all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus, according to its terms, establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states. The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be \"unadvisable\" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so \"under the Articles of Confederation\" only, but not \"under the Constitution\".[48]\nBy the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution. Congress continued to convene under the Articles with a quorum until October.[49][50] On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.[51][52] On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.[51]",

        "text": "\"It's My Party\" is a pop song recorded by multiple artists since the 1960s. In 1963, American singer Lesley Gore's version hit #1 on the pop and rhythm and blues charts in the United States.[1] It was the first hit single for producer Quincy Jones.\nThe song lyrically portrays the discomfiture of a teenage girl at her birthday party when her boyfriend Johnny disappears, only to surface in the company of Judy, another girl, who is \"wearing his ring,\" to indicate she's replaced the birthday girl as his love interest.[2]\nThe song's chorus, \"It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to... You would cry too if it happened to you!\" became a part of American pop cultural language as a phrase used to describe being utterly humiliated and miserable during an event that is supposed to be a happy occasion.\n\"It's My Party\" is in the key of A major.[3] The song's effectiveness is enhanced by several musical touches producer Quincy Jones incorporated, including Latin-sounding rhythms, double tracked vocals and effective horn parts.[2] Allmusic critic Jason Ankeny wrote of the song, \"'It's My Party' remains one of the most vivid evocations of adolescent heartbreak ever waxed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Quincy Jones produced the record, although you'd swear it was Aaron Spelling instead.\"[2]\n\"It's My Party\" was credited to John Gluck, Wally Gold and Herb Weiner, staff writers at the Aaron Schroeder Music firm in 1962. The lyrics were actually written by Seymour Gottlieb, a freelance songwriter. He gave the lyrics to Herb Weiner, with whom he partnered in writing songs, to peddle. It was based on actual events relating to Gottlieb's daughter Judy's \u2018Sweet 16\u2019 party, before which she cried over the prospect of her grandparents being invited.[4] The demo for the song was cut by Barbara Jean English, a girl group veteran (the Clickettes, the Fashions), who was then working as a receptionist at the firm. She also worked with Jimmy Radcliffe, serving as the firm's in-house demo singer. Radcliffe produced the demo, and, according to English, \"tried to persuade Musicor [the label owned by Aaron Schroeder] to release it as a record, or to take me into a master studio and redo it, but they weren't interested.\"[5]\nThe first recording of the song was in 1962 by The Chiffons for their One Fine Day album. It was also recorded by Helen Shapiro for her Helen in Nashville album in February 1963 with Shapiro's regular producer, Norrie Paramor, and also Al Kasha. Shapiro would recall: \"Right from the first time we heard the song on the rough demo back in London, we thought we were going to sock them between the eyes with that one\";[5] however, Shapiro's version was not one of the cuts chosen as an advance single from the album and by the time of the album's release that October the \"It's My Party\" track was perceived as a cover of Lesley Gore's hit.\nLesley Gore recalls that \"It's My Party\" was among some two hundred demos producer Quincy Jones brought to review with her in the den of her family home in February 1963. On hearing \"It's My Party,\" Gore told Jones: \"That's not half bad. I like it. Good melody. Let's put it on the maybe pile.\" The song proved to be the only demo Gore and Jones found agreeable. With Jones producing and Claus Ogerman handling arranging and conducting duties, Gore recorded 'It's My Party' at Bell Sound Studios in Manhattan on 30 March 1963.[5][6]\nIn March 1963 Phil Spector heard the demo of \"It's My Party\" while visiting Aaron Schroeder's office. Wally Gold would recall: \"He [Spector] said, 'Great, I love it. I\u2019m gonna do it with the Crystals.' We [the song's writers] were really excited, because that would ensure that the record was #1!\"[7] Schroeder apparently only learned of the Lesley Gore recording of \"It's My Party\" when Quincy Jones invited him to hear the completed track, which Schroeder found formulaic; believing that Spector would be able to cut a much stronger version of the song with the Crystals and not wanting to lose Spector's good will, Schroeder attempted to convince Jones to suppress the track. Schroeder didn't mention Spector's version to Jones but Jones and Spector both happened to attend a concert with Charles Aznavour at Carnegie Hall on the evening of 30 March 1963 and when they met outside it came up in conversation that Spector had recorded a version of \"It's My Party\" with the Crystals.[note 1] Jones skipped the concert instead spending that night\u2014a Saturday\u2014at Bell Sound Studios making a test pressing of the track comprising one hundred copies. Over the next two days Jones mailed these out to radio programmers in key markets across the US. Gore heard her record played on the radio for the first time that Friday; the official release of \"It's My Party\" came later in the month, with the disc ascending to #1 nationally in four weeks.[5][7] Jones was abroad at the time of \"It's My Party\"'s release. On his return he expressed dismay when Aaron Schroeder advised him that the rush release of \"It's My Party\" had precluded coining a more pleasant name for the singer than \"Lesley Gore,\" to which Schroeder replied: \"Didn't anybody tell you?...Quince, the record's number one. Do you really give a damn what her last name is?\"[5][not in citation given]\nIn 1980, WCBN-FM, the University of Michigan freeform student radio station, played \"It's My Party\" for 18 hours straight the day after Ronald Reagan was elected.[8]\nIn 1981, a remake by British artists Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin was a UK number one hit single for four weeks and was also a major hit in Austria (#3), Germany (#3), the Netherlands (#20), New Zealand (#1), South Africa (#3) and Switzerland (#6). The track reached #72 in the US. This was the first version of the song to reach #1 in the UK.[6] The video for the Stewart/Gaskin version contained a cameo by Thomas Dolby as Johnny, Judy being played by Gaskin in a blond wig.\nBecause of the pop cultural obsession with the song and its tragic nature, Gore recorded a sequel titled \"Judy's Turn to Cry\". In this song, the teenage girl narrator gets her revenge on Judy. In the lyrics the narrator explicitly finds \"foolish\" how much she cried when she saw Johnny and Judy together, and seems determined to start anew. But after she kisses another boy at another party, Johnny gets jealous, punches the other boy and returns to her.[2] Following just two months on the heels of \"It's My Party,\" the sequel reached number five on the charts.",

        "text": "The Mask is a 1994 American superhero dark fantasy comedy film directed by Charles Russell, produced by Bob Engelman, and written by Mike Werb, based on the comic series of the same name published by Dark Horse Comics. The film stars Jim Carrey, Peter Greene, Amy Yasbeck, Peter Riegert, Richard Jeni, Ben Stein, Joely Fisher, and Cameron Diaz in her film debut. It revolves around an unlucky bank clerk finding a mask that grants the wearer cartoon-like superpowers.\nThe film was released on July 29, 1994 by New Line Cinema, becoming a critical and commercial success, grossing over $351.6 million over a $23 million budget and receiving positive reviews. It cemented Carrey's reputation as a dominant actor of the 1990s, and established Diaz long-term as a leading lady. Carrey was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role, and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects but lost to Forrest Gump. A sequel, Son of the Mask, was released in 2005.\nStanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a shy and unlucky bank clerk working at the local Edge City bank. He is frequently ridiculed by everyone around him, except for his Jack Russell Terrier Milo, and his co-worker and best friend Charlie Schumaker (Richard Jeni). Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene), owner of the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow his boss Niko (Orestes Matacena). One day, Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) into Stanley's bank to record its layout, in preparation to rob the bank.\nStanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate. Unable to enter the Coco Bongo to watch Tina perform, Stanley finds a wooden mask near the city's harbor. Placing it on his face transforms him into a green-faced, zoot-suited, bizarre, wisecracking trickster known as the Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will. As The Mask, Stanley exacts revenge on his tormentors and scares off a street gang that attempts to rob him by turning a balloon into a Tommy gun and humiliates two repairman who scammed him earlier.\nThe next morning, Stanley encounters detective Lieutenant Kellaway (Peter Riegert) and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt (Amy Yasbeck) investigating the Mask's activity of the previous night. To attend Tina's performance, he again becomes the Mask to raid the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's plan in the process. At the Coco Bongo, Stanley dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he ends up kissing. Following a confrontation with Tyrell for disrupting the bank robbery, Stanley flees leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit that transforms back into his pajamas, while Tyrell and his men are arrested by Kellaway and his partner Doyle (Jim Doughan).\nBased on the piece of cloth, Kellaway suspects Stanley to be the bank robber. Stanley later consults a psychiatrist (Ben Stein) who has recently published a book on masks and is discovered that the object may be a depiction of Loki, the Norse god of darkness and mischief. The same night, Stanley meets Tina at a local park as the Mask, but the meeting is interrupted by Kellaway, who attempts to capture him. Stanley tricks a large group of police officers into joining him in a mass-performance of the Desi Arnaz song \"Cuban Pete\" and flees with Peggy, but she betrays him to Tyrell for a $50,000 bounty. Using the mask, Tyrell becomes a malevolent green-faced monster. Tyrell's henchmen end up in the possession of the stolen money after Stanley is forced to reveal its location, and they turn Stanley in to the police.\nWhen Tina visits Stanley in the station, he urges her to flee the city. Tina thanks Stanley for his generosity and tells him that she knew he was the Mask all along. She attempts to leave the city, but is captured by Tyrell's men and forcibly taken to a charity ball at the Coco Bongo hosted by Niko and attended by the city's elite, including Mayor Tilton (Ivory Ocean). Upon arrival, the masked Tyrell kills Niko and prepares to destroy both the club and Tina with dynamite. Milo helps Stanley escape from the station, and Stanley brings Kellaway as a cover and hostage in a desperate attempt to stop Tyrell.\nAfter locking Kellaway in his car, Stanley enters the club and manages to enlist the help of Charlie, but is soon after discovered and captured. Tina tricks Tyrell into taking off the mask, which is recovered and donned by Milo, who fights Tyrell's men, while Stanley fights Tyrell, himself. After recovering the mask, Stanley uses its special powers to rescue Tina by swallowing Tyrell's bomb and flushing Tyrell down the drain of the club's ornamental fountain. The police arrive and arrest Tyrell's remaining henchmen and attempt to capture Stanley once again. However, Tilton tells Kellaway to release Stanley because Tyrell was the Mask the whole time and Tilton calls Stanley a hero for his actions and must have a \"meeting\" with Kellaway at dawn.\nAs the sun rises the following day, all charges against Stanley are dropped. To avoid getting involved with the police again, Stanley decides to return the mask back to the harbor. Tina throws the mask into the water, and she and Stanley kiss. Charlie then jumps in the water to retrieve the mask for himself, only to find Milo swimming away with it.\nIn 1989, Mike Richardson and Todd Moyer (who was Executive Vice President of Dark Horse Comics) first approached New Line Cinema about adapting the comic The Mask into a film, after having seen other offers. The main character went through several transformations, and the project was stalled a couple of times.[3]\nOne unused \"Mask\" idea, according to Mike Richardson, was to transform the story into one about a mask-maker who took faces off of corpses to put them on teens and turn them into zombies.[4]\nInitially intended to become a new horror franchise, New Line Cinema offered the job of directing the film to Chuck Russell.[5] However, Russell found the violence of the comic to be off-putting, and wanted the film be less grim and more fun than the source material.[6]\nMike Werb says Chuck Russell tapped him after reading his script for Curious George for Imagine. The two decided to turn The Mask into a wild romantic comedy.[7] Mike Werb wrote his first draft of The Mask in less than six weeks, and less than two months later it was green-lit.[8]\nAccording to Mike Verheiden, they had a first draft screenplay for a film version done back in 1990. Verheiden then wrote the second draft in early 1991, adding more humor, and that ended up being the only work he did on The Mask. After that the film went into development hell.[9]\nThere were a lot of VFX scenes that had to be cut for budget.[10]\nThe Mask's visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Digital Domain. The sequences in the film which involved computer animation were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.[11]\nThe film was a box-office success, grossing $119 million domestically and over $350 million worldwide,[2] becoming the second-highest grossing superhero movie at that time, behind Batman. The film also received positive reviews from critics, including Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, noting Jim Carrey for his \"joyful performance.\"[12] The Mask is one of three films featuring Carrey (the others being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Dumb and Dumber) released in 1994 that helped launch the actor to superstardom, though The Mask was the most successful of these three films both critically and commercially. The film is also notable for immediately establishing Diaz \u2013 previously a complete unknown \u2013 as a major star in Hollywood as well. The film is also considered a cult classic.[citation needed]\nIt currently holds a 77% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus stating \"It misses perhaps as often as it hits, but Carrey's manic bombast, Diaz's blowsy appeal, and the film's overall cartoony bombast keep The Mask afloat.\"[13] On the television program Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, the critics gave the film \"two thumbs up\". Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, gave The Mask a rating score of 56, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" based on 12 reviews.\nThe film was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 67th Academy Awards, but lost to Forrest Gump. In addition, Carrey was nominated for a Golden Globe. Conversely, he was also nominated for a Razzie Award for \"Worst New Star\".\nThe film is also recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nThe Mask: Music From the Motion Picture was released on July 26, 1994 on Chaos Records through Sony Music Entertainment. It features music from Xscape, Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!, Vanessa Williams, Harry Connick Jr., Carrey himself and more.\nThe record label Epic Soundtrax released an orchestral score soundtrack to The Mask shortly after the original soundtrack's release. The score was composed and conducted by Randy Edelman and performed by the Irish Film Orchestra.\nThe film was released on VHS and Laserdisc on January 18, 1995, (and later on DVD) by New Line Home Video. The VHS version included an interview between Jim Carrey and Space Ghost, as a promotion for their corporate sibling Cartoon Network's Space Ghost Coast to Coast after the film. It also had a trailer for Jim Carrey's then-upcoming film, Dumb and Dumber, and ads for the soundtrack to the film, and for what was then branded as Betty Crocker Pop Secret. It was later released on Blu-ray Disc on December 9, 2008.[16] It has an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and is encoded in 1080p/VC-1. Its audio is a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD encoded at a 16 bit / 48\u00c2\u00a0kHz sample rate. Special features include additional scenes, production details and two commentary tracks, one by director Chuck Russell and the other by the rest of the production crew.\nAn animated television series was made, The Mask: Animated Series, and a video game for the Super Nintendo, The Mask, were both based on the film.\nAfter the success of the original, a sequel was planned, with magazine Nintendo Power offering readers a chance, via sweepstakes, to win a cameo role in the film.[17] However Jim Carrey eventually bailed on the project, forcing, amongst other things, Nintendo Power to give the winner of the contest the equivalent cash value instead.[17] A critically panned sequel, Son of the Mask, not featuring Carrey, was eventually released in 2005.\nOn the possibility of a third film, Mike Richardson has said, \"We've been talking about reviving The Mask, both in film and in comics. We've had a couple of false starts.\"[18]",

        "text": "The United States Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies,[2] then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. These states would found a new nation\u00a0\u2013 the United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence.\nJohn Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document,[3] which Congress would edit to produce the final version. The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The next day, Adams wrote to his wife Abigail: \"The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America.\"[4] But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the Declaration of Independence was approved.\nAfter ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost, and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.[5] Jefferson's original draft, complete with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, and Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress, are preserved at the Library of Congress. The best-known version of the Declaration is a signed copy that is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and which is popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.[6][7]\nThe sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III, and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, references to the text of the Declaration were few in the following years. Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his rhetoric (as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863) and his policies. Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\nThis has been called \"one of the best-known sentences in the English language\",[8] containing \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[9] The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.[10]\nThe U.S. Declaration of Independence inspired many other similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 Declaration of Flanders issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence across Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the 19th century.[11]\nBelieve me, dear Sir: there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain than I do. But, by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the British Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments of America.\nBy the time that the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations had been deteriorating between the colonies and the mother country since 1763. Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase revenue from the colonies, such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767. Parliament believed that these acts were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep them in the British Empire.[13]\nMany colonists, however, had developed a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.[14] The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional.[15] In the colonies, however, the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament.[16] After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all.[17] Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth,[18] by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.[19]\nThe issue of Parliament's authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the Coercive Acts (known as the Intolerable Acts in the colonies) in 1774 to punish the Province of Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of British America. In September 1774, the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia to coordinate a response. Congress organized a boycott of British goods and petitioned the king for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because King George and the ministry of Prime Minister Lord North were determined not to retreat on the question of parliamentary supremacy. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, \"blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent\".[20]\nMost colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain, even after fighting began in the American Revolutionary War at Lexington and Concord in April 1775.[21] The Second Continental Congress convened at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia in May 1775, and some delegates hoped for eventual independence, but no one yet advocated declaring it.[22] Many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them, yet they still professed loyalty to King George, who they hoped would intercede on their behalf. They were disappointed in late 1775, when the king rejected Congress's second petition, issued a Proclamation of Rebellion, and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was considering \"friendly offers of foreign assistance\" to suppress the rebellion.[23] A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence.[24]\nThomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense was published in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator.[25] Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule.[26] Common Sense introduced no new ideas[27] and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss.[28] Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.[29]\nSome colonists still held out hope for reconciliation, but developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the Prohibitory Act, which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. John Adams, a strong supporter of independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the \"Act of Independency\", calling it \"a compleat Dismemberment of the British Empire\".[30] Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.[31]\nDespite this growing popular support for independence, Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it. Delegates had been elected to Congress by thirteen different governments, which included extralegal conventions, ad hoc committees, and elected assemblies, and they were bound by the instructions given to them. Regardless of their personal opinions, delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action.[32] Several colonies, in fact, expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain, while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue.[33] As public sentiment grew for separation from Great Britain, advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised. For Congress to declare independence, a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for independence, and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct (or grant permission for) its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress. Between April and July 1776, a \"complex political war\"[34] was waged to bring this about.[35]\nIn the campaign to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian Pauline Maier identifies more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776.[36] These \"declarations\" took a variety of forms. Some were formal written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the Halifax Resolves of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence.[37] Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as the Rhode Island legislature declaring its independence from Great Britain on May 4, the first colony to do so.[38] Many \"declarations\" were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few came in the form of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776, by Chief Justice William Henry Drayton of South Carolina: \"the law of the land authorizes me to declare...that George the Third, King of Great Britain...has no authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him.\"[39] Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 2, and signed July 4.[40]\nSome colonies held back from endorsing independence. Resistance was centered in the middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.[41] Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key; if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, it was believed that the others would follow.[41] On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the Pennsylvania Assembly in a special election that had focused on the question of independence.[42] In response, Congress passed a resolution on May 10 which had been promoted by John Adams and Richard Henry Lee, calling on colonies without a \"government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs\" to adopt new governments.[43] The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's John Dickinson, the leader of the anti-independence faction in Congress, who believed that it did not apply to his colony.[44]\nAs was the custom, Congress appointed a committee to draft a preamble to explain the purpose of the resolution. John Adams wrote the preamble, which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies, \"it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed\".[46] Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under proprietary governance.[47] Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest.[48] Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration would still have to be made.[49]\nOn the same day that Congress passed Adams's radical preamble, the Virginia Convention set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence. On May 15, the Convention instructed Virginia's congressional delegation \"to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain\".[50] In accordance with those instructions, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia presented a three-part resolution to Congress on June 7.[51] The motion was seconded by John Adams, calling on Congress to declare independence, form foreign alliances, and prepare a plan of colonial confederation. The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read:\nResolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.[52]\nLee's resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate. Opponents of the resolution conceded that reconciliation was unlikely with Great Britain, while arguing that declaring independence was premature, and that securing foreign aid should take priority.[53] Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle, and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible. All Congress needed to do, they insisted, was to \"declare a fact which already exists\".[54] Delegates from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence, however, and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted. Congress, therefore, voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee's resolution for three weeks.[55] Until then, Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee's resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July.\nSupport for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776. On June 14, the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence and, the following day, the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence.[57] In Pennsylvania, political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly, and a new Conference of Committees under Thomas McKean authorized Pennsylvania's delegates to declare independence on June 18.[58] The Provincial Congress of New Jersey had been governing the province since January 1776; they resolved on June 15 that Royal Governor William Franklin was \"an enemy to the liberties of this country\" and had him arrested.[59] On June 21, they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence.[60]\nOnly Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence towards the end of June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions.[61] On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28.[62] Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait.[63] But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.[64]\nPolitical maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a \"Committee of Five\" to draft a declaration, consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalthough their accounts are frequently cited.[65] What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft.[66] The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally.[3] Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly.[67] He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was \"A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled.\"[68]\nCongress ordered that the draft \"lie on the table\".[69] For two days, Congress methodically edited Jefferson's primary document, shortening it by a fourth, removing unnecessary wording, and improving sentence structure.[70] They removed Jefferson's assertion that Britain had forced slavery on the colonies in order to moderate the document and appease persons in Britain who supported the Revolution.[citation needed] Jefferson wrote that Congress had \"mangled\" his draft version, but the Declaration that was finally produced was \"the majestic document that inspired both contemporaries and posterity,\" in the words of his biographer John Ferling.[70]\nCongress tabled the draft of the declaration on Monday, July 1, and resolved itself into a committee of the whole, with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence.[71] John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation.[72] John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.\nA vote was taken after a long day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.[73]\nOn July 2, South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence. In the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and Robert Morris abstained, allowing the delegation to vote three-to-two in favor of independence. The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of Caesar Rodney, who voted for independence. The New York delegation abstained once again since they were still not authorized to vote for independence, although they were allowed to do so a week later by the New York Provincial Congress.[74] The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention. With this, the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain.[75]\nJohn Adams predicted in a famous letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday.[76] He thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans\u2014including himself\u2014would instead celebrate Independence Day on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.[77]\n\"I am apt to believe that [Independence Day] will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.\"[78]\nAfter voting in favor of the resolution of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.\nThere is a distinct change in wording from this original broadside printing of the Declaration and the final official engrossed copy. The word \"unanimous\" was inserted as a result of a Congressional resolution passed on July 19, 1776:\nResolved, That the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile of \"The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America,\" and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.[80]\nHistorian George Billias says:\nThe declaration is not divided into formal sections; but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts: introduction, preamble, indictment of King George III, denunciation of the British people, and conclusion.[82]\nAsserts as a matter of Natural Law the ability of a people to assume political independence; acknowledges that the grounds for such independence must be reasonable, and therefore explicable, and ought to be explained.\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nOutlines a general philosophy of government that justifies revolution when government harms natural rights.[82]\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\nThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\nA bill of particulars documenting the king's \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" of the Americans' rights and liberties.[82]\nSuch has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on the rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\nThis section essentially finishes the case for independence. The conditions that justified revolution have been shown.[82]\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\nThe signers assert that there exist conditions under which people must change their government, that the British have produced such conditions and, by necessity, the colonies must throw off political ties with the British Crown and become independent states. The conclusion contains, at its core, the Lee Resolution that had been passed on July 2.\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\nThe first and most famous signature on the engrossed copy was that of John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress. Two future presidents (Thomas Jefferson and John Adams) and a father and great-grandfather of two other presidents (Benjamin Harrison) were among the signatories. Edward Rutledge (age 26) was the youngest signer, and Benjamin Franklin (age 70) was the oldest signer. The fifty-six signers of the Declaration represented the new states as follows (from north to south):[83]\nHistorians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence. By Jefferson's own admission, the Declaration contained no original ideas, but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution. As he explained in 1825:\nNeither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.[84]\nJefferson's most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of the preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence.[85] They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King James\u00c2\u00a0II.[86] During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king.[87] The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.[88]\nJefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration.[89] English political theorist John Locke is usually cited as one of the primary influences, a man whom Jefferson called one of \"the three greatest men that have ever lived\".[90] In 1922, historian Carl L. Becker wrote, \"Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's second treatise on government.\"[91] The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey argued in 1937 for the dominant influence of Swiss jurist Jean Jacques Burlamaqui, declaring that Jefferson and Locke were at \"two opposite poles\" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase \"pursuit of happiness\" instead of \"property\".[92] Other scholars emphasized the influence of republicanism rather than Locke's classical liberalism.[93] Historian Garry Wills argued that Jefferson was influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment, particularly Francis Hutcheson, rather than Locke,[94] an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.[95]\nLegal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists.[96] Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's The Law of Nations, the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was \"continually in the hands of the members of our Congress\".[97] Armitage writes, \"Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood\"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was \"to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States\". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain.[98] The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.[99][100][101][102]\nThe Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4.[103] But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.[104]\nThe Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776, according to the 1911 record of events by the U.S. State Department under Secretary Philander C. Knox.[105] On August 2, 1776, a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons.[105] Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4.[105] Signer Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire was seated in the Continental Congress in November; he asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time, and signed on November 4, 1776.[105]\nHistorians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776.[106] In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4.[107] According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2.[108] Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.[109]\nTwo future U.S. presidents were among the signatories: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of John Hancock, who presumably signed first as President of Congress.[110] Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and the term John Hancock emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for \"signature\".[111] A commonly circulated but apocryphal account claims that, after Hancock signed, the delegate from Massachusetts commented, \"The British ministry can read that name without spectacles.\" Another apocryphal report indicates that Hancock proudly declared, \"There! I guess King George will be able to read that!\"[112]\nVarious legends emerged years later about the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now \"all hang together\", and Benjamin Franklin replied: \"Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.\" The quotation did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.[113]\nThe Syng inkstand used at the signing was also used at the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787.\nAfter Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania.[114] A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.[115]\nPresident of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General George Washington, instructing him to have it proclaimed \"at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper\".[116] Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in New York City on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army.[114] After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.[117]\nBritish officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain.[118] It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid-August, it had reached Florence and Warsaw by mid-September, and a German translation appeared in Switzerland by October. The first copy of the Declaration sent to France got lost, and the second copy arrived only in November 1776.[119] It reached Portuguese America by Brazilian medical student \"Vendek\" Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Maia e Barbalho, who had met with Thomas Jefferson in N\u00eemes.\nThe Spanish-American authorities banned the circulation of the Declaration, but it was widely transmitted and translated: by Venezuelan Manuel Garc\u00c3\u00ada de Sena, by Colombian Miguel de Pombo, by Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte, and by New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler, who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821.[120] The North Ministry did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer John Lind to publish a response entitled Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress.[121] British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" to African Americans.[122] Thomas Hutchinson, the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal.[123][124] These pamphlets challenged various aspects of the Declaration. Hutchinson argued that the American Revolution was the work of a few conspirators who wanted independence from the outset, and who had finally achieved it by inducing otherwise loyal colonists to rebel.[125] Lind's pamphlet had an anonymous attack on the concept of natural rights written by Jeremy Bentham, an argument that he repeated during the French Revolution.[126] Both pamphlets asked how the American slaveholders in Congress could proclaim that \"all men are created equal\" without freeing their own slaves.[127]\nWilliam Whipple, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who had fought in the war, freed his slave Prince Whipple because of revolutionary ideals. In the postwar decades, other slaveholders also freed their slaves; from 1790 to 1810, the percentage of free blacks in the Upper South increased to 8.3 percent from less than one percent of the black population.[128] All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804.\nThe official copy of the Declaration of Independence was the one printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision. It was sent to the states and to the Army and was widely reprinted in newspapers. The slightly different \"engrossed copy\" (shown at the top of this article) was made later for members to sign. The engrossed version is the one widely distributed in the 21st century. Note that the opening lines differ between the two versions.[79]\nThe copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or parchment copy. It was probably engrossed (that is, carefully handwritten) by clerk Timothy Matlack.[129] A facsimile made in 1823 has become the basis of most modern reproductions rather than the original because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century.[129] In 1921, custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration was transferred from the State Department to the Library of Congress, along with the United States Constitution. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944.[130] In 1952, the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the National Archives and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the \"Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom\".[131]\nThe document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as the Declaration of Independence, but historian Julian P. Boyd argued that the Declaration, like Magna Carta, is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in The National Archives in England in 2009.[132]\nIn 1777, Congress commissioned Mary Katherine Goddard to print a new broadside that listed the signers of the Declaration, unlike the Dunlap broadside.[129][133] Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist.[133] A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant.[133]\nSeveral early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved. Jefferson kept a four-page draft that late in life he called the \"original Rough draught\".[134] It is not known how many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members. In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting.[135] Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft to friends, with slight variations.\nDuring the writing process, Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps to other members of the drafting committee,[134] who made a few more changes. Franklin, for example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original phrase \"We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable\" to \"We hold these truths to be self-evident\".[136] Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee.[134] The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost, and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process,[137] or destroyed during the debates in accordance with Congress's secrecy rule.[138]\nOn April 21, 2017, it was announced that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in an archive in Sussex, England. Named by its finders the \"Sussex Declaration\", it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders refer to as the \"Matlack Declaration\") in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States. How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory James Wilson, who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people.[139][140]\nThe Declaration was neglected in the years immediately following the American Revolution, having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States.[141] Early celebrations of Independence Day largely ignored the Declaration, as did early histories of the Revolution. The act of declaring independence was considered important, whereas the text announcing that act attracted little attention.[142] The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the United States Constitution, and its language was not incorporated into that document.[143] George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words.[144] \"In none of these documents\", wrote Pauline Maier, \"is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles.\"[145]\nMany leaders of the French Revolution admired the Declaration of Independence[145] but were also interested in the new American state constitutions.[146] The inspiration and content of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789) emerged largely from the ideals of the American Revolution.[147] Its key drafts were prepared by Lafayette, working closely in Paris with his friend Thomas Jefferson. It also borrowed language from George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights.[148][149] The declaration also influenced the Russian Empire. The document had a particular impact on the Decembrist revolt and other Russian thinkers.\nAccording to historian David Armitage, the Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of declarations of independence that announced the creation of new states.\nOther French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration;[150] others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860\u00e2\u20ac\u201c61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945).[151] These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.[152]\nOther countries have used the Declaration as inspiration or have directly copied sections from it. These include the Haitian declaration of January 1, 1804, during the Haitian Revolution, the United Provinces of New Granada in 1811, the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816, the Chilean Declaration of Independence in 1818, Costa Rica in 1821, El Salvador in 1821, Guatemala in 1821, Honduras in (1821), Mexico in 1821, Nicaragua in 1821, Peru in 1821, Bolivian War of Independence in 1825, Uruguay in 1825, Ecuador in 1830, Colombia in 1831, Paraguay in 1842, Dominican Republic in 1844, Texas Declaration of Independence in March 1836, California Republic in November 1836, Hungarian Declaration of Independence in 1849, Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand in 1835, and the Czechoslovak declaration of independence from 1918 drafted in Washington D.C. with Gutzon Borglum among the drafters. The Rhodesian declaration of independence, ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one as well; however, it omits the phrases \"all men are created equal\" and \"the consent of the governed\".[120][153][154][155] The South Carolina declaration of secession from December 1860 also mentions the U.S. Declaration of Independence, though it, like the Rhodesian one, omits references to \"all men are created equal\" and \"consent of the governed\".\nInterest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of the United States's first political parties.[156] Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration.[157] But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author.[158] Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it.[159] But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.\nA less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the War of 1812, thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution.[160] In 1817, Congress commissioned John Trumbull's famous painting of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the Capitol.[161] The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document.[162] Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s,[163] giving birth to what Garry Wills called the \"cult of the signers\".[164] In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document were published for the first time.\nWhen interest in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant: the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George. But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights.[165] The Constitution and the Bill of Rights lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support.[166] Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others.[167] In 1848, for example, the Seneca Falls Convention of women's rights advocates declared that \"all men and women are created equal\".[168]\nA key step marking the evolution of the Declaration in the nation's consciousness is the now well-known painting Declaration of Independence by Connecticut political painter John Trumbull. It was commissioned by the United States Congress in 1817. 12-by-18-foot (3.7 by 5.5\u00c2\u00a0m) in size, it has hung in the United States Capitol Rotunda since 1826. It has been often reproduced, and is the visual image most associated by Americans with the Declaration.\nThe painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.[170]\nThe painting, the figures painted from life when possible, does not contain all the signers. Some had died and images could not be located. One figure had participated in the drafting but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time.\nIt is, however, an accurate depiction of the room in the building known today as Independence Hall, the centerpiece of the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Trumbull visited the room, which was where the Second Continental Congress met, when researching for his painting. At the time it was the Pennsylvania State House.\nThe apparent contradiction between the claim that \"all men are created equal\" and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Great Britain's role in the slave trade, but this was deleted from the final version.[171] Jefferson himself was a prominent Virginia slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves.[172] Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist Thomas Day wrote in a 1776 letter, \"If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.\"[173]\nIn the 19th century, the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement. Historian Bertram Wyatt-Brown wrote that \"abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document\".[174] Abolitionist leaders Benjamin Lundy and William Lloyd Garrison adopted the \"twin rocks\" of \"the Bible and the Declaration of Independence\" as the basis for their philosophies. \"As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the Bible, in our land,\" wrote Garrison, \"we will not despair.\"[175] For radical abolitionists such as Garrison, the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the right of revolution. Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution, and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration.[176]\nThe controversial question of whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821.[177] Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country.[178] Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.[179]\nWith the antislavery movement gaining momentum, defenders of slavery such as John Randolph and John C. Calhoun found it necessary to argue that the Declaration's assertion that \"all men are created equal\" was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people.[180] During the debate over the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1853, for example, Senator John Pettit of Indiana argued that the statement \"all men are created equal\" was not a \"self-evident truth\" but a \"self-evident lie\".[181] Opponents of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, including Salmon P. Chase and Benjamin Wade, defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.[182]\nThe Declaration's relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by Abraham Lincoln, a little-known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers.[183] Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution, and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away.[10] For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 Peoria speech, Lincoln said:\nNearly eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a \"sacred right of self-government\".\u2026 Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust.\u2026 Let us repurify it. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it, the practices, and policy, which harmonize with it.\u2026 If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union: but we shall have saved it, as to make, and keep it, forever worthy of the saving.[184]\nThe meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the famed debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase \"all men are created equal\" in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify the independence of the United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any \"inferior or degraded race\".[185] Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. \"I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere,\" he said.[186] During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration:\nI think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dequal in \"certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.[187]\nAccording to Pauline Maier, Douglas's interpretation was more historically accurate, but Lincoln's view ultimately prevailed. \"In Lincoln's hands,\" wrote Maier, \"the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document\" with \"a set of goals to be realized over time\".[188]\nLike Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration.[190] The Constitution did not use the word \"equality\", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that \"all men are created equal\" remained a part of the nation's founding principles.[191] He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: \"Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\"\nLincoln's view of the Declaration became influential, seeing it as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution. \"For most people now,\" wrote Garry Wills in 1992, \"the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means, as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it.\"[192] Admirers of Lincoln such as Harry V. Jaffa praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably Willmoore Kendall and Mel Bradford, argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated states' rights by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.[193]\nIn July 1848, the first woman's rights convention, the Seneca Falls Convention, was held in Seneca Falls, New York. The convention was organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Mary Ann McClintock, and Jane Hunt. In their \"Declaration of Sentiments\", patterned on the Declaration of Independence, the convention members demanded social and political equality for women. Their motto was that \"All men and women are created equal\" and the convention demanded suffrage for women. The suffrage movement was supported by William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass.[194][195]\nThe adoption of the Declaration of Independence was dramatized in the 1969 Tony Award\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwinning musical 1776, and the 1972 movie of the same name, as well as in the 2008 television miniseries John Adams.[citation needed]\nThe Declaration was chosen to become the first digitized text (1971).[196]\nSince 1976 (the United States Bicentennial), Trumbull's Declaration of Independence has been used on the back of the United States two-dollar bill.\nIn 1984, the Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration was dedicated in Constitution Gardens on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the signatures of all the original signers are carved in stone with their names, places of residence, and occupations.\nThe new One World Trade Center building in New York City (2014) is 1776 feet high, to symbolize the year that the Declaration of Independence was signed.[197][198][199]",

        "text": "The City of San Antonio is one of the oldest Spanish colonization of the European settlements in Texas and was, for decades, its largest city. Before Spanish colonization, the site was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Payaya Indians were likely those who encountered the first Europeans.\nThe \"Villa de Bejar\" was founded by Spanish explorers on May 5th, 1718, by then Governor Martin Alarcon, at the headwaters of the San Pedro Creek.[1] The mission San Antonio de Valero was established on the east bank of the creek and a presidio was 3/4 of a league downstream. Development of the Spanish colonial city followed. A trading post was also established near the presidio and the town developed as the capital of Tejas, a province of colonial Spain. It was the northernmost settlement associated with the Hispanic culture of the Valley of Mexico.\nAfter Mexico achieved independence in 1821, Anglo-American settlers entered the region from the United States. In 1836, Anglo-Americans gained control of Texas in the fighting that gained independence for the Republic of Texas. In 1845 Texas was annexed by the United States of America, and became a state.\nAfter thousands of years of succeeding indigenous cultures, the historic Payaya Indians coalesced as a distinct ethnic group. They lived near the San Antonio River Valley, in the San Pedro Springs area, which they called Yanaguana, meaning \u201crefreshing waters\u201d.\nIn 1536, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, a shipwrecked Spanish explorer who was enslaved by Native Americans for a period, visited the interior of what would later be called Texas. He saw and described the river later to be named the San Antonio.[2] He eventually rejoined Spanish colleagues in Mexico City.\nFrom the Convent of Quer\u00e9taro, organized several expeditions to the region of Texas, an area of great strategic importance to the Spanish crown. With that goal in 1675, an expedition formed by Fray Antonio de Olivares, Fray Francisco Hidalgo, Fray Juan Larios and Fernando Orozco Josu\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez y hay hete su\u00e9ter is Natalia Orozco, were sent to explore and recognize the country beyond the borders of Rio Grande, to test the possibilities of new settlements in the area.\nIn 1691, a group of Spanish explorers and missionaries came upon the river and Native American settlement (located in the area of present-day La Villita) on June 13. As it was the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua, Italy, they named the place and river San Antonio in his honor.\nIn 1709, the expedition headed by Pedro de Aguirre, together with Fray Antonio de Olivares and Fray Isidro de Espinosa was undertaken which consisted of exploration of the territory where the present city of San Antonio is located and extended to the Colorado River. The same year he traveled to Spain to convince the authorities to establish and maintain new missions on the bank of the San Antonio River at the present-day city of San Antonio.\nIn 1716, Fray Antonio de Olivares wrote to the Viceroy of New Spain, telling their hopes and plans for the future mission, and urged him to send families of settlers to found a town.[3] In the same letter he stressed that it was necessary for some of these families to be skilled in the useful arts and industries, \"to teach the Indians all that should be required to be useful and capable citizens\" .\nFinally, perseverance of Fray Antonio was answered and the Viceroyalty gave formal approval for the mission in late 1716, and assigned responsibility for their establishment to Mart\u00edn de Alarc\u00f3n, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas.[3]\nFray Antonio de Olivares was organizing the founding of the new mission, from the next Mission San Francisco Solano, turning often met with the Indians of the area (Payaya Indians), gradually earning their love and respect. It remained only at the site of the mission for some time organizing everything with the Indians, the group finally stood straw structure, branches and mud near the head of San Antonio River. This mission was called San Antonio de Valero, a name derived from \"San Antonio de Padua\" and Viceroy New Spain, Marquess of Valero. The mission was located near a community of Coahuiltecan and was originally inhabited by indigenous three to five converted from Mission San Francisco Solano.[3]\nUnfortunately, his work was suspended for some time, suffered an accident while crossing a bridge, the foot of the animal he was riding slipped into a hole, falling violently to the ground and breaking his leg. When he could walk again, mission changed place, transferring it to the west bank of the river, where floods were less likely. On orders of his religious order, Fray Antonio de Olivares transferred the Mission San Francisco Solano to the new mission of San Antonio de Valero.[3]\nHe also built the Presidio San Antonio de B\u00e9xar, on the west side of the San Antonio River, approximately 1 mile from the mission.[3] It was designed to protect the system of missions and civilian settlements in central Texas and to ensure the representation of Spain in the region of the aggression of French, British and Americans. The presidio consisted of an adobe building, thatched with grass, with soldiers quartered in brush huts. As settlers concentrated around the presidio complex and mission, began to form the town of Bejar or Bexar, convert it in the cornerstone of Spanish Texas. Being located in the center of several operating systems mission Bejar suffered not the needs and anxieties of other presidios. Despite occasional Indian attacks, the defense of the presidio walls were never completed or was deemed necessary, as the mission was complemented later converted into the main unit of walled defense.\nThe operating complex was completed with the construction of the first ditch of Texas (Acequia Madre de Valero),[4] 6 miles long, built to irrigate 400 hectares and supply of the inhabitants of the new facilities built. It was vital to the missions to be able to divert and control water from the San Antonio River, in order to grow crops and to supply water to the people in the area. This particular acequia was the beginning of a much wider acequia system. Acequia Madre de Valero ran from the area currently known as Brackenridge Park and southward to what is now Hemisfair Plaza and South Alamo Street.[5] Part of it that is not viewable by the public runs beneath the Menger Hotel. The acequia was restored in 1968 and that year was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark.[6]\nFray Antonio de Olivares was aided by Payaya Indians to build the bridge that connected the Misi\u00c3\u00b3n de San Antonio de Valero and Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, and the Acequia Madre de Valero.\nOn May 1, 1718, according to a statement certified to be preserved, Don Martin de Alarcon gave possession to Fray Antonio de Olivares of the Misi\u00c3\u00b3n de San Antonio de Valero, later known as \"The Alamo\", based officially the mission.[3]\nOn May 5, was founded the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, on the west side of the San Antonio River, the source of the present city of San Antonio Texas. The event was chaired by Martin de Alarc\u00c3\u00b3n, settling around 30 families in the surrounding area.[3]\nOn July 8, 1718 held at the new Mission San Antonio de Valero the first baptism, as reflected in the baptismal register of the mission.[3]\nOn February 14, 1719, the Marquess of San Miguel de Aguayo made a report to the king of Spain proposing that 400 families be transported from the Canary Islands, Galicia, or Habana to populate the province of Texas. In June 1730, 25 families come to Cuba, and 10 families were sent to Veracruz. Under the leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the group marched overland to the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731. The group joined the military community that had existed since 1718, forming the first government of the city and taking as headquarters building Presidio of San Antonio de B\u00c3\u00a9jar.\nIn 1719, Margil obtained permission from the Marqu\u00e9s de San Miguel de Aguayo to found a second mission at San Antonio. However, Father Olivares he opposed it. Despite of it, the Zacatecan Franciscans founded Mission San Jos\u00e9 y San Miguel de Aguayo, next to the San Antonio River, on February 23, 1720.\nSan Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas. After the failure of Spanish missions to the north of the city, San Antonio became the farthest northeastern extension of the Hispanic culture of the Valley of Mexico. The city was for most of its history the capital of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of Tejas. From San Antonio the Camino Real, today's Nacogdoches Road, ran to the American border at the small frontier town of Nacogdoches.\nAfter Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, Anglo American settlers, at the invitation of the Mexican government via Empresarios such as Stephen F. Austin, began to settle in Texas in areas east and northeast of San Antonio.\nWhen Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, after being elected President of Mexico in 1833, rescinded the Mexican Constitution of 1824, violence ensued in many provinces of Mexico. In Texas the Anglo settlers joined many Hispanic Texans, who called themselves Tejanos, in demanding a return to the Constitution of 1824. In a series of battles the Anglo Texans, who called themselves Texians, supported by a significant number of Tejano allies, initially succeeded in forcing the Mexican military to retreat from Texas.\nUnder the leadership of Ben Milam, in the Battle of Bexar, December, 1835, Texian forces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by General Martin Perfecto de Cos, Santa Anna's brother-in-law. Forces opposing Santa Anna took control of the entire province of Texas. Today Milam Park and the Cos House in San Antonio commemorate this battle.\nAfter putting down resistance in other regions of Mexico, in the spring of 1836, Santa Anna led a Mexican army back into Texas and marched on San Antonio. He intended to avenge the defeat of Cos and end the Texan rebellion. Sam Houston, believing that San Antonio could not be defended against a determined effort by the regular Mexican army, called for the Texan forces to abandon the city.\nA volunteer force under the joint command of William Barrett Travis, newly arrived in Texas, and James Bowie, and including Davy Crockett and his company of Tennesseans, and Juan Seguin's company of Hispanic Texan volunteers, occupied and fortified the deserted mission, the Alamo. They were determined to hold San Antonio against all opposition.\nThe defenders of the Alamo included Anglo and Hispanic Texans who fought side by side under a banner - the flag of Mexico with the numerals \"1824\" superimposed. This was meant to indicate that the defenders were fighting for their rights to democratic government under the Mexican constitution of that year. During their siege, the Texas Congress declared an independent Republic of Texas.\nThe [Battle of the Alamo] took place from February 23 to March 6, 1836. At first the battle was primarily a siege marked by artillery duels and small skirmishes. After twelve days Santa Anna, tired of waiting for his heavy artillery, determined to take the Alamo by storm.\nBefore dawn on March 6, he launched his troops against the walls of the Alamo in three separate attacks. The third attack overwhelmed the defenses of the weak north wall. The defenders retreated to the Long Barracks and the Chapel, where they fought to the last man. Most historians agree that a handful of the defenders were captured, but were quickly executed as rebels on the specific orders of Santa Anna. The deaths of these \"Martyrs to Texas Independence\" inspired greater resistance to Santa Anna's regime. The cry, \"Remember the Alamo,\" became the rallying point of the Texas Revolution.\nTexas won its independence at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21.\nJuan Segu\u00edn, who had organized the company of Tejanos who fought and died at the Alamo, was with Sam Houston when it fell. Acting as a courier from the besieged fort, he had delivered a message from Travis to Houston, who forbade his return. Segu\u00edn would later earn fame for leading a company of Tejano volunteers at the Battle of San Jacinto. After independence, he was elected to the Texas Senate. He later was elected as mayor of San Antonio. In 1842, he was forced out of that office at gunpoint by Anglo-American politicians. The next Hispanic to be elected as mayor of the city was Henry Cisneros in 1981.[7]\nAs the city of San Antonio has grown, the Alamo, which in 1836 was separated by the San Antonio River from downtown, has become an integral part of the modern center city. Alamo Plaza contains the Cenotaph, a monument built in celebration of the centenary of the battle. It bears the names of all known to have fought there on the Texas side. Since 2011, Alamo Trust, Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, has been the official partner of the Texas General Land Office in managing the Alamo complex. Surrounded by many hotels and tourist attractions, it is San Antonio's best-known landmark, featured in the city's flag and seal, and the most visited tourist attraction in the state. San Antonio is nicknamed the \"Alamo City.\" Its yearly Fiesta Week in April commemorates the Texian victory at San Jacinto.\nIn 1845 the United States annexed Texas (with its concurrence) and included it as a state in the Union. This, after some incitement by United States troops along the Mexican border, led to the Mexican War between the United States and Mexico, which concluded with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848). Under this treaty Mexico ceded to the United States not only Texas but all of what is now the American Southwest, excluding a small portion of Arizona and New Mexico. The war was devastating to San Antonio. By its end the city population had been reduced by almost two thirds, to 800 inhabitants.[8]\nPeace and economic connections to the United States restored prosperity to the city, and by 1860, at the start of the Civil War, San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people. From the late 1840s and the period of the German revolutions, many people immigrated to Texas from Germany. They tended to strongly oppose slavery as they had been fighting for justice and freedom. The most successful of the city's German merchants developed houses in the King William district, just south of downtown. Visitors heard German on the streets nearly as frequently as English and Spanish. The Germans created the beer and brewing industry in Texas. The Guenther Flour Mills, Gebhardt's Chili Powder, and Mahncke Park, are local institutions that recall San Antonio's German heritage.\nDuring the Civil War, San Antonio was not deeply involved in the secessionist cause. Many of the city's residents, notably those of ethnic German and Mexican ancestry, supported the Union. After the war, they supported the Republican Party for decades, as well as the Populist Party, which coalesced a multiracial political base in the late nineteenth century. After regaining power in the state legislature, white Democrats passed a poll tax in 1901. It effectively disenfranchised minorities and poor whites. With ethnic minorities and the lower classes of San Antonio and Texas society unable to vote, the Republican Party lost its competitive edge in most areas of the state.\nAfter the war, San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle culture. Anglo Americans learned the Spanish and Mexican techniques of herding cattle on horseback, creating a new generation of cowboys. The major cattle trails for driving stock to markets and railroads, including Chisholm Trail, began in San Antonio. The business promoter \"Bet a Million\" Gates chose San Antonio to demonstrate the value of his barbed wire in the herding of cattle. In 1876 he fenced off Alamo Plaza with the new invention and had cowboys drive a herd of cattle into the wire. When the wire held the cattle, many of the ranchers in attendance quickly placed orders for the new product. San Antonio was crucial during both the beginning and end of the open-range period in American ranching culture.\nDuring the postbellum period, San Antonio remained a frontier city. Its isolation and diverse array of cultures gave it the reputation of being an exotic place. When Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect who two years later designed Central Park in New York City, visited San Antonio in 1856, he described the city as having a \"jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings,\" which gave it a quality, which only New Orleans could rival, of \"odd and antiquated foreignness.\" Much of the mystique that makes San Antonio a tourist destination has its origins in the uniqueness of the city.\nIn 1850, San Antonio became the largest city in Texas with 8,235 people, taking the lead from Galveston. Bolstered by the construction of its first railroad in 1877, and a horrible hurricane that had struck Galveston, San Antonio reemerged as the state's largest city in 1900. It remained in the top spot until 1930, when Dallas and Houston overtook the Alamo City.[9] It connected the city to major markets and\u2014increasingly\u2014the mainstream of American society.\nSan Antonio was often frequented by gun fighters and robbers of the Old West and is particularly associated with Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid members of the Wild Bunch, who often used Fannie Porter's brothel as a hideout.\nMany African Americans in Texas remained in slavery until after the U.S. Civil War ended. There was scarce Union Army activity in Texas, preventing them from joining the Northern lines. Some escaped over the borders to areas where the Union Army was operating. The announcement of emancipation happened to be delayed until June 19, 1865, when officials announced that slavery had been formally abolished. This is celebrated in Texas as \"\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the streets of Downtown, the old Spanish and Mexican city, were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic. In the process many historic building were destroyed. These included the Veramendi House, the home of the prominent family into which Jim Bowie had married when he came to the city. Standing on the southwest side of the intersection of Houston and Soledad Streets, this building was a massive quadrangle built of adobe around a central courtyard in the typical Mexican style. When the street was widened by 20 feet, the building was leveled.\nLike many municipalities in the American Southwest, San Antonio has had steady population growth since the late twentieth century. The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 census to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005 through population growth, immigration, and land annexation (considerably enlarging the physical area of the city).",

        "text": "The Traveling Wilburys (sometimes shortened to the Wilburys) were a British-American supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. The band recorded two albums, the first in 1988 and the second in 1990, though Orbison died before the second was recorded.\nThe project's work received much anticipation given the diverse nature of the singer-songwriters. Their debut album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 proved an enduring critical success, in 1989 and 1990 winning accolades such as a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tom Petty\nGeorge Harrison first mentioned the Traveling Wilburys publicly during a radio interview with Bob Coburn on the show Rockline in February 1988.[2] When asked how he planned to follow up the success of his Cloud Nine album, Harrison replied: \"What I'd really like to do next is ... to do an album with me and some of my mates ... It's this new group I got [in mind]: it's called the Traveling Wilburys, I'd like to do an album with them and then later we can all do our own albums again.\"[3][nb 1] According to Jeff Lynne, who co-produced Cloud Nine, Harrison introduced the idea of the two of them starting a band together around two months into the sessions for his album,[5] which began in early January 1987.[6] When discussing who the other members might be, Harrison chose Bob Dylan and Lynne opted for Roy Orbison.[5][7] The term \"Wilbury\" also originated during the Cloud Nine sessions. Referring to recording errors created by faulty equipment, Harrison jokingly remarked to Lynne, \"We'll bury 'em in the mix.\"[8] Thereafter, they used the term for any small error in performance. Harrison first suggested \"the Trembling Wilburys\" as the group's name; at Lynne's suggestion, they amended it to \"Traveling Wilburys\".[2]\nDuring his Rockline interview, Harrison voiced his support for Dylan,[9] at a time when the latter was experiencing an artistic and commercial low point in his career.[10] Harrison and Lynne became friends with Tom Petty in October 1987, when Petty and his band, the Heartbreakers, toured Europe as Dylan's backing group.[11][12] The friendship continued in Los Angeles later that year. There, Harrison struck up a musical rapport with Petty based on their shared love of 1950s rock 'n' roll,[13] and Lynne began collaborating with Petty on what became the latter's debut solo album, Full Moon Fever,[14] and writing songs with Orbison, Lynne's longtime musical hero,[15] for his comeback album, Mystery Girl.[16][17] According to Petty, Harrison's dream for the Wilburys was to handpick the participants and create \"the perfect little band\", but the criteria for inclusion were governed most by \"who you could hang out with\".[18] The five musicians also bonded over a shared appreciation of the English comedy troupe Monty Python.[19] Harrison, who had worked with the members of Monty Python on various productions by his company HandMade Films since the late 1970s, particularly appreciated Orbison's gift for impersonation and his ability to recite entire sketches by the troupe.[20][21]\nThe band came together in April 1988,[22] when Harrison was in Los Angeles to oversee the filming of his HandMade production Checking Out.[23] At that time, Warner Bros. Records asked Harrison for a new song to serve as the B-side for the European release of his third single from Cloud Nine, \"This Is Love\".[24] During a meal with Lynne and Orbison, Harrison asked Lynne to help him record the track and invited Orbison to attend the session,[25] which he then arranged to take place at Dylan's garage studio in Malibu[4] since no professional studios were available at such short notice.[9] Petty's involvement came about when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty's house and invited him to attend also.[26][27]\nWorking on a song that Harrison had recently started writing, the ensemble completed the track, which they titled \"Handle with Care\" after a label on a box in Dylan's garage.[4] When Harrison presented the recording to Warner Bros., the executives insisted that the song was too good to be used as \"filler\" on a European single. In Petty's recollection, Harrison and Lynne then decided to realise their idea of forming a Wilburys band, and first invited him to join before phoning Dylan, who also agreed to join.[28] That night, Harrison, Lynne and Petty drove to Anaheim to see Orbison perform at the Celebrity Theatre and recruited him for the group shortly before he went on stage. In Petty's description, Orbison performed an \"unbelievable show\", during which \"we'd punch each other and go, 'He's in our band, too.' ... We were all so excited.\"[28]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c George Harrison\nThe band members decided to create a full album together, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. Video footage of the creative process was partly shot by British photographer NJ Latham and later edited by Harrison. The album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988[30] to allow for Dylan's limited availability as he prepared for his upcoming US tour.[31][32] These sessions were held in the house of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart, in Los Angeles.[33] The five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen;[34] once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine), the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night.[35][36] Petty recalled that, as a friend but also an avowed fan of Dylan's, Harrison felt the need to clear the air on the first day by saying to him: \"We know that you're Bob Dylan and everything, but we're going to just treat you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, great. Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\"[37] While most of the songs had a primary composer,[38] all of the band members were creative equals.[31] Petty later described Harrison as the Wilburys' \"leader and manager\",[39] and credited him with being a bandleader and producer that had a natural instinct for bringing out the best in people and keeping a recording session productive.[40][nb 2] As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member to decide who should sing a particular lead vocal part.[43][44] The two producers then flew back to England; Lynne recalls that, throughout the flight, he and Harrison enthused about how to turn the sparse, acoustic-based tracks into completed recordings.[45] Overdubs and further recording took place at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT,[28] with \"Sideburys\" Jim Keltner (drums), Jim Horn (saxophones) and Ray Cooper (percussion).[22] Harrison described the band's sound as \"skiffle for the 1990s\".[46]\nThe album was released on 18 October 1988.[47] Distributed by Warner Bros., it appeared on the new Wilbury record label rather than on Harrison's Dark Horse label, in the interests of maintaining the group identity.[42] Over the months following the end of recording in the summer, contractual issues had been successfully negotiated between Warner's and the record companies representing Dylan, Petty, Lynne and Orbison. As was the case in 1971 when EMI prepared Harrison's multi-artist live album from the Concert for Bangladesh for release, Columbia, Dylan's label, presented the main stumbling block.[22][nb 3] In the album credits, the \"Wilburys\" joke was extended further, with the band members listed under various pseudonyms and pretending to be half-brothers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.[48][49] During promotion for the album, Orbison played along with the mock history, saying: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder, but I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"[50][30]\nVol. 1 was a critical and commercial success, and revitalised the careers of Dylan, Orbison and Petty.[51] As Harrison had intended, the album defied contemporary musical trends such as hip hop, acid house and synthesised pop; author Alan Clayson likens its release to \"a Viking longship docking in a hovercraft terminal\".[52][nb 4] The album produced two successful singles and went on to achieve triple-platinum certification for sales in the United States. It was nominated for several awards and won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Liner notes on the album cover were written by Monty Python's Michael Palin under a pseudonym.[30] Palin's essay was based on an idea by Derek Taylor,[49] who wrote an extensive fictional history of the Wilburys family that otherwise went unused.[39] Harrison planned a feature film about the band, to be produced by HandMade and directed by David Leland, but contractual problems ended the project.[54]\nRoy Orbison died of a heart attack on 6 December 1988.[55] In tribute to him, the music video for the band's second single, \"End of the Line\", shows Orbison's guitar rocking in a chair as the rest of the group play, along with a photo of him in the background.[56] Although there was speculation in the press that Del Shannon or Roger McGuinn might join the Wilburys, the remaining members never considered replacing Orbison.[39][57][nb 5] Lynne later said: \"We'd become this unit, we were all good pals \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We always knew we were going to do another one, and now it's just the four of us.\"[57]\nIn March 1990, Harrison, Lynne, Petty and Dylan reunited to work on a second Wilburys album, which they intentionally misnumbered Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[58] It was preceded by a non-album single, a cover of \"Nobody's Child\",[49] which the band recorded for Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal charity project.[58][59] The duration of the main album sessions was again dictated by Dylan's touring schedule and limited availability. Having asked Dylan to record a lead vocal for all the songs before his departure, Harrison was then loath to replace many of the parts, resulting in a greater prominence for Dylan as a lead singer.[58] Although he ceded his own role as a lead vocalist to Dylan and to Petty,[60] Harrison took over more of the production and contributed more prominently as a lead guitarist than before.[61] Petty described the album as \"a little more rough and ready, a bit more raucous\" than Vol. 1,[62] while Dylan said the new songs were more developed as compositions relative to the \"scraped up from jam tapes\" approach to the band's debut.[58]\nVol. 3 was released on 29 October 1990.[63] It was dedicated to Orbison, as \"Lefty Wilbury\", the pseudonym that Orbison had used in 1988 in honour of his hero Lefty Frizzell.[64] The album met with less success than the previous one. According to Warner Bros. head Mo Ostin, the choice of album title came about through \"George being George\";[8] apparently Harrison was making a wry reference to the appearance of a bootleg that served as a sort of Volume 2.[65] The album's liner notes were written by Eric Idle, another Python member, who again adopted a pseudonym. For the band's final single, \"Wilbury Twist\", they filmed a video in which Idle, John Candy and other comedic actors attempt to master the song's eponymous dance style. The clip was filmed in Los Angeles and completed on 28 February 1991.[66][nb 6]\nAccording to Jim Keltner, the Wilburys' drummer, the decision on the group's future after Vol. 3 lay with Harrison. Keltner said that from his conversations with Lynne, Petty and Dylan, they were all keen to reunite, whereas Harrison wavered in his enthusiasm.[68] While Harrison was against the idea of touring, Petty recalled: \"I kept getting down on my knees in front of George, saying, 'Please, it's so much money!\"[68]\nAfter his 1991 tour of Japan \u2013 his first series of concerts since 1974 \u2013 Harrison spoke of a possible Traveling Wilburys tour:\nThat would be something I'd like to experience. I've always played around in my own mind what a Wilburys tour could be. Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys? It's an intriguing thought. We could have a great band up there and the four of us could play acoustic if we wanted to. We could all sing \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and Bob could sing \"Something\". Or we could just sing our individual songs and make them Wilbury tunes, as if we'd recorded them that way. Whatever it was, we could do it.\nThe Wilburys tour never came about. Petty said about the Wilburys touring:\nI think it would work, if we wanted to do it. I don't think we ever considered it, really. There were a lot of nights when the conversation would roll around to that. But I don't think anybody ever took it seriously. I think it would ruin it in a way. Then you're obligated to be responsible and it's not in the character of that group. It would make it very formal and that would be the wrong spirit.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Jeff Lynne\nIn the Rolling Stone Press book The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, the Traveling Wilburys are described as \"the ultimate supergroup\", with a line-up that represented four eras of rock music history and included \"three indisputable gods\" in Dylan, Harrison and Orbison. The editors also recognise the band as \"the antithesis of a supergroup\", however, due to the musicians' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project.[70] AllMusic managing editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine has similarly written: \"It's impossible to picture a supergroup with a stronger pedigree than that (all that's missing is a Rolling Stone), but in another sense it's hard to call the Wilburys a true supergroup, since they arrived nearly two decades after the all-star craze of the '70s peaked, and they never had the self-important air of nearly all the other supergroups. That, of course, was the key to their charm \u2026\"[51] Speaking to music journalist Paul Zollo in 2004, Petty agreed that humour and self-effacement had been key factors in the Wilburys' success, adding: \"We wanted to make something good in a world that seemed to get uglier and uglier and meaner and meaner \u2026 And I'm really proud that I was part of it. Because I do think that it brought a little sunshine into the world.\"[71]\nHarrison said the project was an opportunity to \"put a finger up to the rules\" by challenging the norms associated with the music industry.[19] Discussing the Wilburys in Peter Bogdanovich's 2007 documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, Petty said that one of the strengths behind the concept was that it was free of any intervention from record company, management or marketing concerns, and instead developed naturally from a spirit of co-operation and mutual admiration among five established artists.[35] Author Simon Leng recognises the venture as primarily a channel through which Harrison and Dylan could escape the restrictions of their serious media images, but also, in its guise as a \"phantom band\", a development by Harrison of the Rutles' satirical approach to the Beatles' legacy, in this case by \"de-mythologizing\" rock history.[72]\nInspired by the Traveling Wilburys' success and particularly its benefit to Petty and Orbison as artists, Warner's executive and staff producer Lenny Waronker encouraged American guitarist Ry Cooder to form the band Little Village.[73] The group, comprising Cooder, Keltner, John Hiatt and Nick Lowe, released a self-titled album in 1992.[74] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described the Notting Hillbillies' Missing ... Presumed Having a Good Time as a Traveling Wilburys-type side project for Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.[75] Writing in New York magazine in late 1990, Elizabeth Wurtzel cited the Notting Hillbillies' album and the self-titled debut by Hindu Love Gods (a band consisting of Warren Zevon and members of R.E.M.) as examples of a trend whereby, following the Wilburys' Vol. 1, \"more and more albums seem to be the rock-and-roll equivalents of bowling night.\"[76]\nWriting in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin cites the Wilburys' contemporary skiffle as evidence of Lonnie Donegan's continued influence on popular music long after the early 1960s.[77] In his book Lonnie Donegan and the Birth of British Rock & Roll, Patrick Humphries describes the Wilburys as \"a makeshift quintet whose roots were firmly and joyously planted in low-key, low-tech skiffle music\". He credits the band with inspiring a brief revival of Donegan's \"DIY skiffle\", which included Knopfler's Notting Hillbillies.[78]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tom Petty in The True History of the Traveling Wilburys\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a 25-minute documentary titled The True History of the Traveling Wilburys and a collection of music videos. The box set was released in three editions; the standard edition, with both CDs and DVD in a double Digipak package and a 16-page booklet; a \"deluxe\" boxed edition with the CDs and DVD and an extensive 40-page booklet, artist postcards, and photographs; or a \"deluxe\" boxed edition on vinyl. This version omits the DVD, but adds a 12-inch vinyl disc with rare versions of the songs. The release debuted at number 1 in the UK[80] and Australia,[81] and in other countries.[82] On the US Billboard 200 it reached number 9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.\nIn November 2009, Genesis Publications, a company with which Harrison had been associated since the late 1970s,[83] announced the release of a limited edition fine-bound book titled The Traveling Wilburys.[84] Compiled by Olivia Harrison,[85] the book includes rare photographs, recording notes, handwritten lyrics, sketches,[19][86] and first-hand commentary on the band's history, together with a foreword by Lynne.[84] Petty, Lynne, Olivia Harrison, Barbara Orbison, Keltner and Idle were among those who attended the US launch at a Beverly Hills bookshop in March 2010.[87] In an interview to publicise the book, Lynne expressed his sadness at the deaths of Harrison and Orbison, and reflected: \"The Wilburys was such a wonderful band, such a marvellous thing to be part of. They were the best people I could ever wish to work with. Every day was like, 'Wow!' ... it was fun from day one.\"[85]\nJim Keltner, the session drummer and percussionist, was not listed as a Wilbury on either album. However, he is seen in all of the group's music videos, and on the DVD released in 2007, he is given the nickname \"Buster Sidebury\". Overdubs to the bonus tracks \"Maxine\" and \"Like a Ship\" also credited as \"Ayrton Wilbury\", a pseudonym for Dhani Harrison. The name Ayrton was used in honour of F1 racer Ayrton Senna.[88] Jim Horn played saxophone on both albums. The lead guitar on the Volume 3 song \"She's My Baby\" was played by rock guitarist Gary Moore (\"Ken Wilbury\").[89]\nThe Traveling Wilburys contributed the title track, \"Nobody's Child\", to the Romanian Angel Appeal benefit album Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal, released on 24 July 1990. Harrison appeared as Nelson Wilbury on Warner Bros. Records' 1988 holiday promo album Winter Warnerland (which also included Paul Reubens as \"Pee Wee Wilbury\"). In his capacity as producer, Harrison credited himself as \"Spike and Nelson Wilbury\" on his 1992 live album Live in Japan. The same year, the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers single \"Christmas All Over Again\" contained a greeting that read \"Merry Christmas from Nelson and Pee Wee Wilbury.\"",

        "text": "\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" is a song by the Rolling Stones on their 1969 album Let It Bleed. Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, it was named as the 100th greatest song of all time by Rolling Stone magazine in its 2004 list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nJagger commented on the song's beginnings:\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was something I just played on the acoustic guitar\u00e2\u20ac\u201done of those bedroom songs. It proved to be quite difficult to record because Charlie couldn't play the groove and so Jimmy Miller had to play the drums. I'd also had this idea of having a choir, probably a gospel choir, on the track, but there wasn't one around at that point. Jack Nitzsche, or somebody, said that we could get the London Bach Choir and we said, \"That will be a laugh.\"[3]\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was the first song recorded for the album. It exists in two versions, a 5:00 single mix[1] and a 7:28 album mix.[2] \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was recorded on 16 and 17 November 1968 at Olympic Sound Studios in London. It features the London Bach Choir opening the song (the choir opening is only on the album version), highlighting throughout, and bringing it to its conclusion. Jimmy Miller, the Stones' producer at the time, plays drums on this song instead of Charlie Watts. Al Kooper plays piano and organ, as well as the French horn intro, while Rocky Dijon plays congas and maracas.[citation needed]\nIn his review of the song, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said: \"If you buy John Lennon's observation that the Rolling Stones were apt to copy the Beatles' innovations within a few months or so, 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' is the Rolling Stones' counterpart to 'Hey Jude'.\"[4] Jagger said in 1969, \"I liked the way the Beatles did that with 'Hey Jude'. The orchestra was not just to cover everything up\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was something extra. We may do something like that on the next album.\"[5]\nThe three verses (and the varied theme of the fourth verse) address major topics of the 1960s: love, politics, and drugs. Each verse captures the essence of the initial optimism and eventual disillusion, followed by the resigned pragmatism of the chorus.[citation needed]\nUnterberger ebalorated:\nMuch has been made of the lyrics reflecting the end of the overlong party that was the 1960s, as a snapshot of Swinging London burning out. That's a valid interpretation, but it should also be pointed out that there's also an uplifting and reassuring quality to the melody and performance. This is particularly true of the key lyrical hook, when we are reminded that we can't always get what we want, but we'll get what we need.[4]\nJimmy Hutmaker of Excelsior, Minnesota, claimed to be the \"Mr. Jimmy\" cited in the song and that he said the phrase \"you can't always get what you want\" to Jagger during a chance encounter at an Excelsior drug store in 1964.[6] However, David Dalton, a writer for Rolling Stone who witnessed the filming of The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, claims in his commentary for the DVD of the concert that \"Mr. Jimmy\" refers to Jimmy Miller, the Stones producer from 1968 to 1973.\nMarianne Faithfull has also claimed a role: \"Obviously I also contributed to 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' and 'Dear Doctor' \u2013 junk songs\u00a0... I know they used me as a muse for those tough drug songs. I knew I was being used but it was for a worthy cause.\"[7]\nThe song was originally released on the B-side of \"Honky Tonk Women\" in July 1969. Although it did not chart at the time, London Records re-serviced the single in 1973 and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" reached number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 34 on the Cashbox Top 100 Singles chart.[8] One of the Stones' most popular recordings, it has since appeared on the compilations Hot Rocks, Singles Collection (single version), Forty Licks, Rolled Gold+: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones (2007 edition), Singles 1968-1971 (single version), Slow Rollers (single version) and GRRR! (single version).\nThe song is also very popular at Rolling Stones shows in part because of its sing-along chorus, and is played at almost every show, where it is customary for Jagger to change the lyrics from \"my favourite flavour, cherry red\" to the question \"What's your favourite flavour?\" to which the audience replies \"Cherry red!\" Live recordings appear on the albums Love You Live, Flashpoint, Live Licks, and Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live, as well as on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, filmed in 1968. Stones concert films that contain the song include: Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones, From the Vault \u2013 L.A Forum - Live in 1975, Let's Spend the Night Together, Stones at the Max, Bridges to Babylon Tour '97\u201398, Four Flicks, The Biggest Bang, and 'Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live.\nThe song was performed live with members of Voce Chamber Choir and London Youth Choir[9] for the Stones' 2012 reunion shows in London, November 25 and November 29. The same choir also performed on the track at Glastonbury and two performances at Hyde Park in 2013.\nDonald Trump played the Rolling Stones' recording of the song at campaign appearances during the 2016 Republican primaries and the presidential election, including his nationally televised acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July.[10] After the convention, the band stated publicly that they do not endorse Trump and requested that he cease all use of their songs immediately.[11] Despite the requests to stop, Trump continued using the song at campaign rallies before and after the 2016 election.[12]\nThe Rolling Stones",

        "text": "The primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4) is a brain region that in humans is located in the dorsal portion of the frontal lobe. It is the primary region of the motor system and works in association with other motor areas including premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, posterior parietal cortex, and several subcortical brain regions, to plan and execute movements. Primary motor cortex is defined anatomically as the region of cortex that contains large neurons known as Betz cells. Betz cells, along with other cortical neurons, send long axons down the spinal cord to synapse onto the interneuron circuitry of the spinal cord and also directly onto the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord which connect to the muscles.\nAt the primary motor cortex, motor representation is orderly arranged (in an inverted fashion) from the toe (at the top of the cerebral hemisphere) to mouth (at the bottom) along a fold in the cortex called the central sulcus. However, some body parts may be controlled by partially overlapping regions of cortex. Each cerebral hemisphere of the primary motor cortex only contains a motor representation of the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. The amount of primary motor cortex devoted to a body part is not proportional to the absolute size of the body surface, but, instead, to the relative density of cutaneous motor receptors on said body part. The density of cutaneous motor receptors on the body part is generally indicative of the necessary degree of precision of movement required at that body part. For this reason, the human hands and face have a much larger representation than the legs.\nFor the discovery of the primary motor cortex and its relationship to other motor cortical areas, see the main article on the motor cortex.\nThe human primary motor cortex is located on the anterior wall of the central sulcus. It also extends anteriorly out of the sulcus partly onto the precentral gyrus. Anteriorly, the primary motor cortex is bordered by a set of areas that lie on the precentral gyrus and that are generally considered to compose the lateral premotor cortex. Posteriorly, the primary motor cortex is bordered by the primary somatosensory cortex, which lies on the posterior wall of the central sulcus. Ventrally the primary motor cortex is bordered by the insular cortex in the lateral sulcus. The primary motor cortex extends dorsally to the top of the hemisphere and then continues onto the medial wall of the hemisphere.\nThe location of the primary motor cortex is most obvious on histological examination due to the presence of the distinctive Betz cells. Layer V of the primary motor cortex contains giant (70-100 \u00c2\u00b5m) pyramidal neurons which are the Betz cells. These neurons send long axons to the contralateral motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and to the lower motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These axons form a part of the corticospinal tract. The Betz cells account for only a small percentage of the corticospinal tract. By some measures they account for about 10% of the primary motor cortex neurons projecting to the spinal cord[1] or about 2-3% of the total cortical projection to the spinal cord.[2] Though the Betz cells do not compose the entire motor output of the cortex, they nonetheless provide a clear marker for the primary motor cortex. This region of cortex, characterized by the presence of Betz cells, was termed area 4 by Brodmann.\nAs the motor axons travel down through the cerebral white matter, they move closer together and form part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule.\nThey continue down into the brainstem, where some of them, after crossing over to the contralateral side, distribute to the cranial nerve motor nuclei. (Note: a few motor fibers synapse with lower motor neurons on the same side of the brainstem).\nAfter crossing over to the contralateral side in the medulla oblongata (pyramidal decussation), the axons travel down the spinal cord as the lateral corticospinal tract.\nFibers that do not cross over in the brainstem travel down the separate ventral corticospinal tract, and most of them cross over to the contralateral side in the spinal cord, shortly before reaching the lower motor neurons.\nBranches of the middle cerebral artery provide most of the arterial blood supply for the primary motor cortex.\nThe medial aspect (leg areas) is supplied by branches of the anterior cerebral artery.\nThere is a broadly somatotopic representation of the different body parts in the primary motor cortex in an arrangement called a motor homunculus (Latin: little person).[3] The leg area is located close to the midline, in interior sections of the motor area folding into the medial longitudinal fissure. The lateral, convex side of the primary motor cortex is arranged from top to bottom in areas that correspond to the buttocks, torso, shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers, thumb, eyelids, lips, and jaw. The arm and hand motor area is the largest, and occupies the part of precentral gyrus between the leg and face area.\nThese areas are not proportional to their size in the body with the lips, face parts, and hands represented by particularly large areas. Following amputation or paralysis, motor areas can shift to adopt new parts of the body.\nThe primary motor cortex receives thalamic inputs from different thalamic nuclei. Among others:\n- Ventral lateral nucleus for cerebellar afferents\n- Ventral anterior nucleus for basal ganglia afferents\nAt least two modifications to the classical somatotopic ordering of body parts have been reported in the primary motor cortex of primates.\nFirst, the arm representation may be organized in a core and surround manner. In the monkey cortex, the digits of the hand are represented in a core area at the posterior edge of the primary motor cortex. This core area is surrounded on three sides (on the dorsal, anterior, and ventral sides) by a representation of the more proximal parts of the arm including the elbow and shoulder.[4][5] In humans, the digit representation is surrounded dorsally, anteriorly, and ventrally, by a representation of the wrist.[6]\nA second modification of the classical somatotopic ordering of body parts is a double representation of the digits and wrist studied mainly in the human motor cortex. One representation lies in a posterior region called area 4p, and the other lies in an anterior region called area 4a. The posterior area can be activated by attention without any sensory feedback and has been suggested to be important for initiation of movements, while the anterior area is dependent on sensory feedback.[7] It can also be activated by imaginary finger movements[8] and listening to speech while making no actual movements. This anterior representation area has been suggested to be important in executing movements involving complex sensoriomotor interactions.[9] It is possible that area 4a in humans corresponds to some parts of the caudal premotor cortex as described in the monkey cortex.\nIn 2009, it was reported, that there are two evolutionary distinct regions, an older one on the outer surface, and a new one found in the cleft. The older one connects to the spinal motorneurons through interneurons in the spinal cord. The newer one, found only in monkeys and apes, connects directly to the spinal motorneurons.[10] The direct connections form after birth, are dominant over the indirect connections, and are more flexible in the circuits they can develop which allows the post-natal learning of complex fine motor skills. \"The emergence of the 'new' M1 region during evolution of the primate lineage is therefore likely to have been important for the enhanced manual dexterity of the human hand.\"[11]\nCertain misconceptions about the primary motor cortex are common in secondary reviews, textbooks, and popular material. Three of the more common misconceptions are listed here.\nOne of the most common misconceptions about the primary motor cortex is that the map of the body is cleanly segregated. Yet it is not a map of individuated muscles or even individuated body parts. The map contains considerable overlap. This overlap increases in more anterior regions of the primary motor cortex. One of the main goals in the history of work on the motor cortex was to determine just how much the different body parts are overlapped or segregated in the motor cortex. Researchers who addressed this issue found that the map of the hand, arm, and shoulder contained extensive overlap.[3][5][6][12][13][14][15][16] Studies that map the precise functional connectivity from cortical neurons to muscles show that even a single neuron in the primary motor cortex can influence the activity of many muscles related to many joints.[12] In experiments on cats and monkeys, as animals learn complex, coordinated movements, the map in the primary motor cortex becomes more overlapping, evidently learning to integrate the control of many muscles.[17][18] In monkeys, when electrical stimulation is applied to the motor cortex on a behavioral timescale, it evokes complex, highly integrated movements such as reaching with the hand shaped to grasp, or bringing the hand to the mouth and opening the mouth.[19][20] This type of evidence suggests that the primary motor cortex, while containing a rough map of the body, may participate in integrating muscles in meaningful ways rather than in segregating the control of individual muscle groups. It has been suggested that a deeper principle of organization may be a map of the statistical correlations in the behavioral repertoire, rather than a map of body parts.[20][21] To the extent that the movement repertoire breaks down partly into the actions of separate body parts, the map contains a rough and overlapping body arrangement.\nThe term \"M1\" and the term \"primary motor cortex\" are often used interchangeably. However, they come from different historical traditions and refer to different divisions of cortex. Some scientists suggested that the motor cortex could be divided into a primary motor strip that was more posterior and a lateral premotor strip that was more anterior. Early researchers who originally proposed this view included Campbell,[22] Vogt and Vogt[23] Foerster,[24] and Fulton.[25] Others suggested that the motor cortex could not be divided in that manner. Instead, in this second view, the so-called primary motor and lateral premotor strips together composed a single cortical area termed M1. A second motor area on the medial wall of the hemisphere was termed M2 or the supplementary motor area. Proponents of this view included Penfield[3] and Woolsey.[26] Today the distinction between the primary motor cortex and the lateral premotor cortex is generally accepted. However, the term M1 is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to the primary motor cortex. Strictly speaking M1 refers to the single map that, according to some previous researchers, encompassed both the primary motor and the lateral premotor cortex.\nThe Betz cells, or giant pyramidal cells in the primary motor cortex, are sometimes mistaken to be the only or main output from the cortex to the spinal cord. This mistake is old, dating back at least to Campbell in 1905.[22] Yet the Betz cells compose only about 2-3% of the neurons that project from the cortex to the spinal cord,[2] and only about 10% of the neurons that project specifically from the primary motor cortex to the spinal cord.[1] A range of cortical areas including the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and even the primary somatosensory cortex, project to the spinal cord. Even when the Betz cells are damaged, the cortex can still communicate to subcortical motor structures and control movement. If the primary motor cortex with its Betz cells is damaged, a temporary paralysis results and other cortical areas can evidently take over some of the lost function.\nLesions of the precentral gyrus result in paralysis of the contralateral side of the body (facial palsy, arm-/leg monoparesis, hemiparesis) - see upper motor neuron.\nEvarts[27] suggested that each neuron in the motor cortex contributes to the force in a muscle. As the neuron becomes active, it sends a signal to the spinal cord, the signal is relayed to a motorneuron, the motorneuron sends a signal to a muscle, and the muscle contracts. The more activity in the motor cortex neuron, the more muscle force.\nGeorgopoulos and colleagues[28][29][30] suggested that muscle force alone was too simple a description. They trained monkeys to reach in various directions and monitored the activity of neurons in the motor cortex. They found that each neuron in the motor cortex was maximally active during a specific direction of reach, and responded less well to neighboring directions of reach. On this basis they suggested that neurons in motor cortex, by \"voting\" or pooling their influences into a \"population code\", could precisely specify a direction of reach.\nThe proposal that motor cortex neurons encode the direction of a reach became controversial. Scott and Kalaska[31] showed that each motor cortex neuron was better correlated with the details of joint movement and muscle force than with the direction of the reach. Schwartz and colleagues[32] showed that motor cortex neurons were well correlated with the speed of the hand. Strick and colleagues[33] found that some neurons in motor cortex were active in association with muscle force and some with the spatial direction of movement. Todorov[34] proposed that the many different correlations are the result of a muscle controller in which many movement parameters happen to be correlated with muscle force.\nThe code by which neurons in the primate motor cortex control the spinal cord, and thus movement, remains debated.\nSome specific progress in understanding how motor cortex causes movement has also been made in the rodent model. The rodent motor cortex, like the monkey motor cortex, may contain subregions that emphasize different common types of actions.[35][36] For example, one region appears to emphasize the rhythmic control of whisking.[35][37][38] Neurons in this region project to a specific subcortical nucleus in which a pattern generator coordinates the cyclic rhythm of the whiskers. This nucleus then projects to the muscles that control the whiskers.\nThe motor tract.",

        "text": "The Meech Lake Accord (French: Accord du lac Meech) was a series of proposed amendments to the Constitution of Canada negotiated in 1987 by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and all 10 Canadian provincial premiers. It was intended to persuade the government of Quebec to symbolically endorse the 1982 constitutional amendments by providing for some decentralization of the Canadian federation.\nThe proposed amendments were initially popular and backed by nearly all political leaders. Concerns about the lack of citizen involvement in the Accord's drafting and its future effects on Canadian federalism were raised by former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, feminist activists, and Aboriginal groups. Support for the Accord began to decline. Changes in government in New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Newfoundland brought to power governments that declined to accept the Accord. Further negotiations were conducted but tension increased between Quebec and the predominantly English-speaking provinces.\nA dramatic final meeting among first ministers a month before the Accord's constitutionally mandated deadline seemed to show renewed agreement on a second series of amendments that would address the concerns raised in the intervening debates. Despite this, the original accord would not gain acceptance in the Manitoba or Newfoundland legislatures in time for ratification.\nFailure to pass the Accord greatly increased tensions between Quebec and the remainder of the country. The Quebec sovereignty movement gained renewed support for a time. The general aims of the Accord would be addressed in the Charlottetown Accord, which failed to gain passage in a referendum.\nIn 1981, negotiations led by Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau to patriate the constitution reached an agreement that formed the basis of the Constitution Act, 1982. Quebec Premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and the Quebec National Assembly refused to approve the amendments and announced it would use a constitutional veto. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Quebec Veto Reference that Quebec did not have a veto, and the Constitution Act, 1982, was operative in Quebec.\nIn the 1984 election, the Progressive Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, committed to eventually allowing the National Assembly to accept the amendments \"with honour and enthusiasm\", winning a majority government. The apparent lessening of tension prompted L\u00e9vesque to attempt the \"beau risque\" of federal cooperation. His government split, leading to his resignation and the ultimate defeat of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois by the federalist Quebec Liberal Party, led by Robert Bourassa.\nBourassa, in his 1985 election platform, outlined five conditions that would have to be met for Quebec to \"sign on\" to the constitution.[1] They were: recognition of Quebec's distinct character (as primarily Catholic and French-speaking), a veto for Quebec in Constitutional matters, input by Quebec into the appointment of Supreme Court justices, entrenchment of Quebec's role in immigration,[clarification needed] and a limit on the Federal spending power.[1] Bourassa considered the demands practical, as all elements of the conditions had previously been offered by the Federal government to Quebec on different occasions.[1]\nBourassa and Mulroney, both pragmatic pro-business figures, had a far more congenial relationship than had Trudeau and L\u00c3\u00a9vesque. Mulroney tasked Senator Lowell Murray with coordinating a possible agreement with the provinces.[2] Bourassa announced that talks could proceed based on the five conditions, adding only the provision that \"recognition of Quebec's distinct character\" had to be an interpretive clause rather than a symbolic note in a revised preamble.[citation needed][note 1]\nAt a meeting of the \"First Ministers\" in Edmonton in August 1986, the Premiers and Mulroney agreed to the \"Edmonton Declaration\". It stated that a \"Quebec Round\" of constitutional talks based on the five conditions would occur before further reforms would be undertaken.[3]\nBelieving that a constitutional agreement was possible, Mulroney called a conference for April 30, 1987, with provincial premiers at Willson House, Meech Lake, in the Gatineau Hills.[4] In contrast to previous constitutional conferences, which tended to feature a multitude of bureaucrats and advisors, the 11 \"first ministers\" were the only participants at the bargaining table. Other officials were kept downstairs and the media was locked out of the negotiation process.[5]\nMulroney chaired the meeting, and agreement came quickly on the Supreme Court and immigration conditions, both of which were significantly an entrenchment of the status quo.[6] The only agenda item added besides Quebec's conditions was senate reform. After initially proposing abolition, Mulroney agreed to allow appointment from lists created by the provinces while awaiting further reform, which was accepted by the provinces.[6] Changes to the amending formula and recognition of a distinct society were the most contentious issues. Changes to the wording of the \"distinct society clause\" that also preserved rights for English and French minorities in other provinces gained acceptance by all representatives at the table.[7]\nAfter nine hours, the Premiers and Mulroney announced a consensus for constitutional reform had been reached amongst the First Ministers. The consensus would encompass five main modifications to the Canadian constitution:[8]\nThe initial reaction of the public was shock. Interest groups that had been involved in the constitutional debate, unaware that an agreement was practicable, had not thought to begin agitating for consultation. They were caught off balance by the accepted Accord.[9] The only province to have public hearings after the Accord stage and before the legal text was drafted was Quebec.[10]\nNational public opinion polls initially showed that a majority of Canadians supported the proposed agreement.[11] Liberal Party leader John Turner and New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent announced their agreement with the consensus.[10]\nThe first prominent opposition, as reported by the media, was from former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who had led the effort for drafting and approval of the 1982 constitution. In an open letter published in both the Toronto Star and Le Devoir on May 26, 1987, Trudeau attacked the Accord as a capitulation to provincialism and the end of any dream of \"One Canada\". Portraying \"patriation\" as the equalization of the bargaining power of Federal and provincial governments that would allow Canada to survive indefinitely, Trudeau wrote that the new agreement made further devolution of powers inevitable. He referred to Mulroney as a \"weakling,\" the Premiers as \"snivelers,\" and invoked Bourassa's previous reneging of the Victoria Charter as suggesting that the Accord would be the beginning of concessions to Quebec and provincial interests.[12]\nTrudeau's well-known position as an ardent Federalist and a prominent Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois helped express the opposition to the Accord for many of its opponents. He generated concerns with the Accord in other groups that had embraced the Charter, such as First Nations ethnic communities and women.[13] His position created turmoil in the Federal and provincial Liberal parties, with the federal party split largely on linguistic lines, shaking John Turner's already fragile leadership.[14]\nAs the final agreement was to be drawn up in Ottawa on June 2, 1987, Trudeau's intervention had made him, in the words of Mulroney advisor L. Ian Macdonald, a \"twelfth participant\".[15] The meeting, seen as a formality to precede a signing ceremony the next day, instead lasted 19 hours.[16]\nManitoba NDP Premier Howard Pawley, faced with left-wing opposition to the consensus in his home province, insisted on more limited language regarding Federal spending power in the final agreement.[17] Ontario Premier David Peterson, as the sole Liberal at the table, did not have support for it by most of his caucus (including his main adviser, Ian Scott). They opposed the consensus, and proposed a variety of amendments to the federal spending power and the distinct society clauses.[14] Pawley and Peterson agreed to follow each other's lead or back out together, to avoid either being seen as the cause of the collapse of talk.[18] They asked Mulroney to take a harder line on Federal powers.[10]\nTrudeau's intervention had also created a separate backlash: Mulroney and the other eight Premiers, insulted by what they saw as undue interference, aggressively embraced the previous consensus.[10] Bourassa in particular refused to move away from any of the Accord's major provisions.[19] Negotiations went on through the night. They ultimately agreed on a clause promising that \"the distinct society clause\" would not derogate the Charter, providing protections for multicultural and aboriginal rights, and tighter language regarding the Federal spending power.[20]\nAt a final roll call at 4:45AM, hours before the signing ceremony, Mulroney knowingly breached convention by taking the vote in reverse order around the table instead of the traditional order of a province's entry into confederation.[20] Pawley, after pressure from federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent, conceded and approved the agreement.[21] Peterson, the last to vote in this improvised formula, approved the final agreement on behalf of Ontario.[20]\nAt the symbolic signing ceremony, the Premiers signed the Accord. Bourassa declared that Quebec had become reintegrated in Canada to a standing ovation.[22]\nSupporters of the Accord argued that it would provide a generation of constitutional peace and do so in a simple and understandable way without major structural changes to the Federal government or the Canadian federation. Bourassa described Quebec's exclusion from the 1982 agreement as a \"hole in the heart\" that had to be mended before Quebec could become a normalized participant in constitutional matters.[23] Mulroney and others, acknowledging that the agreement focused on primarily Quebec concerns, described the agreement as a \"bridge\" that, once accepted, would allow for further negotiations with other groups to proceed with Quebec's full participation.\nMulroney argued that the Senate and Supreme Court reforms would allow for greater involvement of other parties in what was generally a unilateral decision from the Prime Minister. It was an attempt to reduce what was seen as an overly powerful Prime Minister's Office.[6] Mulroney would tell the Toronto Star, \"You can have the old style of warring federalism, or you can have genuine co-operative federalism, on which we're trying to build a new country.\"[24]\nProponents such as constitutional expert Peter Hogg said that the \"distinct society\" clause was merely an \"affirmation of a sociological fact\".[25] Chief Justice Brian Dickson noted that court decisions had for decades taken Quebec's \"character\" into consideration on a standard basis.[12]\nOpponents of the Accord took issue with both the process and ultimate results of the negotiations. Process objections focused on the agreement being negotiated in circumstances considered to be opaque and undemocratic: the amendments were effectively drafted and agreed to by the eleven Premiers themselves in two meetings and were presented to their legislatures as a fait accompli. Some academics described the Accord as resulting from an exercise in \"elite accommodation\" not compatible with a more democratic Canada.[26] Aside from Quebec, no province held public hearings on the Accord until opposition began to sprout.\nSome critics said that \"distinct society\" focus unbalanced the Federation, creating a \"special status\" for Quebec that would lead to asymmetrical federalism and the possible decline of the English-speaking community in Quebec and Francophones elsewhere in Canada. Aboriginal, feminist, and minority groups worried that the clause could be interpreted by courts to allow the Quebec government to disregard sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and of other constitutional protections in the name of preserving the province's culture.\nAboriginal groups were opposed to the amendments that involved constitutional change, as they had not had any representation in negotiations.[27]\nFormer Prime Minister Trudeau and similar critics argued that the further devolution of powers was unnecessary and did not result in any \"trade-off\" with the Federal government. Rather, the Accord reduced its ability to speak for all Canadians on matters of national interest.\nWestern and Atlantic Canada particularly objected to the lack of more substantive reforms in how the Senate membership was chosen, especially as the Accord required further Senate reform to be subject to unanimous approval by the provinces.\nOn the other hand, activists seeking sovereignty for Quebec were also unhappy; they generally opposed the agreement, believing that \"recognition of Quebec as a distinct society\" would be only moderately useful. They thought acceptance of the agreement would forestall devolution of further powers.\nBecause the agreement would have changed the constitution's amending formula, it needed to obtain the consent of all provincial and federal legislatures within three years. The signatory Premiers undertook to have Accord approved as soon as possible. Quebec passed the Accord on June 23, 1987, triggering the three year time limit provided for by the Section 39(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982; this meant that June 22, 1990, would be the last possible day the Accord could pass. Saskatchewan ratified the Accord on September 23, 1987, and Alberta did likewise on December 7, 1987.[28]\nAfter the conclusion of public hearings, New Brunswick premier Richard Hatfield was unable, despite significant pressure from Mulroney, to put the Accord to the floor of the provincial legislature.[29] Hatfield's government lost every seat in the October 1987 New Brunswick election to the Frank McKenna-led Liberals. McKenna had campaigned on requesting changes to the Accord, especially for protections for New Brunswick's linguistic duality, and demanded changes before passing the Accord in New Brunswick. The unanimous provincial consensus was now gone, and with it much of the Accord's political momentum.\nMore surprising was the unexpected defeat of Howard Pawley's NDP majority government in Manitoba after a disgruntled backbencher voted against the government, prompting an election in April 1988. The result was a PC minority government under Gary Filmon that was tacitly supported by Gary Doer's NDP.[30] The leader of the opposition, Liberal Sharon Carstairs, was a fervent opponent of the Accord, and was convinced some dissident PCs and NDP MLAs could be convinced to vote it down.[31] The unstable confidence situation meant that all three leaders would have to negotiate on Manitoba's behalf.[32]\nTrudeau was invited to both the Commons and Senate committee hearings to discuss the Accord, with his later Senate appearance lasting several hours. The Senate, the majority of whose members had been appointed by Trudeau, rejected the Accord, prompting the House of Commons to use s.47 of the Constitution Act, 1982, to pass the amendment without the Senate's consent.\nThe Accord played very little role in the 1988 Federal election, as all three parties supported the Accord and the Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement was the dominant issue. Bourassa's Liberals, who supported free trade, lent tacit support to the federal Progressive Conservatives and their campaign in favour of the agreement. This support was later speculated to have been a cause of a disconnect between left wing intellectuals and support for the Accord,[33] and was cited by the Manitoba NDP for their more lukewarm attitude toward the amendments after Pawley's retirement.[30]\nShortly after the election, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on Ford v. Quebec, a compendium of cases regarding sign restrictions in the Charter of the French Language. While acknowledging the protection of Quebec's French identity as a pressing and substantial objective, the Court ruled that the outright ban on English-language signs was a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and ordered the language restrictions be struck down.[34]\nThe decision reignited the long-simmering debate over language use in Quebec: while English-language groups celebrated the decision, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and nationalist groups demanded Bourassa use the notwithstanding clause to uphold the Charter of the French Language against the court ruling. Both Mulroney and Peterson pressured Bourassa not to use the notwithstanding clause,[35] while prominent Quebec cabinet minister and nationalist Claude Ryan threatened to resign if the clause was not used.[35]\nBourassa opted to propose Bill 178, which continued the sign ban on outdoor signs and used the clause, causing four of his English-speaking ministers to resign and prompting general outrage in English Canada.[36] Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon, calling the move a violation of the \"spirit of Meech Lake\", immediately ordered that public hearings regarding the Accord be ended and the Accord be withdrawn from consideration pending a new constitutional conference, officially joining New Brunswick in opposing the Accord.[37] John Turner and the federal Liberals, who had gained little traction in Quebec from their pro-Meech stance in the previous election, attacked Mulroney for what was seen as Federal acquiescence to and, in the case of Lucien Bouchard and Louis Plamondon, approval of Bill 178.[37]\nThe Accord would gain a third opponent after the 1989 Newfoundland election, which saw PC premier Tom Rideout defeated by the Liberal Clyde Wells. Wells had campaigned against the Accord, as he was opposed to changing the amending formula before senate reform, the restrictions on the Federal spending power, and felt that distinct society would be used by Quebec to gain special status in confederation. Wells demanded a re-opening of the Accord. A conference held in November 1989 failed to break the logjam, and featured a bitter argument on national television between Wells and Mulroney.[38][39]\nAs the political discourse moved from the contents of the Accord to the possible results of its demise, palpable tension arose between English and French speakers throughout Canada, including outside of Quebec.[40] Using Bourassa's use of the notwithstanding clause as justification, groups such as the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada convinced municipalities such as Sault Ste. Marie to pass bylaws outlawing the provision of French language services.[41] A video clip of protesters stomping a Quebec flag in Brockville, Ontario was replayed frequently on Quebec television to symbolize English Canada's opposition to the Accord.[40]\nThe Accord required passage in Manitoba, New Brunswick, and, after Wells used s. 46(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, to revoke the province's previous assent, Newfoundland.[38]\nHope for the Accord gained momentum after New Brunswick proposed a series of alternate concerns that would have to be addressed to enable passage of the original agreement. Jean Charest, a former cabinet minister, was tasked with heading a commission on addressing New Brunswick's concerns on March 22, 1990, which expanded into an attempt to forge an all-party consensus on the Accord.[42] Despite his opposition, leading Liberal leadership candidate Jean Chr\u00c3\u00a9tien, wishing the issue to be off the table, contributed to the commission via a back channel.[clarification needed][43] On May 17, 1990, the commission recommended a companion accord that would be approved by all provinces along with Meech Lake; This would permit the original accord to stay in place, saving face for Quebec and the federal government, while addressing the concerns of other provinces.[42] The companion Accord asserted that the distinct society clause would be subject to the Charter and would feature greater protections for minority language rights in the provinces.[42]\nBourassa dismissed the report the day it was released.[42] Anger at reading its contents in Paris prompted Lucien Bouchard, environment minister and Mulroney's Quebec lieutenant, to send a telegram to a gathering in his native Alma lavishly praising the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque to be read by PQ leader Jacques Parizeau.[43]\nUpon his return to Canada, Mulroney demanded Bouchard clarify the remark or resign, and Bouchard supplied a lengthy letter of resignation on May 22, 1990.[44] The two men, who had been close friends since attending Laval University together, never spoke again.[45] Bouchard sat as an independent. He made a speech in defence of the original Meech accord and stated that without it, sovereignty was the only option.[45][46] Bourassa announced his support of Bouchard's action from the National Assembly, and said it provided a clear warning to English Canada of what would occur if Meech failed.[45]\nOn June 3, 1990, after each Premier met individually with the Prime Minister at 24 Sussex Drive, the First Ministers met at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull.[47] Scheduled as a one-day meeting, the premiers instead met for a week at the National Conference Centre and the Government Conference Centre. The combined media presence outside lent to an atmosphere of chaos and drama, with repeated intonations by Mulroney and other Federal officials that acceptance of the accord was necessary for the very survival of Canada.[47][48] As the process wore on, journalists noted that the secrecy and spin began to echo the original meetings that had created problems in the first place.[49] Historian Michael Bliss described the spectacle as \"nauseating\".[50]\nAfter a first day that was unsuccessful, McKenna attempted to start conversation by announcing that New Brunswick would support the Accord.[38] The second day saw Filmon agree to a second accord being enacted a number of months after the original passed, allowing for all sides to show more flexibility.[51]\nAt the meeting, Bourassa conceded that a second accord could be adopted that included a guarantee that distinct society would not weaken gender equality and give the territories involvement in the appointment of senators and Supreme Court justices.[52] The Premiers also agreed to hold future conferences on Aboriginal and minority language issues, the creation of a \"Canada Clause\" to guide judicial decisions in the same manner as \"distinct society\", a new process for how new provinces would be formed, and a new amending procedure.[52]\nWells, however, was still not satisfied with the proposed conditions, and threatened to walk out of the conference. After being physically stopped by Alberta Premier Don Getty, he was asked what his conditions were for acceptance, and Wells replied that he needed a guarantee that senate reform would be carried out.[53] The Ontario delegation then proposed a new formula: A clause would be placed in the new accord for senate reform negotiations to continue to 1995. If negotiations failed by 1995, Ontario would agree to give up 6 Senate seats, meaning that Quebec would have 24 seats, Ontario 18, Prince Edward Island 4, and the remaining provinces 8.[53] Wells immediately agreed in principle.[54]\nThe next day, another signing ceremony was held, but Wells protested that the draft agreement had deleted a request that a 10-year review be conducted on the distinct society clause without informing him.[54] The clause was never seriously considered by Federal negotiators who, thinking it would be a poison pill for Quebec, had never brought it to Bourassa's attention.[54] Wells put an asterisk next to his signature, but promised that the Accord would be put before the Newfoundland House of Assembly or to a referendum.[55]\nThe apparent success of the negotiations was offset by a severe public relations blunder the following day: Mulroney, when describing the negotiation process to The Globe and Mail, stated that he had intentionally waited until the last minute to put pressure on the attendees for the final meeting, which would allow him to \"roll the dice\" and force the deal to go through.[56][57]\nSusan Delacourt reported Mulroney's remark, which prompted general outrage in both the political class and in the public for its apparently flippant nature, which contrasted heavily with Mulroney's somber language and remarks about the necessity of the Accord passing during the previous conference.[57] Filmon and Wells both expressed their displeasure with the remark, and Filmon declared that, while he would place the Accord in front of the Manitoba legislature, he would not exempt the Accord from public hearing requirements.[58] Liberal leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien, who had been considering endorsing the Accords, backed off after the remark.[59] Peterson believes that the remark killed any chance of the Accord passing.[60][note 2]\nWells had determined that a referendum was impractical in the short time period, and arranged for the Accord to be put to a free vote in the Newfoundland House of Assembly, with himself opposing ratification.[61] In a highly unusual maneuver, Mulroney, Peterson, and McKenna addressed the House of Assembly and urged them to accept the Accord.[62]\nOn the final day ratification was possible, June 22, 1990, unanimous support was still required to bypass the necessary public consultations in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly and proceed with ratification. Elijah Harper raised an eagle feather to mark his dissension, on the grounds that Aboriginal groups had not been consulted on either Accord. As the amendment could not proceed, Filmon contacted Wells in Newfoundland and advised that the Amendment would not reach the floor.[63]\nAccordingly, Clyde Wells and opposition leader Tom Rideout agreed to cancel the planned free vote in the Newfoundland House of Assembly, because the outcome would have most likely been a refusal.[62] Peterson, Mulroney, and McKenna argue that Wells undertook to put the Accord to a vote before the ratification deadline, but Wells disagreed with that interpretation.[62]\nPursuant to Section 39(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, on June 23, 1990, the amendments lapsed. They had received the assent of the federal government and eight provinces totaling 96% of the population.[14]\nIn a speech to the National Assembly of Quebec delivered the next day, Bourassa captured the nationalist sentiment of the moment:\n\u00ab\u00a0Le Canada anglais doit comprendre de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s claire que, quoi qu'on dise et quoi qu'on fasse, le Qu\u00e9bec est, aujourd'hui et pour toujours, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 distincte, libre et capable d'assumer son destin et son d\u00e9veloppement.\u00a0\u00bb\n...\u00c2\u00a0English Canada must clearly understand that, no matter what is said or done, Quebec is, today and forever, a distinct society, free and able to assume control of its destiny and development.\nJacques Parizeau, leader of the opposition, crossed the floor to shake Bourassa's hand and referred to him as \"my Premier\".[64] On June 25, an estimated 500,000 Quebecers marched in the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day celebrations in Quebec City, during which actor Jean Duceppe delivered a speech calling for independence. Polls at this time showed a majority of 61\u201364% in favour of sovereignty-association.[64] Bourassa, in an attempt to constructively capture nationalist sentiment, declared he would negotiate only with the Federal government, and later passed Bill 150, which promised a referendum by October 26, 1992, on a revised constitutional agreement or sovereignty for Quebec.[65] Despite these initiatives, Bourassa remained privately committed to federalism, believing that sovereignty, while possible, was unworkable.[66]\nBouchard and other alienated Quebec MPs united to form the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois under his leadership.[citation needed]\nOntario Premier David Peterson had, reluctantly, played a prominent role in creating the accord and continued to support it in the face of growing opposition. This led to a backlash in his own province, especially regarding his promise to provide Senate seats to other provinces. He was defeated by Bob Rae's NDP within months in a snap election.\nIn response to criticism of the Accord, British Columbia and Alberta enacted legislation requiring future constitutional amendments to be put to a referendum before being approved by the legislature.\nMulroney's popularity plummeted. Many condemned his handling of the accord, and the exhaustive and interminable debates over it caused a backlash against further constitutional negotiations. In November 1990, Mulroney sought the input of Canadians on the country's constitutional future by convening the Citizen's Forum on National Unity. The forum was more commonly known as the Spicer Commission, after its chair, Keith Spicer.\nA variety of constitutional conferences and the efforts of former Prime Minister Joe Clark resulted in the Charlottetown Accord, which contained many of the same proposals, along with concrete involvement of First Nations groups. The Charlottetown Accord, unlike Meech Lake, was put to referenda (on October 26, 1992), but it was also defeated in most provinces, including Quebec. Following these attempts to make further amendments to the Constitution have been recognized as extremely difficult. No serious attempt has been made in the two decades since to alter the Constitution.",

        "text": "The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer, pronounced [b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0250 \u02c8ma\u028a\u032f\u0250]\u00a0(\u00a0listen)) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989.[1] Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), starting on 13 August 1961, the Wall cut off (by land) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989.[2] Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992.[3] The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls,[4] accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \"death strip\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, \"fakir beds\" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the \"will of the people\" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.[5]\nGDR authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall), by implication equating the NATO countries (and West Germany in particular) with fascists. The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the \"Wall of Shame\", a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement.[6] Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came to symbolize physically the \"Iron Curtain\" that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.[5]\nBefore the Wall's erection, 3.5\u00c2\u00a0million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin; from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989 the Wall prevented almost all such emigration.[7] During this period over 100,000[5] people attempted to escape and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall, with an estimated death toll ranging from 136[8] to more than 200[9][5] in and around Berlin.\nIn 1989 a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries\u2014Poland and Hungary in particular\u2014caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall.[10] After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left.[5]\nA fact standing out from the events leading up to the night of November 9, 1989 is that this is an historical example of a dictatorial regime being overcome by a \"peaceful civil resistance movement\".[11]\nContrary to popular belief, the Wall's actual demolition did not begin officially until the summer of 1990 and continued until 1992.[1] The \"fall of the Berlin Wall\" paved the way for German reunification, which formally took place on 3 October 1990.[5]\nAfter the end of World War II in Europe, what remained of pre-war Germany west of the Oder-Neisse line was divided into four occupation zones (as per the Potsdam Agreement), each one controlled by one of the four occupying Allied powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. The capital of Berlin, as the seat of the Allied Control Council, was similarly subdivided into four sectors despite the city's location, which was fully within the Soviet zone.[12]\nWithin two years, political divisions increased between the Soviets and the other occupying powers. These included the Soviets' refusal to agree to reconstruction plans making post-war Germany self-sufficient and to a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.[13] France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Benelux countries later met to combine the non-Soviet zones of the country into one zone for reconstruction and to approve the extension of the Marshall Plan.[5]\nFollowing World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin headed a group of nations on his Western border, the Eastern Bloc, that then included Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which he wished to maintain alongside a weakened Soviet-controlled Germany.[14] As early as 1945, Stalin revealed to German communist leaders that he expected to slowly undermine the British position within the British occupation zone, that the United States would withdraw within a year or two, and that nothing would then stand in the way of a united communist Germany within the bloc.[15]\nThe major task of the ruling communist party in the Soviet zone was to channel Soviet orders down to both the administrative apparatus and the other bloc parties, which in turn would be presented as internal measures.[16] Property and industry was nationalized in the East German zone.[17][18] If statements or decisions deviated from the described line, reprimands and (for persons outside public attention) punishment would ensue, such as imprisonment, torture and even death.[16]\nIndoctrination of Marxism-Leninism became a compulsory part of school curricula, sending professors and students fleeing to the West. The East Germans created an elaborate political police apparatus that kept the population under close surveillance,[19] including Soviet SMERSH secret police.[17]\nIn 1948, following disagreements regarding reconstruction and a new German currency, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin.[20] The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began a massive \"airlift\", supplying West Berlin with food and other supplies.[21] The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the Western policy change. Communists attempted to disrupt the elections of 1948, preceding large losses therein,[22] while 300,000 Berliners demonstrated for the international airlift to continue.[23] In May 1949, Stalin lifted the blockade, permitting the resumption of Western shipments to Berlin.[24][25]\nThe German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was declared on 7 October 1949. By a secret treaty, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs accorded the East German state administrative authority, but not autonomy. The Soviets permeated East German administrative, military and secret police structures and had full control.[26][27]\nEast Germany differed from West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany), which developed into a Western capitalist country with a social market economy (\"Soziale Marktwirtschaft\" in German) and a democratic parliamentary government. Continual economic growth starting in the 1950s fuelled a 20-year \"economic miracle\" (\"Wirtschaftswunder\"). As West Germany's economy grew, and its standard of living steadily improved, many East Germans wanted to move to West Germany.[28]\nAfter the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas of the Eastern Bloc aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave.[29] Taking advantage of the zonal border between occupied zones in Germany, the number of GDR citizens moving to West Germany totaled 187,000 in 1950; 165,000 in 1951; 182,000 in 1952; and 331,000 in 1953.[30][31] One reason for the sharp 1953 increase was fear of potential further Sovietization, given the increasingly paranoid actions of Joseph Stalin in late 1952 and early 1953.[32] 226,000 had fled in just the first six months of 1953.[33]\nBy the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement, restricting emigration, was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany.[34] The restrictions presented a quandary for some Eastern Bloc states, which had been more economically advanced and open than the Soviet Union, such that crossing borders seemed more natural\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially where no prior border existed between East and West Germany.[35]\nUp until 1952, the demarcation lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places.[36] On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that the East Germans should \"introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents\" in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that \"The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives.\"[37]\nConsequently, the inner German border between the two German states was closed, and a barbed-wire fence erected. The border between the Western and Eastern sectors of Berlin, however, remained open, although traffic between the Soviet and the Western sectors was somewhat restricted. This resulted in Berlin becoming a magnet for East Germans desperate to escape life in the GDR, and also a flashpoint for tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.[5]\nIn 1955, the Soviets gave East Germany authority over civilian movement in Berlin, passing control to a regime not recognized in the West.[38] Initially, East Germany granted \"visits\" to allow its residents access to West Germany. However, following the defection of large numbers of East Germans under this regime, the new East German state legally restricted virtually all travel to the West in 1956.[36] Soviet East German ambassador Mikhail Pervukhin observed that \"the presence in Berlin of an open and essentially uncontrolled border between the socialist and capitalist worlds unwittingly prompts the population to make a comparison between both parts of the city, which unfortunately does not always turn out in favour of Democratic [East] Berlin.\"[39]\nWith the closing of the inner German border officially in 1952,[39] the border in Berlin remained considerably more accessible then because it was administered by all four occupying powers.[36] Accordingly, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West.[40] On 11 December 1957, East Germany introduced a new passport law that reduced the overall number of refugees leaving Eastern Germany.[5]\nIt had the unintended result of drastically increasing the percentage of those leaving through West Berlin from 60% to well over 90% by the end of 1958.[39] Those caught trying to leave East Berlin were subjected to heavy penalties, but with no physical barrier and subway train access still available to West Berlin, such measures were ineffective.[41] The Berlin sector border was essentially a \"loophole\" through which Eastern Bloc citizens could still escape.[39] The 3.5\u00c2\u00a0million East Germans who had left by 1961 totalled approximately 20% of the entire East German population.[41]\nAn important reason that Crossing the inner German border was not stopped earlier was that doing so would cut off much of the railway traffic in East Germany. Construction of a new railway bypassing West Berlin, the Berlin outer ring, commenced in 1951. Following the completion of the railway in 1961, closing the border became a more practical proposition. (See History of rail transport in Germany.)\nThe emigrants tended to be young and well-educated, leading to the \"brain drain\" feared by officials in East Germany.[29] Yuri Andropov, then the CPSU Director on Relations with Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, wrote an urgent letter on 28 August 1958, to the Central Committee about the significant 50% increase in the number of East German intelligentsia among the refugees.[42] Andropov reported that, while the East German leadership stated that they were leaving for economic reasons, testimony from refugees indicated that the reasons were more political than material.[42] He stated \"the flight of the intelligentsia has reached a particularly critical phase.\"[42]\nAn East German SED propaganda booklet published in 1955 dramatically described the serious nature of 'flight from the republic':\nBoth from the moral standpoint as well as in terms of the interests of the whole German nation, leaving the GDR is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity.\nThose who let themselves be recruited objectively serve West German Reaction and militarism, whether they know it or not. Is it not despicable when for the sake of a few alluring job offers or other false promises about a \"guaranteed future\" one leaves a country in which the seed for a new and more beautiful life is sprouting, and is already showing the first fruits, for the place that favours a new war and destruction?\nIs it not an act of political depravity when citizens, whether young people, workers, or members of the intelligentsia, leave and betray what our people have created through common labour in our republic to offer themselves to the American or British secret services or work for the West German factory owners, Junkers, or militarists? Does not leaving the land of progress for the morass of an historically outdated social order demonstrate political backwardness and blindness? ...\n[W]orkers throughout Germany will demand punishment for those who today leave the German Democratic Republic, the strong bastion of the fight for peace, to serve the deadly enemy of the German people, the imperialists and militarists.[43]\nBy 1960, the combination of World War II and the massive emigration westward left East Germany with only 61% of its population of working age, compared to 70.5% before the war. The loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals: engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers and skilled workers. The direct cost of manpower losses to East Germany (and corresponding gain to the West) has been estimated at $7\u00a0billion to $9\u00a0billion, with East German party leader Walter Ulbricht later claiming that West Germany owed him $17\u00a0billion in compensation, including reparations as well as manpower losses.[41] In addition, the drain of East Germany's young population potentially cost it over 22.5\u00a0billion marks in lost educational investment.[44] The brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany that the re-securing of the German communist frontier was imperative.[45]\nThe exodus of emigrants from East Germany presented two minor potential benefits: an easy opportunity to smuggle East German secret agents to West Germany, and a reduction in the number of citizens hostile to the communist regime. Neither of these advantages, however, proved particularly useful.[46]\nOn 15 June 1961, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party and GDR State Council chairman Walter Ulbricht stated in an international press conference, \"Niemand hat die Absicht, eine Mauer zu errichten!\" (No one has the intention of erecting a wall!). \"It was the first time the colloquial term Mauer (wall) had been used in this context\".[47]\nThe transcript of a telephone call between Nikita Khrushchev and Ulbricht on 1 August in the same year, suggests that the initiative for the construction of the Wall came from Khrushchev.[48][49] However, other sources suggest that Khrushchev had initially been wary about building a wall, fearing negative Western reaction. What is beyond dispute, though, is that Ulbricht had pushed for a border closure for quite some time, arguing that East Germany's very existence was at stake.[50]\nKhrushchev had become emboldened upon seeing US President John F. Kennedy's youth and inexperience show as weakness against Khrushchev's brutal, undiplomatic aggression. This feeling of miscalculation and failure is admitted by Kennedy in the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence with New York Times columnist James \"Scotty\" Reston.[51] Kennedy made the regrettable error of admitting that the US would not actively oppose this action in the Soviet sector of Berlin.[52] On Saturday, 12 August 1961, the leaders of the GDR attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in D\u00f6llnsee, in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin. There Ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a wall.[5]\nAt midnight, the police and units of the East German army began to close the border and, by Sunday morning, 13 August, the border with West Berlin was closed. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the border to make them impassable to most vehicles and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the 156 kilometres (97\u00a0mi) around the three western sectors, and the 43 kilometres (27\u00a0mi) that divided West and East Berlin.[53] The date of 13 August became commonly referred to as Barbed Wire Sunday in Germany.[5]\nThe barrier was built inside East Berlin or East German territory to ensure that it did not encroach on West Berlin at any point. Generally, the Wall was only slightly inside East Berlin, but in a few places it was some distance from the legal border, most notably at Potsdamer Bahnhof[54] and the Lenn\u00c3\u00a9 Triangle[55] that is now much of the Potsdamer Platz development.\nLater, the initial barrier was built up into the Wall proper, the first concrete elements and large blocks being put in place on 17 August. During the construction of the Wall, National People's Army (NVA) and Combat Groups of the Working Class (KdA) soldiers stood in front of it with orders to shoot anyone who attempted to defect. Additionally, chain fences, walls, minefields and other obstacles were installed along the length of East Germany's western border with West Germany proper. A huge no man's land was cleared to provide a clear line of fire at fleeing refugees.[56]\nWith the closing of the East-West sector boundary in Berlin, the vast majority of East Germans could no longer travel or emigrate to West Germany. Berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult.[57] Many families were split, while East Berliners employed in the West were cut off from their jobs. West Berlin became an isolated exclave in a hostile land. West Berliners demonstrated against the Wall, led by their Mayor (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister) Willy Brandt, who strongly criticized the United States for failing to respond. Allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees, but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city. In 1961, Secretary of State Dean Rusk proclaimed, \"The Wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the European landscape. I see no reason why the Soviet Union should think it is\u2014it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to communist failure.\"[56]\nUnited States and UK sources had expected the Soviet sector to be sealed off from West Berlin, but were surprised by how long the East Germans took for such a move. They considered the Wall as an end to concerns about a GDR/Soviet retaking or capture of the whole of Berlin; the Wall would presumably have been an unnecessary project if such plans were afloat. Thus they concluded that the possibility of a Soviet military conflict over Berlin had decreased.[58]\nThe East German government claimed that the Wall was an \"anti-fascist protective rampart\" (German: \"antifaschistischer Schutzwall\") intended to dissuade aggression from the West.[59] Another official justification was the activities of Western agents in Eastern Europe.[60] The Eastern German government also claimed that West Berliners were buying out state-subsidized goods in East Berlin. East Germans and others greeted such statements with skepticism, as most of the time, the border was only closed for citizens of East Germany traveling to the West, but not for residents of West Berlin travelling to the East.[61] The construction of the Wall had caused considerable hardship to families divided by it. Most people believed that the Wall was mainly a means of preventing the citizens of East Germany from entering or fleeing to West Berlin.[62]\nThe National Security Agency was the only American intelligence agency that was aware that East Germany was to take action to deal with the brain drain problem. On 9 August 1961, the NSA intercepted an advance warning information of the Socialist Unity Party's plan to close the intra-Berlin border between East and West Berlin completely for foot traffic. The interagency intelligence Berlin Watch Committee assessed that this intercept \"might be the first step in a plan to close the border.\"[63][64] This warning did not reach U.S. President John F. Kennedy until noon on 13 August 1961, while he was vacationing in his yacht off the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. While Kennedy was angry that he had no advance warning, he was relieved that the East Germans and the Soviets had only divided Berlin without taking any action against West Berlin's access to the West. However, he denounced the Berlin Wall, whose erection worsened the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.[63][64]\nIn response to the erection of the Berlin Wall, a retired general, Lucius D. Clay, was appointed by Kennedy as his special advisor and sent to Berlin with ambassadorial rank. Clay had been the Military Governor of the US Zone of Occupation in Germany during the period of the Berlin Blockade and had ordered the first measures in what became the Berlin Airlift. He was immensely popular with the residents of West Berlin, and his appointment was an unambiguous sign that Kennedy would not compromise on the status of West Berlin. Clay and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson arrived at Tempelhof Airport on the afternoon of Saturday, 19 August 1961.[5]\nThey arrived in a city defended by three Allied brigades\u2014one each from the UK, the US, and France (the Forces Fran\u00e7aises \u00e0 Berlin). On 16 August, Kennedy had given the order for them to be reinforced. Early on 19 August, the 1st Battle Group, 18th Infantry (commanded by Colonel Glover S. Johns Jr.) was alerted.[65]\nOn Sunday morning, U.S. troops marched from West Germany through East Germany, bound for West Berlin. Lead elements\u2014arranged in a column of 491 vehicles and trailers carrying 1,500 men, divided into five march units\u2014left the Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint at 06:34. At Marienborn, the Soviet checkpoint next to Helmstedt on the West German-East German border, US personnel were counted by guards. The column was 160 kilometres (99\u00a0mi) long, and covered 177 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) from Marienborn to Berlin in full battle gear. East German police watched from beside trees next to the autobahn all the way along.[5]\nThe front of the convoy arrived at the outskirts of Berlin just before noon, to be met by Clay and Johnson, before parading through the streets of Berlin in front of a large crowd. At 04:00 on 21 August, Lyndon Johnson left West Berlin in the hands of General Frederick O. Hartel and his brigade of 4,224 officers and men. \"For the next three and a half years, American battalions would rotate into West Berlin, by autobahn, at three month intervals to demonstrate Allied rights to the city\".[66]\nThe creation of the Wall had important implications for both German states. By stemming the exodus of people from East Germany, the East German government was able to reassert its control over the country: in spite of discontent with the Wall, economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated. The economy in the GDR began to grow. But, the Wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole. Western powers portrayed it as a symbol of communist tyranny, particularly after East German border guards shot and killed would-be defectors. Such fatalities were later treated as acts of murder by the reunified Germany.[67]\nThe Berlin Wall was more than 140 kilometres (87\u00a0mi) long. In June 1962, a second, parallel fence was built some 100 metres (110\u00a0yd) farther into East German territory. The houses contained between the fences were razed and the inhabitants relocated, thus establishing what later became known as the death strip. The death strip was covered with raked sand or gravel, rendering footprints easy to notice, easing the detection of trespassers and also enabling officers to see which guards had neglected their task;[70] it offered no cover; and, most importantly, it offered clear fields of fire for the Wall guards.\nThrough the years, the Berlin Wall evolved through four versions:[71]\nThe \"fourth-generation Wall\", known officially as \"St\u00fctzwandelement UL 12.11\" (retaining wall element UL 12.11), was the final and most sophisticated version of the Wall. Begun in 1975[72] and completed about 1980,[73] it was constructed from 45,000 separate sections of reinforced concrete, each 3.6 metres (12\u00a0ft) high and 1.2 metres (3.9\u00a0ft) wide, and cost DDM16,155,000 or about US$3,638,000.[74] The concrete provisions added to this version of the Wall were done to prevent escapees from driving their cars through the barricades.[75] At strategic points, the Wall was constructed to a somewhat weaker standard, so that East German and Soviet armored vehicles could easily break through in the event of war.[75]\nThe top of the wall was lined with a smooth pipe, intended to make it more difficult to scale. The Wall was reinforced by mesh fencing, signal fencing, anti-vehicle trenches, barbed wire, dogs on long lines, \"beds of nails\" (also known as \"Stalin's Carpet\") under balconies hanging over the \"death strip\", over 116 watchtowers,[76] and 20 bunkers with hundreds of guards. This version of the Wall is the one most commonly seen in photographs, and surviving fragments of the Wall in Berlin and elsewhere around the world are generally pieces of the fourth-generation Wall. The layout came to resemble the inner German border in most technical aspects, except that the Berlin Wall had no landmines nor spring-guns.[70] Maintenance was performed on the outside of the wall by personnel who accessed the area outside it either via ladders or via hidden doors within the wall.[77] These doors could not be opened by a single person, needing two separate keys in two separate keyholes to unlock.[78]\nAs was the case with the inner German border, an unfortified strip of Eastern territory was left outside the wall.[79] This outer strip was used by workers to paint over graffiti and perform other maintenance on the outside of the wall [80] Unlike the inner German border, however, the outer strip was usually no more than four meters wide, and, in photos from the era, the exact location of the actual border in many places appears not even to have been marked. Also in contrast with the inner German border, little interest was shown by East German law enforcement in keeping outsiders off the outer strip; sidewalks of West Berlin streets even ran inside it.[81]\nDespite the East German government's general policy of benign neglect, vandals were not unknown to have been pursued in the outer strip, and even arrested. In 1986, defector and political activist Wolfram Hasch and four other defectors were standing inside the outer strip defacing the wall when East German personnel emerged from one of the hidden doors to apprehend them. All but Hasch escaped back into the western sector. Hasch himself was arrested, dragged through the door into the death strip, and later convicted of illegally crossing the de jure border outside the wall.[82] Noted graffiti artist Thierry Noir has reported having often been perused there by East German soldiers.[83] While some graffiti artists were chased off the outer strip, others, such as Keith Haring, were seemingly tolerated.[84]\nBesides the sector-sector boundary within Berlin itself, the Wall also separated West Berlin from the present-day state of Brandenburg. The following present-day municipalities, listed in counter-clockwise direction, share a border with former West Berlin:\nThere were nine border crossings between East and West Berlin. These allowed visits by West Berliners, other West Germans, Western foreigners and Allied personnel into East Berlin, as well as visits by GDR citizens and citizens of other socialist countries into West Berlin, provided that they held the necessary permits. These crossings were restricted according to which nationality was allowed to use it (East Germans, West Germans, West Berliners, other countries). The most famous was the vehicle and pedestrian checkpoint at the corner of Friedrichstra\u00dfe and Zimmerstra\u00dfe, also known as Checkpoint Charlie, which was restricted to Allied personnel and foreigners.[85]\nSeveral other border crossings existed between West Berlin and surrounding East Germany. These could be used for transit between West Germany and West Berlin, for visits by West Berliners into East Germany, for transit into countries neighbouring East Germany (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Denmark), and for visits by East Germans into West Berlin carrying a permit. After the 1972 agreements, new crossings were opened to allow West Berlin waste to be transported into East German dumps, as well as some crossings for access to West Berlin's exclaves (see Steinst\u00fccken).\nFour autobahns connected West Berlin to West Germany, the most famous being the Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn, which entered East German territory between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn (Checkpoint Alpha), and which entered West Berlin at Dreilinden (Checkpoint Bravo for the Allied forces) in southwestern Berlin. Access to West Berlin was also possible by railway (four routes) and by boat for commercial shipping via canals and rivers.[71][5][86]\nNon-German Westerners could cross the border at Friedrichstra\u00dfe station in East Berlin and at Checkpoint Charlie. When the Wall was erected, Berlin's complex public transit networks, the S-Bahn and U-Bahn, were divided with it.[73] Some lines were cut in half; many stations were shut down. Three western lines traveled through brief sections of East Berlin territory, passing through eastern stations (called Geisterbahnh\u00f6fe, or ghost stations) without stopping. Both the eastern and western networks converged at Friedrichstra\u00dfe, which became a major crossing point for those (mostly Westerners) with permission to cross.[86][87]\nWest Germans and citizens of other Western countries could generally visit East Germany, often after applying for a visa[88] at an East German embassy several weeks in advance. Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this.[87]\nWest Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year (Passierscheinregelung). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.[87]\nIn 1971, with the Four Power Agreement on Berlin, agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.[87]\nEast Berliners and East Germans could not, at first, travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the Wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:\nFor each of these exceptions, GDR citizens had to apply for individual approval, which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of East German Marks into Deutsche Marks (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsgeld, or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.[87]\nCitizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.[87]\nAllied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war Four Powers Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin.[87]\nThe Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the Military Liaison Missions accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in Potsdam.[87]\nAllied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:\nTransit between West Germany and West Berlin\nEntry into and exit from East Berlin\nAs with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR. This was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when crossing between East and West Berlin, which could jeopardize the overall Allied position governing the freedom of movement by Allied forces personnel within all Berlin.\nOrdinary citizens of the Western Allied powers, not formally affiliated with the Allied forces, were authorized to use all designated transit routes through East Germany to and from West Berlin. Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstra\u00c3\u0178e train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to Checkpoint Charlie. In these instances, such travelers, unlike Allied personnel, had to submit to East German border controls.[87]\nDuring the years of the Wall, around 5,000 people successfully defected to West Berlin. The number of people who died trying to cross the Wall, or as a result of the Wall's existence, has been disputed. The most vocal claims by Alexandra Hildebrandt, Director of the Checkpoint Charlie Museum and widow of the Museum's founder, estimated the death toll to be well above 200.[8][9] A historic research group at the Center for Contemporary Historical Research (ZZF) in Potsdam has confirmed at least 140 deaths.[9] Prior official figures listed 98 as being killed.\nThe East German government issued shooting orders (Schie\u00dfbefehl) to border guards dealing with defectors, though such orders are not the same as \"shoot to kill\" orders. GDR officials denied issuing the latter. In an October 1973 order later discovered by researchers, guards were instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals and needed to be shot: \"Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used\".[90]\nEarly successful escapes involved people jumping the initial barbed wire or leaping out of apartment windows along the line, but these ended as the Wall was fortified. East German authorities no longer permitted apartments near the Wall to be occupied, and any building near the Wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up. On 15 August 1961, Conrad Schumann was the first East German border guard to escape by jumping the barbed wire to West Berlin.[91]\nOn 22 August 1961, Ida Siekmann was the first casualty at the Berlin Wall: she died after she jumped out of her third floor apartment at 48 Bernauer Strasse.[92] The first person to be shot and killed while trying to cross to West Berlin was G\u00c3\u00bcnter Litfin, a twenty-four-year-old tailor. He attempted to swim across the Spree Canal to West Germany on 24 August 1961, the same day that East German police had received shoot-to-kill orders to prevent anyone from escaping.[93]\nAnother dramatic escape was carried out on April 1963 by Wolfgang Engels, a 19-year-old civilian employee of the Nationale Volksarmee. Engels stole a Soviet armored personnel carrier from a base where he was deployed and drove it right into the Wall. He was fired at and seriously wounded by border guards. But a West German policeman intervened, firing his weapon at the East German border guards. The policeman removed Engels from the vehicle, which had become entangled in the barbed wire.[94]\nEast Germans successfully defected by a variety of methods: digging long tunnels under the Wall, waiting for favorable winds and taking a hot air balloon, sliding along aerial wires, flying ultralights and, in one instance, simply driving a sports car at full speed through the basic, initial fortifications. When a metal beam was placed at checkpoints to prevent this kind of defection, up to four people (two in the front seats and possibly two in the boot) drove under the bar in a sports car that had been modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with the beam. They lay flat and kept driving forward. The East Germans then built zig-zagging roads at checkpoints. The sewer system predated the Wall, and some people escaped through the sewers,[95] in a number of cases with assistance from the Unternehmen Reiseb\u00fcro.[96]\nAn airborne escape was made by Thomas Kr\u00fcger, who landed a Zlin Z 42M light aircraft of the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Sport und Technik, an East German youth military training organization, at RAF Gatow. His aircraft, registration DDR-WOH, was dismantled and returned to the East Germans by road, complete with humorous slogans painted on it by RAF airmen, such as \"Wish you were here\" and \"Come back soon\". DDR-WOH is still flying today, but under the registration D-EWOH.[citation needed]\nIf an escapee was wounded in a crossing attempt and lay on the death strip, no matter how close they were to the Western wall, Westerners could not intervene for fear of triggering engaging fire from the 'Grepos', the East Berlin border guards. The guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground, as in the most notorious failed attempt, that of Peter Fechter (aged 18). He was shot and bled to death, in full view of the Western media, on 17 August 1962. Fechter's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places, and provide medical care for possible \"would-be escapers\".[97] The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989, while the final person to die in an escape attempt was Winfried Freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas-filled balloon crashed on 8 March 1989.\nThe Wall gave rise to a widespread sense of desperation and oppression in East Berlin, as expressed in the private thoughts of one resident, who confided to her diary \"Our lives have lost their spirit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we can do nothing to stop them.\"[98]\nEvery stone bears witness to the moral bankruptcy of the society it encloses\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Margaret Thatcher commenting about the wall, West Berlin, 1982[99]\nOn 6 June 1987, David Bowie, who earlier for several years lived and recorded in West Berlin, played a concert close to the Wall. This was attended by thousands of Eastern concertgoers across the Wall,[100] followed by violent rioting in East Berlin. According to Tobias Ruther, these protests in East Berlin were the first in the sequence of riots that led to those of November 1989.[101][102] Although other factors were probably more influential in the fall of the Wall,[100] on his death, the German Foreign Office tweeted \"Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.\"[103]\nOn 19 July 1988, 16 months before the Wall came down, Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band, played Rocking the Wall, a live concert in East Berlin, which was attended by 300,000 in person and broadcast delayed on television. Springsteen spoke to the crowd in German, saying: \"I'm not here for or against any government. I've come to play rock 'n' roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down\".[104] East Germany and its FDJ youth organization were worried they were losing an entire generation. They hoped that by letting Springsteen in, they could improve their sentiment among East Germans. However, this strategy of \"one step backwards, two steps forwards\" backfired and the concert only made East Germans hungrier for more of the freedoms that Springsteen epitomized. While John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan delivered their famous speeches from the safety of West Berlin, Springsteen's speaking out against the Wall in the middle of East Berlin added to the euphoria.[104]\nOn 31 December 1989, American TV actor and pop music singer David Hasselhoff was the headlining performer for the Freedom Tour Live concert, which was attended by over 500,000 people on both sides of the Wall. The live concert footage was directed by music video director Thomas Mignone and aired on broadcast television station Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen ZDF throughout Europe. During shooting film crew personnel pulled people up from both sides to stand and celebrate on top of the wall. Hasselhoff sang his Number One hit song \"Looking For Freedom\" on a platform at the end of a twenty-meter steel crane that swung above and over the Wall adjacent to the Brandenburg Gate.[105]\nOn 26 June 1963, 22 months after the erection of the Berlin Wall, U.S. President John F. Kennedy visited West Berlin. Speaking from a platform erected on the steps of Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg for an audience of 450,000 he declared in his Ich bin ein Berliner speech the support of the United States for West Germany and the people of West Berlin in particular:\nTwo thousand years ago, the proudest boast was civis romanus sum [\"I am a Roman citizen\"]. Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"... All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"\nThe message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. The speech is considered one of Kennedy's best, both a notable moment of the Cold War and a high point of the New Frontier. It was a great morale boost for West Berliners, who lived in an exclave deep inside East Germany and feared a possible East German occupation.\nIn a speech at the Brandenburg Gate commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin[106] on 12 June 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan challenged Mikhail Gorbachev, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to tear down the Wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the Eastern Bloc:\nWe welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace. There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall![107]\nIn June 1989 the Hungarian government began dismantling the electrified fence along its border with Austria (with Western TV crews present), and then, in September, more than 13,000 East German tourists escaped through Hungary to Austria.[108] This set up a chain of events. The Hungarians prevented many more East Germans from crossing the border and returned them to Budapest. These East Germans flooded the West German embassy and refused to return to East Germany.[109]\nThe East German government responded by disallowing any further travel to Hungary, but allowed those already there to return to East Germany.[10] This triggered similar events in neighboring Czechoslovakia. This time, however, the East German authorities allowed people to leave, provided that they did so by train through East Germany. This was followed by mass demonstrations within East Germany itself. Protest demonstrations spread throughout East Germany in September 1989. Initially, protesters were mostly people wanting to leave to the West, chanting \"Wir wollen raus!\" (\"We want out!\"). Then protestors began to chant \"Wir bleiben hier!\" (\"We are staying here!\"). This was the start of what East Germans generally call the \"Peaceful Revolution\" of late 1989.[110] The protest demonstrations grew considerably by early November. The movement neared its height on 4 November, when half a million people gathered to demand political change, at the Alexanderplatz demonstration, East Berlin's large public square and transportation hub.[111]\nThe longtime leader of East Germany, Erich Honecker, resigned on 18 October 1989 and was replaced by Egon Krenz that day. Honecker had predicted in January of that year that the Wall would stand for 50 or 100 more years[109] if the conditions that had caused its construction did not change.\nThe wave of refugees leaving East Germany for the West kept increasing. By early November refugees were finding their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia, or via the West German Embassy in Prague. This was tolerated by the new Krenz government, because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. To ease the difficulties, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin. Later the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private, round-trip, travel. The new regulations were to take effect the next day.[112]\nG\u00fcnter Schabowski, the party boss in East Berlin and the spokesman for the SED Politburo, had the task of announcing the new regulations. However, he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated.[113] Shortly before a press conference on 9 November, he was handed a note announcing the changes, but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. These regulations had only been completed a few hours earlier and were to take effect the following day, so as to allow time to inform the border guards. But this starting time delay was not communicated to Schabowski.[50]\nAt the end of the press conference, Schabowski read out loud the note he had been given. One of the reporters, ANSA's Riccardo Ehrman,[114] asked when the regulations would take effect. After a few seconds' hesitation, Schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note and replied, \"As far as I know, it takes effect immediately, without delay\".[50] After further questions from journalists, he confirmed that the regulations included the border crossings through the Wall into West Berlin, which he had not mentioned until then.[115]\nExcerpts from Schabowski's press conference were the lead story on West Germany's two main news programs that night\u2014at 7:17\u00a0p.m. on ZDF's heute and at 8 p.m. on ARD's Tagesschau. This meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of East Germany as well. Later that night, on ARD's Tagesthemen, anchorman Hanns Joachim Friedrichs proclaimed, \"This 9 November is a historic day. The GDR has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone. The gates in the Wall stand open wide.\"[50][113]\nAfter hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the Wall, at the six checkpoints between East and West Berlin, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates.[113] The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the \"more aggressive\" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u201din effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through \"as Schabowski said we can\".[50]\nIt soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Finally, at 10:45\u00a0p.m., Harald J\u00e4ger, the commander of the Bornholmer Stra\u00dfe border crossing yielded, allowing for the guards to open the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking.[116] As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the Wall, and were soon joined by East German youngsters. They danced together to celebrate their new freedom.[117]\nWalking through Checkpoint Charlie, 10 November 1989\nGermans stand on top of the Wall in the days before it was torn down\nAt the Brandenburg Gate, 10 November 1989\nJuggling on the Wall on 16 November 1989\n\"Mauerspecht\" (November 1989)\nThe Fall of the Wall (November 1989)\nAnother border crossing to the south may have been opened earlier. An account by Heinz Sch\u00e4fer indicates that he also acted independently and ordered the opening of the gate at Waltersdorf-Rudow a couple of hours earlier.[118] This may explain reports of East Berliners appearing in West Berlin earlier than the opening of the Bornholmer Stra\u00dfe border crossing.[citation needed]\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall (German: Mauerfall) began the evening of 9 November 1989 and continued over the following days and weeks, with people nicknamed Mauerspechte (wall woodpeckers) using various tools to chip off souvenirs, demolishing lengthy parts in the process, and creating several unofficial border crossings.[119]\nTelevision coverage of citizens demolishing sections of the Wall on 9 November was soon followed by the East German regime announcing ten new border crossings, including the historically significant locations of Potsdamer Platz, Glienicker Br\u00fccke, and Bernauer Stra\u00dfe. Crowds gathered on both sides of the historic crossings waiting for hours to cheer the bulldozers that tore down portions of the Wall to reconnect the divided roads. While the Wall officially remained guarded at a decreasing intensity, new border crossings continued for some time, including the Brandenburg Gate on 22 December 1989. Initially the East German military attempted repairing damage done by the \"Wall peckers\"; gradually these attempts ceased, and guards became more lax, tolerating the increasing demolitions and \"unauthorized\" border crossing through the holes.[120]\nWest Germans and West Berliners were allowed visa-free travel starting 23 December.[120] Until then, they could only visit East Germany and East Berlin under restrictive conditions that involved application for a visa several days or weeks in advance and obligatory exchange of at least 25 DM per day of their planned stay, all of which hindered spontaneous visits. Thus, in the weeks between 9 November and 23 December, East Germans could actually travel more freely than Westerners.[120]\nOn 13 June 1990, the East German military officially began dismantling the Wall, beginning in Bernauer Stra\u00dfe and around the Mitte district. From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Helligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until that December 1990. According to estimates by the border troops, a total of around 1.7 million tonnes of building rubble wasfall. Unofficially, the demolition of the Bornholmer Stra\u00dfe began because of construction work on the railway. This involved a total of 300 GDR border guards and - after 3 October 1990 - 600 Pioneers of the Bundeswehr. These were equipped with 175 trucks, 65 cranes, 55 excavators and 13 bulldozers. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall (that links from West Berlin to East Berlin) was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. In Berlin alone, 184\u00a0km of wall, 154\u00a0km border fence, 144\u00a0km signal systems and 87\u00a0km barrier ditches were removed. What remained were six sections that were to be preserved as a memorial. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenberg border wall, completing the job in November 1991. Painted wall segments with artistically valuable motifs were auctioned in auctions in 1990 in Berlin and Monte Carlo.[120]\nOn 1 July, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all de jure border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that.[121]\nThe fall of the Wall marked the first critical step towards German reunification, which formally concluded a mere 339 days later on 3 October 1990 with the dissolution of East Germany and the official reunification of the German state along the democratic lines of the West German Basic Law.[119]\nAn East German guard talks to a Westerner through a broken seam in the wall in late November 1989.\nA crane removes a section of the Wall near Brandenburg Gate on 21 December 1989.\nAlmost all of the remaining sections were rapidly chipped away.

In September 1989, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pleaded with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev not to let the Berlin Wall fall and confided that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it.[122][123]\n\"We do not want a united Germany. This would lead to a change to postwar borders and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security,\" Thatcher told Gorbachev.[122]\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand warned Thatcher that a unified Germany could make more ground than Adolf Hitler ever had and that Europe would have to bear the consequences.[124]\nOn 21 November 1989, Crosby, Stills & Nash performed the song \"Chippin' Away\" from Graham Nash's 1986 solo album Innocent Eyes in front of the Brandenburg Gate.[125]\nOn 25 December 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin celebrating the end of the Wall, including Beethoven's 9th symphony (Ode to Joy) with the word \"Joy\" (Freude) changed to \"Freedom\" (Freiheit) in the lyrics sung. The poet Schiller may have originally written \"Freedom\" and changed it to \"Joy\" out of fear. The orchestra and choir were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States.[126] On New Year's Eve 1989, David Hasselhoff performed his song \"Looking for Freedom\" while standing atop the partly demolished wall.[127]\nRoger Waters performed the Pink Floyd album The Wall just north of Potsdamer Platz on 21 July 1990, with guests including Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Bryan Adams, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper, Thomas Dolby, Joni Mitchell, Marianne Faithfull, Levon Helm, Rick Danko and Van Morrison.\nOver the years, there has been a repeated controversial debate[128] as to whether 9 November would make a suitable German national holiday, often initiated by former members of political opposition in East Germany, such as Werner Schulz.[129] Besides being the emotional apogee of East Germany's peaceful revolution, 9 November is also the date of the 1918 abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II and declaration of the Weimar Republic, the first German republic. However, 9 November is also the anniversary of the execution of Robert Blum in following the 1848 Vienna revolts, the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch and the infamous Kristallnacht pogroms of the Nazis in 1938. Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel criticized the first euphoria, noting that \"they forgot that 9 November has already entered into history\u00e2\u20ac\u201d51 years earlier it marked the Kristallnacht.\"[130] As reunification was not official and complete until 3 October, that day was finally chosen as German Unity Day.\nOn 9 November 2009, Berlin celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall with a \"Festival of Freedom\" with dignitaries from around the world in attendance for an evening celebration around the Brandenburg Gate. A high point was when over 1,000 colourfully designed foam domino tiles, each over 8 feet (2.4\u00c2\u00a0m) tall, that were stacked along the former route of the Wall in the city center were toppled in stages, converging in front of the Brandenburg Gate.[110]\nA Berlin Twitter Wall was set up to allow Twitter users to post messages commemorating the 20th anniversary. The Chinese government quickly shut down access to the Twitter Wall after masses of Chinese users began using it to protest the Great Firewall of China.[131][132][133]\nIn the United States, the German Embassy coordinated a public diplomacy campaign with the motto \"Freedom Without Walls\", to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The campaign was focused on promoting awareness of the fall of the Berlin Wall among current college students. Students at over 30 universities participated in \"Freedom Without Walls\" events in late 2009. First place winner of the Freedom Without Walls Speaking Contest[134] Robert Cannon received a free trip to Berlin for 2010.[135]\nAn international project called Mauerreise (Journey of the Wall) took place in various countries. Twenty symbolic Wall bricks were sent from Berlin starting in May 2009, with the destinations being Korea, Cyprus, Yemen, and other places where everyday life is characterised by division and border experience. In these places, the bricks will become a blank canvas for artists, intellectuals and young people to tackle the \"wall\" phenomenon.[136]\nTo commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Twinity reconstructed a true-to-scale section of the Wall in virtual Berlin.[137] The MTV Europe Music Awards, on 5 November, had U2 and Tokio Hotel perform songs dedicated to, and about the Berlin Wall. U2 performed at the Brandenburg Gate, and Tokio Hotel performed \"World Behind My Wall\".\nPalestinians in the town of Kalandia, West Bank pulled down parts of the Israeli West Bank barrier, in a demonstration marking the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall.[138]\nThe International Spy Museum in Washington DC hosted a Trabant car rally where 20 Trabants gathered in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Rides were raffled every half-hour and a Trabant crashed through a Berlin Wall mock up. The Trabant was the East German people's car that many used to leave DDR after the collapse.[citation needed]\nThe Allied Museum in the Dahlem district of Berlin hosted a number of events to mark the Twentieth Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. The museum held a Special Exhibition entitled \"Wall Patrol \u2013 The Western Powers and the Berlin Wall 1961\u20131990\" which focused on the daily patrols deployed by the Western powers to observe the situation along the Berlin Wall and the fortifications on the GDR border.[139] A sheet of \"Americans in Berlin\" Commemorative Cinderella stamps designed by T.H.E. Hill, the author of Voices Under Berlin, was presented to the Museum by David Guerra, Berlin veteran and webmaster of the site www.berlinbrigade.com. The stamps splendidly illustrate that even twenty years on, veterans of service in Berlin still regard their service there as one of the high points of their lives.[140]\nRemaining stretch of the Wall near Ostbahnhof in Friedrichshain called East Side Gallery, August 2006\nRemains of the Wall adjacent to the Topography of Terror, August 2007\nA memorial of over a thousand crosses and a segment of the Wall for those who died trying to cross.

Three long sections are still standing: an 80-metre-long (260\u00a0ft) piece of the first (westernmost) wall at the Topography of Terror, site of the former Gestapo headquarters, halfway between Checkpoint Charlie and Potsdamer Platz; a longer section of the second (easternmost) wall along the Spree River near the Oberbaumbr\u00fccke, nicknamed East Side Gallery; and a third section that is partly reconstructed, in the north at Bernauer Stra\u00dfe, which was turned into a memorial in 1999. Other isolated fragments, lampposts, other elements, and a few watchtowers also remain in various parts of the city.\nNothing still accurately represents the Wall's original appearance better than a very short stretch at Bernauer Stra\u00c3\u0178e associated with the Berlin Wall Documentation Center.[142] Other remnants are badly damaged by souvenir seekers. Fragments of the Wall were taken and some were sold around the world. Appearing both with and without certificates of authenticity, these fragments are now a staple on the online auction service eBay as well as German souvenir shops. Today, the eastern side is covered in graffiti that did not exist while the Wall was guarded by the armed soldiers of East Germany. Previously, graffiti appeared only on the western side. Along some tourist areas of the city centre, the city government has marked the location of the former Wall by a row of cobblestones in the street. In most places only the \"first\" wall is marked, except near Potsdamer Platz where the stretch of both walls is marked, giving visitors an impression of the dimension of the barrier system.[citation needed]\nAfter the fall of Berlin Wall, there were initiatives that they want to preserve the death strip walkways and redevelop it into a hiking and cycling area, known as Berliner Mauerweg. It is part of the initiative by Berlin Senate since 2005.\nFor many years after reunification, people in Germany talked about cultural differences between East and West Germans (colloquially Ossis and Wessis), sometimes described as Mauer im Kopf (The wall in the head). A September 2004 poll found that 25 percent of West Germans and 12 percent of East Germans wished that East and West should be separated again by a \"Wall\".[143] A poll taken in October 2009 on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall indicated, however, that only about a tenth of the population was still unhappy with the unification (8 percent in the East; 12 percent in the West). Although differences are still perceived between East and West, Germans make similar distinctions between North and South.[144]\nA 2011 poll conducted by Russia's VTsIOM, found that more than half of all Russians do not know who built the Berlin Wall. Ten percent of people surveyed thought Berlin residents built it themselves. Six percent said Western powers built it and four percent thought it was a \"bilateral initiative\" of the Soviet Union and the West. Fifty-eight percent said they did not know who built it, with just 24 percent correctly naming the Soviet Union and its then-communist ally East Germany.[145]\nNot all segments of the Wall were ground up as the Wall was being torn down. Many segments have been given to various institutions in the world. They can be found, for instance, in presidential and historical museums, lobbies of hotels and corporations, at universities and government buildings, and in public spaces in different countries of the world.[146]\nOn 13 August 2011, Germany marked the 50th anniversary of East Germany beginning the erection of the Berlin Wall. Chancellor Angela Merkel joined with President Christian Wulff and Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit at the Bernauer Stra\u00c3\u0178e memorial park to remember lives and liberty. Speeches extolled freedom and a minute of silence at noon honored those who died trying to flee to the West. \"It is our shared responsibility to keep the memory alive and to pass it on to the coming generations as a reminder to stand up for freedom and democracy to ensure that such injustice may never happen again,\" entreated Mayor Wowereit. \"It has been shown once again: Freedom is invincible at the end. No wall can permanently withstand the desire for freedom\", proclaimed President Wulff.\"[147][148][149][150]",

        "text": "Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 biographical war drama film directed by Mel Gibson and written by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. The film focuses on the World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, refusing to carry or use a firearm or weapons of any kind. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty during the Battle of Okinawa. Andrew Garfield stars as Doss, with Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, and Vince Vaughn in supporting roles.\nThe film was released in the United States on November 4, 2016, grossing $175.3 million worldwide and received largely positive reviews, with Gibson's direction and Garfield's performance earning notable praise.[5] Hacksaw Ridge was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of its top ten Movies of the Year,[6] and has received numerous awards and nominations. The film received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Garfield and Best Sound Editing, winning the awards for Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing.[7][8] It also received Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor,[9] and 12 AACTA Awards nominations, winning the majority, including Best Film, Best Direction, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor for Garfield, and Best Supporting Actor for Weaving.\nAs a child, Desmond Doss nearly kills his younger brother Hal. This experience and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\". Years later, Doss takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. The two begin a relationship and Doss tells Dorothy of his interest in medical work.\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Doss enlists in the Army and intends to serve as a combat medic. His father Tom, a troubled World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Before leaving for Fort Jackson, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage and she accepts.\nDoss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but are overruled, as Doss' religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers and continues training.\nDoss' unit completes basic training and is released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his trial, Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.\nDoss' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division, which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"\nThe next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, while Howell and several of Doss' squad mates are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying wounded soldiers to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded once presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell and the two finally escape Hacksaw under enemy fire.\nCaptain Glover tells Doss that the men have been inspired by his selflessness, and that they will not launch the next attack without him. Despite the next day being the Sabbath day, he joins his fellow soldiers after finishing his prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. During an ambush set by Japanese soldiers feigning surrender, Doss manages to save Glover and others by knocking away enemy grenades. Doss is eventually wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss descends the cliff, clutching the Bible Dorothy gave him.\nThe film switches to archival photos and footage showing that Doss was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge. Doss stayed married to Dorothy until her death in 1991. He died on March 23, 2006, at the age of 87.\nHacksaw Ridge was in development limbo for fourteen years.[10] Numerous producers had tried for decades to film Doss' story, including decorated war hero Audie Murphy and Hal B. Wallis.[11]\nIn 2001, after finally convincing Doss that making a movie on his remarkable life was the right thing to do, screenwriter/producer Gregory Crosby (grandson of Bing Crosby) wrote the treatment and brought the project to film producer David Permut, of Permut Presentations, through the early efforts of Stan Jensen of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which ultimately led to the film being financed.[10]\nIn 2004, director Terry Benedict won the rights to make a documentary about Doss, The Conscientious Objector, and secured the dramatic film rights in the process. However, Doss died in 2006, after which producer Bill Mechanic acquired and then sold the rights to Walden Media, which developed the project along with producer David Permut.[12] Co-producers of the film are Gregory Crosby and Steve Longi.[13] Walden Media insisted on a PG-13 version of the battle, and Mechanic spent years working to buy the rights back.[11][14]\nAfter acquiring the rights, Mechanic approached Mel Gibson, and wanted him to create a concoction of violence and faith, as he did with The Passion of the Christ (2004). Gibson turned down the offer twice, as he previously did with Braveheart (1995).[15] Nearly a decade later, Gibson finally agreed to direct, a decision announced in November 2014. The same month, Andrew Garfield was confirmed to play the role of Desmond Doss.[12]\nWith a budget of $40 million, the team still faced many challenges. Hacksaw Ridge became an international co-production, with key players and firms located in both the United States and Australia. When Australian tax incentives were taken off the table, the film had to qualify as Australian to receive government subsidies. Despite being American-born, Gibson's early years in Australia helped the film qualify, along with most of the cast being Australian, including Rachel Griffiths (Doss' mother), Teresa Palmer (Doss' wife), Sam Worthington (unit leader), Hugo Weaving (as Doss' father), Richard Roxburgh (as a colonel) and Luke Bracey (as Smitty, one of Doss' most antagonistic unit members). Rounding out the cast was American actor Vince Vaughn.[16]\nOn February 9, 2015, IM Global closed a deal to finance the film, and also sold the film into the international markets.[17] On the same day, Lionsgate acquired the North American distribution rights to the film.[18] Chinese distribution rights were acquired by Bliss Media, a Shanghai-based film production and distribution company.[19]\nHacksaw Ridge is the first film directed by Gibson since Apocalypto in 2006,[20][21] and marks a departure from his previous films, such as Apocalypto and Braveheart, in which the protagonists acted violently.[22]\nRobert Schenkkan and Randall Wallace wrote the script, and Wallace was previously attached to direct the film. Andrew Knight polished the original script. Gibson's partner Bruce Davey also produced the film, along with Paul Currie.[23]\nThe cast \u2013 Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Rachel Griffiths, Richard Roxburgh, Luke Pegler, Richard Pyros, Ben Mingay, Firass Dirani, Nico Cortez, Michael Sheasby, Goran Kleut, Jacob Warner, Harry Greenwood, Damien Thomlinson, Ben O\u2019Toole, Benedict Hardie, Robert Morgan, Ori Pfeffer, Milo Gibson, and Nathaniel Buzolic, Hugo Weaving, and Ryan Corr \u2013 was announced between November 2014 and October 2015.[23][24][25][26][27] The younger Doss was played by Darcy Bryce.[28]\nGarfield plays Desmond Doss, a US Army medic awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for saving lives during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II.[12] Garfield had high regards for Doss, and venerated him for his act of bravery, hailing him as a \"wonderful symbol of embodying the idea of live and let live no matter what your ideology is, no matter what your value system is, just to allow other people to be who they are and allow yourself to be who you are.\" He found the idea of playing a real superhero, as compared to his past roles playing Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel, much more inspiring.[29] Garfield admitted that he cried the first time he read the screenplay.[30] He visited Doss' hometown and touched his various tools.[31] Gibson was drawn to Garfield the first time he saw his performance in The Social Network.[22]\nPalmer wanted a role in the film so badly that she auditioned via phone, and sent the recording to Gibson. She heard nothing back for three months, until Gibson called Palmer to tell her in a Skype chat that he had cast her in the role of Dorothy, Doss' wife.[32]\nPrincipal photography started on September 29, 2015,[21] and lasted for 59 days,[33] ending in December of that year.[10] Filming took place entirely in Australia.[15] The film was based at Fox Studios in Sydney, after producers vigorously scouted for locations around the country.[34] Filming took place mostly in the state of New South Wales\u00a0\u2014 where Gibson spent much of his early years\u00a0\u2014 in and around Sydney such as in Richmond,[35] Bringelly,[36] and Oran Park.[37] Gibson moved to the state in July 2015, two months before filming began.[38] The graveyard scene was shot at a set-constructed cemetery in Sydney's Centennial Park.[39] The grounds of Newington Armory at Sydney Olympic Park were used as Fort Jackson. Filming in Bringelly required the team to clear and deforest over 500 hectares of land, which evoked the ire of some environmentalists. However, the producers had complete approval and clearance to do so. Also conditions were imposed to replant and rehabilitate part of the land after filming ceased.[40] According to Troy Grant, New South Wales' deputy premier and minister for the arts, the film brought 720 jobs and US$19 million to regional and rural New South Wales.[41]\nAltogether, three jeeps, two trucks and a tank were featured in the film.[15] Bulldozers and backhoes were used to transform a dairy pasture near Sydney to re-create the Okinawa battlefield. A berm had to be raised around the perimeter so cameras could turn 360 degrees without getting any eucalyptus trees in the background.[15] Gibson did not want to rely heavily on computer visual effects, either on the screen or in pre-visualizing the battle scenes. Visual effects were used only during bloody scenes, like napalm-burnt soldiers.[15] During filming of the war scenes, Gibson incorporated his past war-movie experiences, and would yell to the actors, reminding them constantly of what they were fighting for.[15]\nKevin O'Connell, who won his first Academy Award for sound mixing in this film, stated that budget constraints forced him to utilize archival sounds of WWII-era weapons.[42]\nThe film has been described as an anti-war film,[43] with pacifist themes.[15] It also incorporates recurring religious imagery, such as baptism and ascension.[3]\nAfter the war, Doss turned down many requests for books and film versions of his actions, because he was wary of whether his life, wartime experiences, and Seventh-day Adventist beliefs would be portrayed inaccurately or sensationally. Doss' only child, Desmond Doss Jr., stated: \"The reason he declined is that none of them adhered to his one requirement: that it be accurate. And I find it remarkable, the level of accuracy in adhering to the principal of the story in this movie.\"[44] Producer David Permut stated that the filmmakers took great care in maintaining the integrity of the story, since Doss was very religious.[3]\nHowever, the filmmakers did change some details, notably the backstory about his father, the incident with the gun Doss took out of his alcoholic father's hands, and the circumstances of his first marriage.[44][45] The character of Smitty, portrayed by Luke Bracey, is an amalgamation of various soldiers who tormented Doss and was created for narrative reasons.[46] Other changes to the story occur near the end of the movie when Doss is placed on a stretcher. In real life, Doss had another wounded man take his place on the stretcher. After treating the soldier, a sniper shot fractured Doss' arm and he crawled to safety after being left alone for five hours.[47] Gibson omitted this from the film because he felt that the audience would not find the scene believable.[48] The film also omits his prior combat service in the Battle of Guam and Battle of Leyte (Doss was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for extraordinary bravery in both battles),[49] and leaves the impression that Doss' actions at Okinawa took place over a period of a few days, though his Medal of Honor citation covered his actions over a period of about three weeks (April 29 to May 21).[44][50]\nJames Horner was originally approached to compose the score for the film but was replaced by John Debney after Horner's untimely death in 2015.[51] Debney was himself replaced by Rupert Gregson-Williams after his score was rejected before Hacksaw Ridge was set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival.[52] When composing the music Gregson-Williams commented: \"The soundtrack is really in two parts. A lovely romance blossoms as Desmond discovers both the love of his life and his faith. The second half of the movie is brutal...We wanted to reflect his spirituality without being pious, and his bravery without celebrating violence.\"[53] The film's accompanying score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, with an orchestra of 70 musicians and a 36-voice choir conducted by Cliff Masterson.[54]\nAll tracks written by Rupert Gregson-Williams.\nThe world premiere of Hacksaw Ridge occurred on September 4, 2016,[55] at the 73rd Venice Film Festival, where it received a 10-minute standing ovation.[56] The film was released in Australia on November 3, 2016, by Icon Film Distribution, and in the United States on November 4, 2016, by Lionsgate/Summit Entertainment.[57][58] It was released by Bliss Media in China in November,[59][60] and in the United Kingdom in 2017,[61] with IM Global handling international sales.[21]\nIn August 2016, Gibson appeared at Pastor Greg Laurie's SoCal Harvest in Anaheim, California, to promote the film.[62]\nHacksaw Ridge grossed $67.1 million in the United States and Canada and $108.2 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $175.3 million, against a production budget of $40 million.[5]\nThe film opened alongside Doctor Strange and Trolls, and was projected to gross around $12 million from 2,886 theaters. It was expected to play very well among faith-based, Midwest, and Southern audiences.[63][64] It made $5.2 million on its first day and $15.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office behind Doctor Strange and Trolls. The debut was on par with the $15 million opening of Gibson's last directorial effort, Apocalypto, in 2006.[65] In its second weekend, the film grossed $10.8 million (a drop of just 29.1%), finishing 5th at the box office.\nThe film also opened successfully in China, grossing over $16 million in its first four days at the box office.[66]\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 244 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Hacksaw Ridge uses a real-life pacifist's legacy to lay the groundwork for a gripping wartime tribute to faith, valor, and the courage of remaining true to one's convictions.\"[67] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[68] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[69]\nThe Milford Daily News called the film a \"masterpiece\", adding that it \"is going to end up on many 2016 Top 10 lists, that should get Oscar nominations for Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.\"[70] Maggie Stancu of Movie Pilot wrote that \"Gibson made some of his most genius directing choices in Hacksaw Ridge, and Garfield has given his best performance yet. With amazing performances by Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington and Hugo Weaving, it is absolutely one of 2016's must-see films.\"[71] Mick LaSalle of SFGate called the film \"a brilliant return for Mel Gibson, which confirms his position as a director with a singular talent for spectacle and a sure way with actors.\"[72] In The Film Lawyers, Samar Khan called Hacksaw Ridge \"fantastic,\" and emphasised \"just how wonderful it is to have Gibson back in a more prominent position in Hollywood, hopefully with the demons of his past behind him. If Hacksaw Ridge is any indication, we are poised for a future filled with great films from the visionary director.\"[73] The Daily Telegraph awarded four stars, and added: \"Hacksaw Ridge is a fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face \u2013 a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd.\u201d[74]\nThe Guardian also awarded the film four stars, and stated that Gibson had \"absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park.\"[75] The Australian's reviewer was equally positive, stating that, as a director, \"Gibson\u2019s approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera.\"[76] Rex Reed of Observer rated it with four stars, and called it \"the best war film since Saving Private Ryan... [I]t is violent, harrowing, heartbreaking and unforgettable. And yes, it was directed by Mel Gibson. He deserves a medal, too\"[77] Michael Smith of Tulsa World called Hacksaw Ridge a \"moving character study\" and praised both the direction and acting: \"It\u2019s truly remarkable how Gibson can film scenes of such heartfelt emotion with such sweet subtlety as easily as he stages some of the most vicious, visual scenes of violence that you will ever see. ... Hacksaw Ridge is beautiful and brutal, and that\u2019s a potent combination for a movie about a man determined to serve his country, as well as his soul.\"[78] IGN critic Alex Welch gave a score of 8/10, praising it as \"one of the most successful war films of recent memory,\" and \"at times horrifying, inspiring, and heart-wrenching.\"[79] Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, praising Gibson's direction and saying, \"There are two moments during the second half of Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge when I literally jumped out of my seat in terror. The film's depiction of war is the best I\u2019ve seen since Saving Private Ryan.\"[80] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 stars, writing, \"Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.\"[81] In contrast, Matt Zoller Seitz for RogerEbert.com gave the film 2.5 stars, and described the film as \"a movie at war with itself.\"[82]\nHacksaw Ridge won Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Garfield and Best Sound Editing at the Academy Awards.[83] The film won Best Editing and was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Garfield, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Makeup and Hair at the British Academy Film Awards.[84] The film won Best Action Movie and Best Actor in an Action Movie for Garfield and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Garfield, Best Editing and Best Hair and Makeup at the Critics' Choice Awards.[85] The film received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama for Garfield and Best Director.[9] The film won Best Actor for Garfield, Best Film Editing and Best Sound and was nominated for Best Film, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score and Best Art Direction and Production Design at the Satellite Awards.[86]",

        "text": "The Nusaybah Clan (Arabic: \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u0633\u064a\u0628\u0629\u200e; alternatively spelt Nussaiba, Nusseibeh and Nuseibeh) is the oldest Muslim dynasty in Jerusalem.[1] The Nusaybah family has a long history and tight bonds with the Holy Land, Jerusalem, since the days their first forefathers arrived into Jerusalem in the 7th century.\nAccording to tradition, the Nusaybah family took its name from a female companion or Sahabah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad named Nusaybah bint Ka'ab. She was a member of the Ansar who transferred their political power over Medina to the prophet. Nusaybah fought along with Muhammed in battle and was an early example of women taking leadership roles in Islam. Since the arrival of Islam in Jerusalem in the seventh century, the Sunni Muslim family has held the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre alongside the Joudeh Al-Goudia family (who were added to the original arrangement in the time of Saladin, the Muslim conqueror who seized the holy city from the Crusaders in 1187)[2].[3][4][5] This arrangement emerged during the days of the second Sunni caliph Umar Ibn al-Khattab, who hoped to avoid clashes among rival Christian sects for control over the church.[citation needed] Although symbolic, the arrangement has provided the stability the Christians of the city needed, and is a symbol of tolerance and inter-religious harmony,[citation needed] and gave the Nusaybah family a visible role in Christian activities in Jerusalem, which include pilgrimages and visits by Western Christians.\nAncestors of the family arrived in Jerusalem with the arrival of Islam in AD 637. They included two companions of the Islamic Prophet Muhammed \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Abdullah bin Nusaybah and Mu'adh bin Jabal, and many others of the Prophet's companions and maternal uncles, descendents of Salma from Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj, the wife of Hashim, forefather of the Hashemite Family and mother of its renowned leader Abdul Muttalib, grandfather of Muhammed. The Nusaybah family is a clan of the Khazraj tribe of Medina, known in Islam as al-Ansar, for their support and protection of Prophet Muhammed during his exile from Mecca.[6]\nWhen the prayer time came, the Archbishop of Jerusalem, Sophronius, invited Umar, to pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Christianity's holiest site. Umar refused fearing that future Muslim generations would claim the church as their own and turn it into a mosque. Umar instead prayed a few yards away from the church where a mosque is built now. The Mosque of Umar still stands next to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as a reminder of the strong Muslim-Christian bond in the Holy Land. Upon entering Jerusalem, Umar signed with the Christians of Jerusalem what became known as the \"Covenant of Umar\". It guaranteed protection for the Christians to live and worship freely and also protection for the Christian places of worship.\nOne of the great ancestors of the Nusaybah family was Ubada Ibn Al-Samet who settled in Jerusalem in the 7th century in the wake of the Arab-Islamic capture of Jerusalem, and who was appointed as a governor by Umar. It is said that the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre were placed in the custody of the family during this period.\nThe ancient records and manuscripts kept by the various Christian denominations in their monasteries all record the Nusaybah family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship and that of their ancestral forefathers from the Bani Ghanim al-Khazraj to the Holy Sepulchre, at least since the time of Saladin more than 800 years ago, specifically since 1192, when Sultan Saladin and King Richard the Lionheart concluded an agreement allowing western Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy Sepulchre under certain stipulations.

        "text": "\"Ticket to Ride\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Issued as a single in April 1965, it became the Beatles' seventh consecutive number 1 hit in the United Kingdom and their third consecutive number 1 hit in the United States, and similarly topped national charts in Canada, Australia and Ireland. The song was also included on their 1965 studio album Help! Recorded at EMI Studios in London in February that year, the track marked a progression in the Beatles' work through the incorporation of drone and harder-sounding instrumentation relative to their previous releases. Among music critics, Ian MacDonald describes the song as \"psychologically deeper than anything the Beatles had recorded before\" and \"extraordinary for its time\".[4]\n\"Ticket to Ride\" appears in a sequence in the Beatles' second feature film, Help!, directed by Richard Lester. Live performances by the band were included in the Beatles at Shea Stadium concert film, on the live album documenting their concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and on the 1996 Anthology 2 box set. In 1969, \"Ticket to Ride\" was covered by the Carpenters, whose version peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\"Ticket to Ride\" was written by John Lennon,[5][6][7][8] although credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney.[9] In his authorised biography, however, Paul McCartney contradicts this,[10] saying: \"we sat down and wrote it together \u2026 give him 60 percent of it \u2026 we sat down together and worked on that for a full three-hour songwriting session.\"[11] Speaking in 1980, Lennon said that McCartney's contribution was limited to \"the way Ringo [Starr] played the drums\" on the recording.[12]\nThe song is written in the key of A major. The structure of the composition is in an expanded variation of the AABA pop song format, with eight bars of verse and eight bars of chorus forming the A section, and a nine-bar primary bridge forming the B section.[13] The sustained A chord over the verses creates an implied drone common in Indian music[14] and supports a melody that author Ian MacDonald terms \"raga-like\".[15]\nThe song's coda features a change of tempo.[16] In the view of musicologist Walter Everett, the latter section marks a progression on previous Beatles songs that similarly revisit aspects of a composition when ending with a coda. In the case of \"Ticket to Ride\", the section consists of a repeated refrain similar to the last line of the chorus (\"My baby don't care\"), played over a constant A major chord and set to the double-time rhythm used in the bridge.[17] Lennon said this closing section was one of his \"favourite bits\" in the song.[18] He also claimed that \"Ticket to Ride\" was the first heavy metal record ever made.[13] According to MacDonald, the track's heavy sound may have been influenced by Lennon and George Harrison's first encounter with LSD, the precise date for which varies among Beatles biographers.[19]\nWhile the lyrics describe a girl \"riding out of the life of the narrator\",[20] the inspiration of the title phrase is unclear,[6] as is the meaning of the song.[21] McCartney said the title referred to \"a British Railways ticket to the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight\",[11] and Lennon said it described cards indicating a clean bill of health carried by Hamburg prostitutes in the 1960s.[20] The Beatles played in Hamburg early in their musical career, and a \"ride\" was British slang for having sex.[21] Gaby Whitehill and Andrew Trendall of Gigwise have interpreted the song to be about a woman leaving her boyfriend to become a prostitute.[22]\nThe Beatles recorded \"Ticket to Ride\" on 15 February 1965 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London.[24] It was the band's first recording session since completing the Beatles for Sale album on 26 October 1964,[25] after which they had toured the UK and played a season of Christmas shows in London through to mid January.[26] The session inaugurated what author Mark Lewisohn describes as \"a more serious application in the recording studio\" by the group, which included taping rehearsals of each song they worked on and concentrating on backing or rhythm tracks, after which they would overdub more detailed instrumental parts.[5] Everett views the recording as a radical departure for the Beatles, due to the vocals and lead guitar parts being overdubbed for the first time.[27]\nThe song's main guitar riff was played by Harrison on his Rickenbacker 12-string guitar[28] and was among the parts taped with the rhythm track.[29] Author Mark Hertsgaard highlights the idea for this riff and for Starr's \"jagged, whack-and-jump\" drum pattern as examples of McCartney's increasing importance as the Beatles' musical director.[30] According to Harrison, however, the Rickenbacker riff was his own idea, based on the way Lennon strummed the chord when introducing the song to the band. Harrison also said that the \"staggered\" motion of the riff then inspired the pattern that Starr decided to play.[31][32] In addition to Lennon's lead vocal and McCartney's harmony, the overdubs included further electric guitar parts by Lennon and Harrison (on Rickenbacker 325 and Fender Stratocaster, respectively), over the verses, and by McCartney (on Epiphone Casino), who supplied the fills that close the bridges and the solo over the coda.[33]\nIn March 1965, the Beatles and their manager, Brian Epstein, selected \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"Yes It Is\" to be the A- and B-sides, respectively, of the group's first single release of the year.[34] The record was issued by EMI's Parlophone label on 9 April 1965 in the United Kingdom, and by Capitol Records on 19 April in the United States.[35] A contemporary news report stated that the Beatles were due to promote the single on television shows such as Top of the Pops and Thank Your Lucky Stars, and that the band were forming an independent production company with their producer, George Martin, which would earn them a more favourable financial return on their recordings.[36] In addition to their television promotion, the group performed the song during their last session for BBC Radio, on 26 May,[34] which was broadcast as The Beatles (Invite You to Take a Ticket to Ride).[37][38]\n\"Ticket to Ride\" topped Britain's official singles chart for three weeks.[39] It went straight in at number 1 on the national listings compiled by Melody Maker, where it also stayed for three weeks,[40] and similarly topped Ireland's singles chart in its first week of release there.[41] In America, the song was number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week.[39] According to Billboard's Hits of the World listings for 15 May 1965, \"Ticket to Ride\" was also the top-selling single in Australia.[42] The US single's face label stated that the A-side was from the forthcoming United Artists release Eight Arms to Hold You, which was the original title of the Beatles' second film,[43] directed by Richard Lester.[44] The title was changed to Help! after the single's release.[39] In the film, the song plays over a sequence during which the Beatles attempt to ski and frequently fall over.[43] The track also appeared on the band's 1965 album Help!,[45] which was issued on 6 August in the UK and on 13 August in the US.[46]\n\"Ticket to Ride\" was the eighth consecutive chart-topping single for the Beatles in the UK[6][47] and the first Beatles track released with a running time exceeding three minutes.[23] On the American charts, it was the third of six number 1 singles in a row,[6] a record at the time, along with \"I Feel Fine\", \"Eight Days a Week\", \"Help!\", \"Yesterday\" and \"We Can Work It Out\".[48] Everett writes that although the song achieved \"classic\" status, it was a surprise among Beatles singles in that it failed to achieve gold accreditation from the Recording Industry Association of America.[34] When the song hit number 1 there, the Beatles became the fourth consecutive English group to hold down the top spot, after Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, and Herman's Hermits. Thus, the Beatles broke a combined six-week run at the top for Mancunian groups. As part of EMI's policy of celebrating the 20th anniversary of each Beatles single, \"Ticket to Ride\" was reissued in the UK in April 1985[49] and peaked at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart.[50]\nOn 23 November 1965,[51] the Beatles filmed promotional clips for \"Ticket to Ride\" and four other songs, including both sides of their upcoming single at the time, \"Day Tripper\" / \"We Can Work It Out\", at Twickenham Film Studios in south-west London.[52][53] The films were directed by Joe McGrath, who had worked on Help! as an assistant to Lester.[54] In the case of \"Ticket to Ride\", the clip was made for inclusion in Top of the Pops' round-up of the biggest hits of 1965.[55]\nAgainst a backdrop of oversized tickets, the Beatles are shown miming to the song, with Starr standing at his drum kit and the other band members sitting in director's chairs.[56] Part of the clip appeared in the 1995 documentary The Beatles Anthology. In 2015, it was included in full on the Beatles' video compilation 1.[57]\nIn his contemporary review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME admired the \"depth of sound\" and \"tremendous drive\" of the recording.[58] Music critics Richie Unterberger of AllMusic and Ian MacDonald both recognise \"Ticket to Ride\" as an important milestone in the evolution of the musical style of the Beatles. Unterberger said, \"the rhythm parts on 'Ticket to Ride' were harder and heavier than they had been on any previous Beatles outing, particularly in Ringo Starr's stormy stutters and rolls.\"[59] MacDonald describes it as \"psychologically deeper than anything the Beatles had recorded before ... extraordinary for its time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c massive with chiming electric guitars, weighty rhythm, and rumbling floor tom-toms\", and he views the production as a signal of the band's next major change of musical direction, with \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" in April 1966.[60] MacDonald also notes that, while the Kinks' \"See My Friends\" has been identified as the inspiration for the Beatles' incorporation of Indian sounds later in 1965, the implied drone in \"Ticket to Ride\" could equally have influenced the Kinks when they recorded \"See My Friends\".[61]\nWriting for Mojo in 2002, musician and journalist Bob Stanley recognised the track as \"where moptop Beatlemania ends and [the Beatles]' weightless, ageless legend begins\".[62] In his song review for Blender, Johnny Black similarly described it as a \"watershed\" recording and attributed its relatively poor US sales to the song's \"weird soup of hypnotically chiming, droning guitars, stuttering drums and contrasting vocal textures that, in the context of the 1965 charts, was far ahead of its time\".[21] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph identifies a darker edge to Lennon's lyric writing during the Help! period and he cites \"the drone of riffing, proto-heavy-rock song Ticket to Ride\" as an example of the band's more sophisticated sound, and of how the album \"contains some of their greatest early songs\".[63] In his review of Help! for BBC Music, David Quantick includes \"Ticket to Ride\" among the album's \"flashes of brilliance\" and describes it as \"the song that saw The Beatles take on The Kinks, the Stones and The Who at their own, more rocky game\".[64]\n\"Ticket to Ride\" has been included in many critics' best-song lists, including top 500 \"all-time\" lists compiled by Rolling Stone in 2010 (at number 394) and the NME in 2014 (number 311). Dave Marsh ranked it 29th on his 1989 list \"The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made\".[65] The track appeared at number 17 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\"[23] and at number 23 on a similar list compiled by Mojo. In his commentary for Mojo, John Harris said that \"Ticket to Ride\" was \"the sound of a four-piece group hurtling way beyond the beat-pop being churned out by their peers\".[66] In 2014, USA Today named it the best Beatles song, saying: \"No single better reflects the ambition, tension and pure pop genius that made the Beatles unique \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Ticket to Ride is perfection all the way through.\"[67]\nThe Beatles played \"Ticket to Ride\" throughout their June\u2013July 1965 European tour.[68] A live performance from the 1 August 1965 broadcast of Blackpool Night Out was included on the Anthology 2 compilation and shown during The Beatles Anthology documentary.[69] On 14 August, the group recorded a live performance of the song for The Ed Sullivan Show, broadcast the following month.[70]\n\"Ticket to Ride\" was also included in the set list for the Beatles' 1965 US tour[70] and their UK tour at the end of the year.[52] The 15 August performance at Shea Stadium appears in the 1966 documentary The Beatles at Shea Stadium, although the audio for the song was re-recorded in London prior to release.[71] The group's 29 August performance at the Hollywood Bowl was chosen for the 1977 album The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl.[72][73]\nIn the summer of 1969 \"Ticket to Ride\" was covered by the American pop music duo the Carpenters for their debut studio album Offering. Richard Carpenter recalled: \"I happened to hear [the song] being played as an oldie one day in early 1969, and upon hearing it this particular time, decided the tune would make a nice ballad.\"[74] As arranged by Richard Carpenter, the song became the plaint of a castoff lover, with the opening line: \"I think I'm gonna be sad\", being sung repeatedly as the track fades.\nThe line-up on the recording was Karen Carpenter (lead and backing vocals, drums), Richard Carpenter (backing vocals, piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, orchestration), Joe Osborn (bass), David Duke (French horn), Herb Alpert (shaker) and uncredited contributors on bell tree and tubular bells.\nReleased as a single \u2013 without the album track's introductory twelve measures \u2013 \"Ticket to Ride\" became the Carpenters' first charting single, peaking at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1970 and reaching number 19 on the same magazine's Adult Contemporary chart.[75] The single's success led to its parent album being reissued as Ticket to Ride.[76] The first Carpenters' retrospective, The Singles: 1969\u20131973, issued in 1973, featured an amended version of \"Ticket to Ride\" with a new lead vocal by Karen Carpenter. Other amendments were a new drum track by Karen to replace her drumming on the original track, and the addition of guitar work by Carpenters regular sideman Tony Peluso (who had not been attached to the group in 1969).\nThe song was covered by former Motown artist Mary Wells,[8] a favourite of the Beatles, who had invited her to open their concerts during a 1964 UK tour.[77] Wells' recording appeared on her 1965 album Love Songs to the Beatles.[77] Later that year, George Martin included \"Ticket to Ride\" on his album of orchestral instrumentals titled Help!, producing a version that Billboard's reviewer admired as being \"worth the price of the album\".[78]\nMezzo-soprano singer Cathy Berberian opened her 1967 album Beatles Arias with a baroque interpretation of \"Ticket to Ride\" arranged by Luciano Berio.[79] Late the previous year, Berberian had surprised her Carnegie Hall concert audience by performing this and two other well-known Beatles songs \u2013 a gesture that musicologist Kate Meehan cites as reflecting the band's elevated status among many classical musicians and composers from mid 1965 onwards.[80]\nEnglish singer Alma Cogan, with whom Lennon had an extramarital affair,[81][82] covered \"Ticket to Ride\" in the style of Dionne Warwick for her final album, Alma,[83] released a year after her death in 1966.[84] Vanilla Fudge recorded what Paul Collins of AllMusic describes as a \"stoned-out, slowed-down\" version of the track for their 1967 self-titled debut album.[85] The 5th Dimension included \"Ticket to Ride\" on The Magic Garden,[86] an album that, according to Ken Shane of Popdose, \"tells the story of a love affair from its rapturous beginning, through trials and tribulations to its end, and beyond\".[87] While Unterberger dismisses it as \"a misfired cover\",[88] Shane describes the song as \"a terrific version\" that complements the Jimmy Webb-written song cycle that fills the rest of the album.[87]\n\"Ticket to Ride\" was also covered by the Bee Gees,[8] whose version appeared on their limited-release rarities compilation Inception/Nostalgia (1970),[89] and by the New Seekers, who combined it in a medley with \"Georgy Girl\" for their 1972 UK album We'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.[90] Punk band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc contributed a cover of \"Ticket to Ride\" to NME's Big Four, an EP distributed free with the 1 February 1986 issue of NME magazine.[91] Johnny Black paired this version with the Carpenters' hit recording as examples of how the Lennon\u2013McCartney song continues to endure.[21] Echo & the Bunnymen recorded \"Ticket to Ride\" in 2001, creating a version that Vulture.com later included among its ten best Beatles covers.[92] That same year, Beatallica parodied the song on their A Garage Dayz Nite track \"Everybody's Got a Ticket to Ride Except for Me and My Lightning\".[43] Kids Incorporated covered \"Ticket to Ride\" in 1993 in the Season 9 episode \"Face Your Fears\".[93]\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, the line-up on the Beatles' recording was as follows:[4]",

        "text": "Dr. Susan Lewis, played by Sherry Stringfield, is a fictional doctor on the television show ER.\nSusan is one of ER's original characters, first seen in Season 1 as an eager resident. She left County General Hospital and the series in Season 3, but returned five seasons later as an attending physician in Season 8. Susan Lewis eventually checked out of the ER for good in 2005 at the beginning of Season 12, having been passed over for tenure in favor of John Carter by Kerry Weaver. She was offered a tenured position at a hospital in Iowa. She returned in the final episode. Susan is left handed.\nIn Season 1, Susan is a second year resident. She is shown to be an eager and competent young doctor working in the emergency department of County General Hospital. She is good friends with Nurse Carol Hathaway, Dr. Doug Ross and especially Dr. Mark Greene, who is her best friend.\nThough an extremely capable doctor, Susan is initially seen to have problems asserting herself. This is frequently taken advantage of by the senior and more forthright doctors in the hospital, such as Dr. Peter Benton and particularly Dr. Jack Kayson. This leads to several confrontations, and animosity worsens when Kayson discharges one of Susan's patients, failing to notice the severity of his symptoms, which ultimately leads to the patient's death. Kayson tries to deflect the blame onto Susan and her competence is questioned. Her superior, Mark, is forced to monitor her every move and their friendship is put under strain as a result. During the case review, however, the board rules in Susan's favor and reprimands Kayson\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmuch to his chagrin. Shortly after, Kayson is rushed into hospital suffering from a heart attack. Despite their past disagreement on the issue, Kayson opts for Susan's non-invasive form of treatment against the advice of a senior doctor, who (like Kayson) is an advocate of surgical angioplasty. Finally asserting herself, Susan stands her ground and refuses to allow Kayson to be treated surgically. Following his recovery, Kayson shows his gratitude by asking Susan to be his valentine date, which she awkwardly declines.\nSusan's personal life is far less settled than her professional one. In Season 1, she is seen to have a brief relationship with psychiatrist Div Cvetic, who ultimately has a nervous breakdown and disappears. Susan later learns that he married someone he met through a dating service, run by a taxi driver from his cab. Most of her problems, however, are family-related. Susan's parents, Cookie and Henry, are shown to be flighty (her father is jokingly referred to as a test pilot for Barcalounger) and difficult to talk to. Her older sister, Chloe, is the source of most of her distress, with a seemingly never ending series of problems with alcohol, drugs, men, and money.\nChloe eventually has a baby girl, who she names Susan (\"Little Susie\") after her sister. During Season 2 however, Chloe begins to use alcohol and drugs once again. After deciding that she cannot look after her baby, she leaves Chicago, abandoning Susie on a flustered and overworked Susan, who struggles to be a good mother to the child while completing her demanding residency. Already overstressed, Susan clashes with the new Chief Resident, Kerry Weaver, numerous times, forcing Mark Greene to step in between them. Animosity between Kerry and Susan lessens over time, but never goes away completely.\nRealizing that Chloe may never return, Susan considers giving Susie up for adoption. She gets as far as introducing the baby to potential adoptive parents, but cannot bring herself to part with her niece, so she decides to keep her and adopt the child as her own. Susan grows extremely attached to the baby, but she gets a surprise when a reformed Chloe reappears later in the season and tries to reclaim \"little Susie\". Susan can't see past Chloe's mistakes, regardless of her recent turnaround and new responsible boyfriend. Desperate to keep the baby, Susan attempts to fight Chloe for custody, but is forced to reconsider when the judge warns her that she would lose. Susan begrudgingly reaches an agreement with her sister, and after regaining custody of \"little Susie\", Chloe moves her family to Phoenix, Arizona to start a new life. Susan struggles to cope with the loss of her niece and goes through a period of grief and counseling. She throws herself into her work to escape her feelings of loneliness, which manages to impress Weaver and, with Mark's encouragement, Kerry agrees to offer Susan the position of chief resident (she promises to support Susan's promotion if Mark recommends her as County's new attending physician). Much of the ER staff hoped Susan could achieve that title, but Susan turns the position down, later telling Mark that there is more to life than work.\nSetting up Sherry Stringfield's departure from the series in Season 3, the beginnings of a romance appears to develop between Susan and Mark, or more to the point, they are shown to have problems identifying their current relationship as friendship. Both seem timid and cautious around each other. Initially more upfront about the situation, Susan invites Mark to join her on holiday in Maui, Hawaii, but is embarrassed when he appears hesitant, and later retracts the offer, feeling she overstepped a boundary. Fearful that he may have missed his chance with Susan, Mark attempts to convey his attraction towards her upon her return, though he cannot find the courage to follow through and is left perplexed by Susan's reticence. It transpires that Susan never actually made it to Maui, she instead visited her sister and \"little Susie\" in Phoenix as she could not overcome her fear of flying. Mark helps her overcome this fear in the following episode (\"Fear of Flying\"), supporting her during a helicopter flight rotation where they are called upon to treat victims of a serious motor accident. As they grow closer, Mark finally plucks up the courage to casually ask Susan out, however she declines, telling him that they \"need to talk\". Shortly after, Mark witnesses Susan in numerous secret talks with the ER's chief of emergency medicine, David Morgenstern, and concludes that they are seeing each other. He confronts Susan, but she reveals that Morgenstern was merely helping her to transfer her residency. Desperately missing her niece, Susan had made the decision to move to Phoenix to be near her sister's family. During a hectic last day for Susan at County's ER, Mark struggles with her imminent departure, but still finds himself afraid to admit his true feelings for her. The hospital staff arrange a leaving party for Susan, but it is canceled due to an influx of critical patients from a motoring accident. Susan leaves the hospital unable to say goodbye to Mark, who was busy working on a trauma patient. She departs the season on a train in the episode 'Union Station', discovering Mark's true feelings for her as he catches her before she gets aboard, pleading with her to stay because he loves her. Despite Mark laying his heart on the line, Susan doesn't see a future in Chicago or with him. She kisses him and says \"I love you, too\" as the train departs.\nSusan returns during Season 8 as she left, shown to arrive on a train into Chicago to interview for a job. Susan visits County General for the first time in 5 years and sees the hospital has changed as well as the faces. She meets Mark for coffee and reveals that Chloe has moved on to another city, and she has decided that she can't follow her sister's family around forever. Mark offers her a job as an attending physician at County General, despite Kerry Weaver's reservations\u00a0\u2013 the two never got along when they worked together before.\nDuring Season 8 Susan has a brief relationship with Dr. John Carter after they both admit that they had a crush on each other when he was a medical student and she was a resident\u00a0\u2013 it doesn't last, as Susan realizes in the episode Secrets and Lies, that Carter is really in love with Abby Lockhart. She then tells Carter to \"tell her\" about his feelings. The two both break up on good terms and remain good friends throughout the rest of her career at County. Her problems with Chloe resurface when her niece Susie goes missing in New York after leaving a distressing voicemail message on her aunt's phone. Susan flies to New York (in a crossover with Third Watch) and discovers Chloe doped up, sleeping rough. Towards the end of the season, Susan faces one of her most difficult story lines, as her best friend Mark Greene reveals to her that his brain tumor has returned. The two rekindled their close friendship as she helps him come to terms with his diagnosis. Susan is alluded to in Mark's goodbye letter in The Letter when Mark comments that he had to leave the way he did, even though there were things of a more personal nature to say. After her best friend's death, Susan warmed up to other friendships in the ER with Abby Lockhart and Elizabeth Corday, and was able to work better with her old colleague Kerry Weaver. Dr. Romano also promoted her to Deputy Chief of Emergency Medicine much to Kerry Weaver's dismay.\nInto Season 9, Susan meets a flight nurse named Chuck Martin (played by Donal Logue) on a plane to Las Vegas. They both get drunk upon arrival and end up getting married in Vegas. They quickly have the marriage annulled once they return to Chicago, but eventually start dating again, and Susan becomes pregnant. She is finally promoted to the position of Chief of Emergency Medicine after Robert Romano dies in Season 10. While other pregnant characters had given birth on the show, at the time, Susan's was the first major birth offscreen, with her giving birth sometime between Seasons 10 and 11 (and being placed on bedrest amid concerns of preterm labor). Chuck ends up caring for their baby boy Cosmo as a stay-at-home parent while Susan works.\nInto Season 11, Susan begins to build some anxiety about the upcoming tenure offer. It ultimately goes to her friend John Carter, due to her lack of grant funding, finally leading to her final exit from the series at the beginning of Season 12 in the episode Canon City. Susan is offered a tenure track position at a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa (presumably University of Iowa). Technically, Stringfield was the first and last original cast member to leave the show. (Being the first to leave in 1996, then in 2005 after the rest of the original cast left.)\nIn the season 15 episode The Book of Abby, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag \"Lewis\" can be seen.\nDr. Susan Lewis returned for the series finale titled \"And in the End...\", returning to Chicago for the opening of The Carter Center. During evening drinks with Peter Benton, John Carter, Kerry Weaver, Elizabeth Corday, and Rachel Greene, Susan is heard confirming to Dr. Corday that she still lives in Iowa. Additionally, she states that she and Chuck have split and she is now dating again. She eventually returns to the ER for the last time in the series with Rachel Greene and Carter, where she visits and jokes with the staff, much to the annoyance of Dr. Banfield who interrupts the talk by asking Susan who she is.",

        "text": "Andreas Vesalius (/v\u026a\u02c8se\u026ali\u0259s/;[1] 31 December 1514 \u2013 15 October 1564) was a 16th-century Flemish anatomist, physician, and author of one of the most influential books on human anatomy, De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body). Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy. He was born in Brussels, which was then part of the Habsburg Netherlands. He was professor at the University of Padua and later became Imperial physician at the court of Emperor Charles V.\nAndreas Vesalius is the Latinized form of the Dutch Andries van Wesel. It was a common practice among European scholars in his time to Latinize their names. His name is also given as Andrea Vesalius, Andr\u00e9 V\u00e9sale, Andrea Vesalio, Andreas Vesal, Andr\u00e9 Vesalio and Andre Vesalepo.\nVesalius was born as Andries van Wesel to his father Andries van Wesel and mother Isabel Crabbe on 31 December 1514 in Brussels, which was then part of the Habsburg Netherlands. His great grandfather, Jan van Wesel, probably born in Wesel, received a medical degree from the University of Pavia and taught medicine in 1528 at the University of Leuven. His grandfather, Everard van Wesel, was the Royal Physician of Emperor Maximilian, while his father, Anders van Wesel, served as apothecary to Maximilian, and later valet de chambre to his successor Charles V. Anders encouraged his son to continue in the family tradition, and enrolled him in the Brethren of the Common Life in Brussels to learn Greek and Latin prior to learning medicine, according to standards of the era.[citation needed]\nIn 1528 Vesalius entered the University of Leuven (Pedagogium Castrense) taking arts, but when his father was appointed as the Valet de Chambre in 1532, he decided instead to pursue a career in the military at the University of Paris, where he relocated in 1533. There he studied the theories of Galen under the auspices of Jacques Dubois (Jacobus Sylvius) and Jean Fernel. It was during this time that he developed an interest in anatomy, and he was often found examining excavated bones in the charnel houses at the Cemetery of the Innocents.\nVesalius was forced to leave Paris in 1536 owing to the opening of hostilities between the Holy Roman Empire and France and returned to Leuven. He completed his studies there under Johann Winter von Andernach and graduated the following year. His thesis, Paraphrasis in nonum librum Rhazae medici arabis clariss. ad regem Almansorum de affectuum singularum corporis partium curatione, was a commentary on the ninth book of Rhazes. He remained at Leuven only a short time before leaving after a dispute with his professor. After settling briefly in Venice in 1536, he moved to the University of Padua (Universitas artistarum) to study for his medical doctorate, which he received in 1537.\nOn the day of his graduation he was immediately offered the chair of surgery and anatomy (explicator chirurgiae) at Padua. He also guest-lectured at the Bologna and the Pisa. Prior to taking up his position in Padua, Vesalius traveled through Italy, and assisted the future Pope Paul IV and Ignatius of Loyola to heal those afflicted by Hansen\u2019s disease (leprosy). In Venice, he met the illustrator Johan van Calcar, a student of Titian. It was with van Calcar that Vesalius published his first anatomical text, Tabulae Anatomicae Sex, in 1538.[2] Previously these topics had been taught primarily from reading classical texts, mainly Galen, followed by an animal dissection by a barber\u2013surgeon whose work was directed by the lecturer. No attempt was made to confirm Galen's claims, which were considered unassailable. Vesalius, in contrast, performed dissection as the primary teaching tool, handling the actual work himself and urging students to perform dissection themselves. Hands-on direct observation was, considered the only reliable resource, a huge break with medieval practice, which prohibited human dissection.\nVesalius created detailed illustrations of anatomy for students in the form of six large woodcut posters. When he found that some of them were being widely copied, he published them all in 1538 under the title Tabulae anatomicae sex. He followed this in 1539 with an updated version of Guinter's anatomical handbook, Institutiones anatomicae.\nIn 1539 he also published his Venesection letter on bloodletting. This was a popular treatment for almost any illness, but there was some debate about where to take the blood from. The classical Greek procedure, advocated by Galen, was to collect blood from a site near the location of the illness. However, the Muslim and medieval practice was to draw a smaller amount of blood from a distant location. Vesalius' pamphlet generally supported Galen's view, but with qualifications that rejected the infiltration of Galen.\nIn 1541 while in Bologna, Vesalius discovered that all of Galen's research had to be restricted to animals; since dissection had been banned in ancient Rome. Galen had dissected Barbary macaques instead, which he considered structurally closest to man. Even though Galen produced many errors due to the anatomical material available to him, he was a qualified examiner, but his research was weakened by stating his findings philosophically causing his facts to be based more on religion rather than science.[3] Vesalius contributed to the new Giunta edition of Galen's collected works and began to write his own anatomical text based on his own research. Until Vesalius pointed out Galen's substitution of animal for human anatomy, it had gone unnoticed and had long been the basis of studying human anatomy. However, some people still chose to follow Galen and resented Vesalius for calling attention to the difference.\nGalen had assumed that arteries carried the purest blood to higher organs such as the brain and lungs from the left ventricle of the heart, while veins carried blood to the lesser organs such as the stomach from the right ventricle. In order for this theory to be correct, some kind of opening was needed to interconnect the ventricles, and Galen claimed to have found them. So paramount was Galen's authority that for 1400 years a succession of anatomists had claimed to find these holes, until Vesalius admitted he could not find them. Nonetheless, he did not venture to dispute Galen on the distribution of blood, being unable to offer any other solution, and so supposed that it diffused through the unbroken partition between the ventricles.[4]\nOther famous examples of Vesalius disproving Galen's assertions were his discoveries that the lower jaw (mandible) was composed of only one bone, not two (which Galen had assumed based on animal dissection) and that humans lack the rete mirabile, a network of blood vessels at the base of the brain that is found in sheep and other ungulates.\nIn 1543, Vesalius conducted a public dissection of the body of Jakob Karrer von Gebweiler, a notorious felon from the city of Basel, Switzerland. He assembled and articulated the bones, finally donating the skeleton to the University of Basel. This preparation (\"The Basel Skeleton\") is Vesalius' only well-preserved skeletal preparation, and also the world's oldest surviving anatomical preparation. It is still displayed at the Anatomical Museum of the University of Basel.[5]\nIn the same year Vesalius took residence in Basel to help Johannes Oporinus publish the seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica (On the fabric of the human body), a groundbreaking work of human anatomy that he dedicated to Charles V. Many believe it was illustrated by Titian's pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar, but evidence is lacking, and it is unlikely that a single artist created all 273 illustrations in a period of time so short. At about the same time he published an abridged edition for students, Andrea Vesalii suorum de humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome, and dedicated it to Philip II of Spain, the son of the Emperor. That work, now collectively referred to as the Fabrica of Vesalius, was groundbreaking in the history of medical publishing and is considered to be a major step in the development of scientific medicine. Because of this, it marks the establishment of anatomy as a modern descriptive science.[6]\nThough Vesalius' work was not the first such work based on actual dissection, nor even the first work of this era, the production quality, highly detailed and intricate plates, and the likelihood that the artists who produced it were clearly present in person at the dissections made it an instant classic. Pirated editions were available almost immediately, an event Vesalius acknowledged in a printer's note would happen. Vesalius was 28 years old when the first edition of Fabrica was published.\nSoon after publication, Vesalius was invited to become imperial physician to the court of Emperor Charles V. He informed the Venetian Senate that he would leave his post in Padua, which prompted Duke Cosimo I de' Medici to invite him to move to the expanding university in Pisa, which he declined. Vesalius took up the offered position in the imperial court, where he had to deal with other physicians who mocked him for being a mere barber surgeon instead of an academic working on the respected basis of theory.\nIn the 1540s, shortly after entering in service of the emperor, Vesalius married Anne van Hamme, from Vilvorde, Belgium. They had one daughter, named Anne, who died in 1588.[7]\nOver the next eleven years Vesalius traveled with the court, treating injuries caused in battle or tournaments, performing postmortems, administering medication, and writing private letters addressing specific medical questions. During these years he also wrote the Epistle on the China root, a short text on the properties of a medical plant whose efficacy he doubted, as well as a defense of his anatomical findings. This elicited a new round of attacks on his work that called for him to be punished by the emperor. In 1551, Charles V commissioned an inquiry in Salamanca to investigate the religious implications of his methods. Although Vesalius' work was cleared by the board, the attacks continued. Four years later one of his main detractors and one-time professors, Jacobus Sylvius, published an article that claimed that the human body itself had changed since Galen had studied it.\nAfter the abdication of Emperor Charles V, Vesalius continued at court in great favor with his son Philip II, who rewarded him with a pension for life by making him a count palatine. In 1555 he published a revised edition of De humani corporis fabrica.\nIn 1564 Vesalius went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, some said, after being accused of dissecting a living body. He sailed with the Venetian fleet under James Malatesta via Cyprus. When he reached Jerusalem he received a message from the Venetian senate requesting him again to accept the Paduan professorship, which had become vacant on the death of his friend and pupil Fallopius.\nAfter struggling for many days with adverse winds in the Ionian Sea, he was shipwrecked on the island of Zakynthos.[8] Here he soon died, in such debt that a benefactor kindly paid for his funeral. At the time of his death he was scarcely fifty years of age. He was buried somewhere on the island of Zakynthos (Zante).[9]\nFor many years it was assumed that Vesalius's pilgrimage was due to pressures of the Inquisition. Today this assumption is generally considered to be without foundation[10] and is dismissed by modern biographers. It appears the story was spread by Hubert Languet, a diplomat under Emperor Charles V and then under the Prince of Orange, who claimed in 1565 that Vesalius had performed an autopsy on an aristocrat in Spain while the heart was still beating, leading to the Inquisition's condemning him to death. The story went on to claim that Philip II had the sentence commuted to a pilgrimage. The story re-surfaced several times over the next few years, living on until recent times.\nIn 1543, Vesalius asked Johannes Oporinus to publish the book De humani corporis fabrica (On the fabric of the human body), a groundbreaking work of human anatomy he dedicated to Charles V and which many believe was illustrated by Titian's pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar.\nAbout the same time he published another version of his great work, entitled De humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome (Abridgement of the Structure of the Human Body) more commonly known as the Epitome, with a stronger focus on illustrations than on text, so as to help readers, including medical students, to easily understand his findings. The actual text of the Epitome was an abridged form of his work in the Fabrica, and the organization of the two books was quite varied. He dedicated it to Philip II of Spain, son of the Emperor.[11]\nThe Fabrica emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the \"anatomical\" view of the body, seeing human internal functioning as a result of an essentially corporeal structure filled with organs arranged in three-dimensional space. His book contains drawings of several organs on two leaves. This allows for the creation of three-dimensional diagrams by cutting out the organs and pasting them on flayed figures.[6] This was in stark contrast to many of the anatomical models used previously, which had strong Galenic/Aristotelean elements, as well as elements of astrology. Although modern anatomical texts had been published by Mondino and Berenger, much of their work was clouded by reverence for Galen and Arabian doctrines.\nBesides the first good description of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six, and described accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone. He not only verified Estienne's observations on the valves of the hepatic veins, but also described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named the ductus venosus. He described the omentum and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon; gave the first correct views of the structure of the pylorus; observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura and the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain up to that time. He did not understand the inferior recesses, and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth, and the fifth as the seventh.\nIn this work, Vesalius also becomes the first person to describe mechanical ventilation.[12] It is largely this achievement that has resulted in Vesalius being incorporated into the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists college arms and crest.\nWhen I undertake the dissection of a human pelvis I pass a stout rope tied like a noose beneath the lower jaw and through the zygomas up to the top of the head... The lower end of the noose I run through a pulley fixed to a beam in the room so that I may raise or lower the cadaver as it hangs there or turn around in any direction to suit my purpose; ... You must take care not to put the noose around the neck, unless some of the muscles connected to the occipital bone have already been cut away.[13]\nIn 1538, Vesalius wrote Epistola, docens venam axillarem dextri cubiti in dolore laterali secandam (A letter, teaching that in cases of pain in the side, the axillary vein of the right elbow be cut), commonly known as the Venesection Letter, which demonstrated a revived venesection, a classical procedure in which blood was drawn near the site of the ailment. He sought to locate the precise site for venesection in pleurisy within the framework of the classical method. The real significance of the book is his attempt to support his arguments by the location and continuity of the venous system from his observations rather than appeal to earlier published works. With this novel approach to the problem of venesection, Vesalius posed the then striking hypothesis that anatomical dissection might be used to test speculation.\nIn 1546, three years after the Fabrica, he wrote his Epistola rationem modumque propinandi radicis Chynae decocti, commonly known as the Epistle on the China Root. Ostensibly an appraisal of a popular but ineffective treatment for gout, syphilis, and stone, this work is especially important as a continued polemic against Galenism and a reply to critics in the camp of his former professor Jacobus Sylvius, now an obsessive detractor.\nIn February 1561, Vesalius was given a copy of Gabriele Fallopio's Observationes anatomicae, friendly additions and corrections to the Fabrica. Before the end of the year Vesalius composed a cordial reply, Anatomicarum Gabrielis Fallopii observationum examen, generally referred to as the Examen. In this work he recognizes in Fallopio a true equal in the science of dissection he had done so much to create. Vesalius' reply to Fallopio was published in May 1564, a month after Vesalius' death on the Greek island of Zante (now called Zakynthos).\nThe influence of Vesalius' plates representing the partial dissections of the human figure posing in a landscape setting is apparent in the anatomical plates prepared by the Baroque painter Pietro da Cortona (1596\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1669), who executed anatomical plates with figures in dramatic poses, most of them with architectural or landscape backdrops.[15]\nDuring the 20th century, the American artist, Jacob Lawrence created his Vesalius Suite based on the anatomical drawings of Andreas Vesalius.\n\"De Fabrica received a mixed reception when it first appeared; strict Galenists deplored its attacks on their master, while other anatomists, particularly in Italy, praised it as an important contribution\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe reaction that was ultimately to carry the day,\" concludes Katharine Park her Commentary in the 1998 De Fabrica.[16]\nLike Darwin three centuries later, Vesalius was going up against the towering authority of a tradition stretching back to the ancients\u2014here specifically the work of Galen \u2014 with only his experience on his side. He knew what his eyes saw and his hands felt, and concluded that traditional belief was wrong. In his publications we see Vesalius doing everything he can think of to bolster his authoritative image: publishing a huge monument to himself, but presenting the work using Galen\u2019s own flowchart; presenting himself as personal physician to the emperor and having himself depicted in a commanding position on the title page of the book; augmenting his words with illustration after illustration and recommending the experiential road to all his students far and wide. His guarantee: if you doubt what I say and show here, do your own anatomy, see for yourself and your experience will be like mine. The authority of experience won out against the authority of ancient sources and a new era dawned upon Europe.\nSimultaneously Vesalius\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work was part of one of the earliest known public health programs. The Council of Doges in Venice responded to the Bubonic Plague in the mid-14th century by directing the University of Padua Medical School to devote itself to discovering the causes of plague, how it spreads, how it develops in the individual, and if possible how victims might be cured. It ultimately took three centuries to find the solution, but with Venice leading the way plague was eventually eliminated as a major killer across Europe.[16][17]",

        "text": "Star Wars: The Force Awakens (also known as Star Wars: Episode VII \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Force Awakens) is a 2015 American epic space opera film produced, co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams. It is the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy and the seventh main installment of the Star Wars franchise, following Return of the Jedi (1983). The film stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow, and was produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions. The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to not involve franchise creator George Lucas. Set 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the film follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight alongside the Resistance, led by veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire.\nThe Force Awakens was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, the composer for the previous six films, returned to compose the film's score. Lucas served as creative consultant during the film's early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, and concluded in November 2014. It is the first live-action Star Wars film since Revenge of the Sith (2005).\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens was widely anticipated, and Disney backed the film with extensive marketing campaigns. It premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015 before its wide release in the United States on December 18. The film received highly positive reviews from critics, with praise aimed at its ensemble cast, Abrams' direction, musical score, visual effects, and action sequences, although it received criticism for being derivative of the original trilogy. The film broke various box office records and became, unadjusted for inflation, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise, the highest-grossing film in North America, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $2\u00a0billion and a net profit of over $780\u00a0million.[6][7] It received five Academy Award nominations and four British Academy Film Award nominations, where it won the award for Best Special Visual Effects. It was followed by The Last Jedi in December 2017, with a third film scheduled for release in 2019.\nThirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes them while Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker.\nResistance pilot Poe Dameron meets village elder Lor San Tekka on the planet Jakku to obtain a map to Luke's location. Stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren destroy the village and capture Poe, while Kylo kills Tekka. Poe's droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named Rey near a junkyard settlement. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force, and learns of BB-8. Reticent stormtrooper FN-2187 frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter; Poe dubs FN-2187 \"Finn\". They crash on Jakku; Finn survives, but he believes that Poe was killed in the crash. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 flee the planet in the Millennium Falcon, which they steal from a junkyard.\nThe Falcon is captured by a larger ship piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, looking to reclaim their former vessel. Two rival gangs, seeking to settle debts with Han, board and attack, but Han and his allies flee in the Falcon. The gangs inform the First Order. At the First Order's Starkiller Base \u2013 a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses energy from stars \u2013 Supreme Leader Snoke allows General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Kylo says Han means nothing to him.\nThe Falcon crew views BB-8's map and determines it is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered all the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers assistance in getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn to a vault on the lower level and finds the lightsaber that once belonged to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods.

Abrams, appears as Captain Cypress.[71] The film's dialect coach, Andrew Jack, appears as Major Ematt of the Resistance.[72] Additionally, Crystal Clarke, Pip Andersen,[73] Christina Chong,[74] Miltos Yerolemou,[75] Amybeth Hargreaves,[76] Leanne Best,[77] Judah Friedlander,[78] and Kevin Smith[79] were cast in minor roles. Abrams has a vocal cameo,[80] singing with Lin-Manuel Miranda on two songs, \"Jabba Flow\" and \"Dobra Doompa\", performed by Shag Kava, consisting of Abrams, Miranda and musicians.[81][82] Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels cast members Dee Bradley Baker, Matt Lanter, Tom Kane, Catherine Taber, Matthew Wood, Sam Witwer, Meredith Salenger, James Arnold Taylor, show runner Dave Filoni, Michael Donovan, Devon Libran, Elle Newlands, Terri Douglas, Robert Stambler, Verona Blue, TJ Falls, Michelle Rejwan, Eugene Byrd, Fred Tatasciore, David Collins, Amanda Foreman, Christopher Scarabosio, Patrick Correll, Karen Huie, Orly Schuchmacher, Emily Towers, Jonathan Dixon, Kat Sheridan, Salacious Crumb actor Mark Dodson, and Gavyn Sykes actor Christian Simpson were the additional voices used in the film.[66][83] Riot control stormtrooper FN-2199, who calls Finn a traitor during the battle on Takodana, was portrayed by stunt performer Liang Yang and voiced by sound editor David Acord.[84]\nStar Wars creator George Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it.[85] In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm, and with it the Star Wars franchise, to The Walt Disney Company.[86] Speaking alongside Lucasfilm's new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: \"I always said I wasn't going to do any more and that's true, because I'm not going to do any more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.\"[87]\nAs creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe.[86] Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIX, which Lucas requested would only be read by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan Horn, and Kevin Mayer.[88] Lucas later stated that Disney had discarded his story ideas[89][90] and that he had no further involvement with the film.[91] Lucas' son Jett told The Guardian that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise, despite having picked Abrams to direct, and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation\".[92]\nThe Force Awakens's first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.[93][94][95][96] Early drafts had Luke appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\"[97] Luke became the film's MacGuffin and does not appear in person until the final scene.[97] Several directors were considered, including David Fincher,[98] Brad Bird,[99] Ben Affleck and Guillermo del Toro;[100] after a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy,[101] J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.[102][103]\nArndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.[96] The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties.[104] Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release.[105] He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks.[106] Abrams said that the key for the film was to return to the roots of the first Star Wars film and be based more on emotion than explanation.[107] In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.[108] In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe, though other elements could be included as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.[109]\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from The Force Awakens, such as Finn and Rey's last names and their backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams is collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with Episode IX's then-director Colin Trevorrow, to ensure a smooth transition and that \"everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\".[110] A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\"; Forsberg developed the language by studying languages such as Hindi and Gujarati.[111]\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been \"keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\"[112] He also stated: \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different\u00a0\u2026 I made them completely different\u2014different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\"[113][114] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and \"liked it\".[115] In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: \"I think the fans are going to love it, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for.\"[116] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film had \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.[117]\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that The Force Awakens would be filmed in the United Kingdom.[118] Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce The Force Awakens in the UK.[118] Osborne committed \u00a325\u00a0million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and the film industry.[119] According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, The Force Awakens ultimately received a total of \u00a331.6\u00a0million ($47.4\u00a0million) from the government.[4][3]\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of The Force Awakens for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[120] The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness.[121] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[122] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[123] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Daniel Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett and Matthew Cunnelly, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.[124][125][126][127]\nCasting began around August 2013, with Abrams meeting with potential actors for script readings and screen tests. Open auditions were held in the UK, Ireland, and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas.[128][129][130] Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.[131] Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement on April 29, 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks prior. Actors testing had strict non-disclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or publicists from commenting on their potential involvement.[132]\nThough Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013,[86] their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.[36] Saoirse Ronan,[133] Michael B. Jordan,[134] and Lupita Nyong'o[135] auditioned for new characters; industry publications reported Jesse Plemons was considered, possibly for Luke Skywalker's son;[136] Adam Driver for an unnamed villain;[137] and Maisie Richardson-Sellers for an unknown character.[138] In March 2014, actor Dominic Monaghan said that Abrams was looking for three unknown actors to play the leads in The Force Awakens and that rumors of bigger-name stars were untrue.[139]\nDaisy Ridley was chosen for the film by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his Girls schedule. By March 2014, talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began and continued into April 2014. In April, John Boyega began talks after dropping out of a Jesse Owens biopic.[132] Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, stating that it would have \"bored\" him.[140]\nOn April 29, 2014, the cast was announced with a photo of the first table read of the script at Pinewood Studios near London,[36] picturing director Abrams with Ford, Ridley, Fisher, Peter Mayhew, producer Bryan Burk, Lucasfilm president and producer Kathleen Kennedy, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Hamill, Serkis, Oscar Isaac, Boyega, Driver, and writer Lawrence Kasdan. The announcement was originally planned for May 4 (Star Wars Day), but was announced early for fear of media leaks. In June 2014, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.[141]\nTo prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.[142] Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.[142] Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO,[143] but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO suit to accommodate him.[144]\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the Star Wars set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.[145] In October 2014, Warwick Davis, who played Wald and Weazle in The Phantom Menace and Wicket in Return of the Jedi, announced that he would appear in The Force Awakens, but did not reveal his role.[146] In November 2014, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, is in the film.[61] Isaac's uncle, a Star Wars fan, was cast as an extra at the invitation of Abrams upon visiting the set.[147]\nIn December 2015, The Mail reported that Ford would be paid $25\u00a0million, plus a 0.5% share of the revenue. Ridley and Boyega each would receive $460,000, plus a share if the movie grossed over $1\u00a0billion. Fisher received $1.5\u00a0million; Abrams was paid $5.1\u00a0million, plus a 2% share of the revenue. For the original 1977 film, Ford was paid $10,000 (equivalent to $40,000 in 2017).[148]\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.[107] The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom.[149] That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.[150] In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,[151] filming in secret in the UAE emirate of Abu Dhabi by a second-unit.[152][153] Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65mm IMAX format.[154] In July, Bad Robot reported on Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.[155]\nOn May 4, 2014 (Star Wars Day), the studio posted a selfie taken by Iger with an unidentified actor in a Chewbacca costume.[156] Iger stated the photo was taken when he visited Pinewood Studios two weeks earlier to discuss the shoot, \"which was just about to start\", with Abrams, Kennedy, and Horn.[157] Principal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.[158][159][160] Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early-May, where large sets were built on location \u2013 including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market \u2013 and where explosives were used to create a \"blast crater\". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.[161] Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.[162]\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon set fell on him and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle\".[96] Production was suspended for two weeks to accommodate Ford's injury.[163] Ford's son Ben stated that the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.[164] A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said that Ford was recovering rapidly.[165] Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident.[96] However, he kept this to himself and did not tell anyone about it for over a month.[166] In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.[167] Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95\u00c2\u00a0million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.[168]\nStoryboard artists Simon Duric said \"The security on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe. Most of the time on a film you can sit at your desk with a copy of the script next to you. On this, you couldn't. That's fine but it was tricky in places. We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts. If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in a big black sheet. We were told in an email to be [wary] of drones.\"[169]\nIn July 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.[170][171] Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the north west of England.[172] Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford during mid-August.[173][174] In September 2014, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships from the Star Wars Universe.[175][176] Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean was used for forest scenes.[177][178] Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.[179]\nCinematographer Daniel Mindel stated that The Force Awakens would use real locations and scale models over computer-generated imagery to make it aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy.[180] Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\"[181] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars.[182] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research,[183] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[184][185]\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's Star Wars films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.[186]\nAbrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.[96] In August 2015, Abrams gave the estimated running time of the film as 124\u00e2\u20ac\u201c125 minutes.[187] Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value, except to be sitting around.\"[188] The film was converted to 3D in post-production.[189]\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to compose the score.[191] The music for the film's first two trailers was reworked from earlier Williams compositions.[192][193][194] He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.[194][195] In May 2015, Williams stated that he would return to themes from the previous films, such as ones for Luke, Leia and Han, in ways that \"will seem very natural and right in the moments for which we've chosen to do these kinds of quotes. There aren't many of them, but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.[190]\nRecording sessions for The Force Awakens began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.[196] The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.[197] Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings.[198][199]\nWilliams said the recording process was \"very luxurious\", with 12 sessions scattered over a five-month period between June and November. The score was recorded by the Hollywood Studio Symphony, a freelance orchestra, with sessions continuing on and off over that five-month period. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music, although nearly an hour of that was discarded, modified, or rerecorded as Abrams re-edited the film. Williams's theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus. Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.[200] Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.[194][195][201] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.[202] Williams's score is more than two hours long.[195]\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene, similar to the Mos Eisley Cantina. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical Hamilton, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose the cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score for the film. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two began to collaborate on the music for the scene, over a period of two months.[203]\nSouth Korean boy band EXO released their song \"Lightsaber\" in collaboration with the film for its release in their home country on November 11.[204] The promoted track was subsequently released as part of their Sing for You album with a Chinese version,[205] as well as being released in Japanese.[206] Chinese pop singer Luhan provided the Chinese theme \"Inner Force\" for the Chinese release of the film.[207]\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre and Dolby Theatre on December 14, 2015.[208] A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the \"massive\" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests.[209] The film was released in 12 countries, including European nations (such as Italy and France, releasing it on a Wednesday), the Philippines and Thailand on December 16; 32 countries including the United Kingdom (releasing on a Thursday), Mexico and additional European, Asian, African, South American and Oceania countries on December 17; and in North America, Japan, Spain, and Venezuela on December 18,[210] in 3D and IMAX 3D.[211] It was released in India on December 25[212] and in China on January 9, 2016.[210]\nIn North America, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations,[213][214] as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (High dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema.[215] Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record.[214] On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in North America for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros. Pictures' The Hobbit trilogy to receive such a release.[216] The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of The Revenant and The Finest Hours in mid-January 2016.[217]\nOn November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[218] Similarly to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, \"Episode VII\" was included in the film's opening crawl, but not in its official title.[219][220] In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the Star Wars universe, revealed that the working title for the film was Shadow of the Empire \"for the longest time\".[221] Advance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015,[222] and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing.[223][224] Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater.[225] In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5\u00a0million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1\u00a0million in pre-sales on a single day.[226] In total it sold over $50\u00a0million in pre-sales breaking the record.[227][228] This number was raised to $100\u00a0million including $50\u201360\u00a0million in advance ticket sales by December 14.[228][229] However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening\u2026 We have people buying Star Wars [The Force Awakens] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.\"[227] Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK,[230] Canada,[231] and Germany.[232]\nThe film is the first live-action Star Wars film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.[233] Shortly following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, the studio had indicated that the then-untitled film would be released under the \"Disney|Lucasfilm\" branding,[234] similar to the branding used for Star Wars Rebels, and akin to the \"Disney\u00b7Pixar\" co-branding of Pixar-produced films released by Walt Disney Pictures.[235] Ultimately, Disney's logo was largely absent from the film's marketing\u2014but nonetheless, appeared on merchandise\u2014and the film was released with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles;[236] Disney chairman Bob Iger explained the change by saying it was \"for the fans\".[237]\nDisney backed The Force Awakens with extensive marketing campaigns.[238][239] On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store,[240] generating a record 58.2\u00a0million views on YouTube in its first week.[241] Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. The Hollywood Reporter called the trailer \"perfectly potent nostalgia\", praising its mix of old and new.[242] Empire was impressed by the continuity with the first films \u2013 \"the feel of classic Star Wars\" \u2013 but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters.[243] The Guardian wrote that the use of the Star Wars fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.[244]\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters.[245] On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was \"staggering\u2026 the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to \u2013 other than a rock concert \u2013 that felt quite like that\".[246] The trailer was viewed over 88\u00a0million times within the first 24 hours of release, breaking the record.[247][248] According to the Guinness World Records, the second teaser trailer amassed 30.65\u00a0million in 24 hours, setting a new world record for the \"most viewed movie trailer on YouTube in 24 hours\".[249] The event was broadcast live by Verizon on YouTube, StarWars.com and in movie theaters. The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. The Huffington Post's Graham Milne wrote that the trailer \"was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.\"[250]\nVanity Fair was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to The Force Awakens. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz.[251][252] At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of The Guardian writing: \"The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.\" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, Super 8, saying \"the promos\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.\"[253]\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at The Force Awakens at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015.[254] Drew Struzan\u2014who designed the poster artwork for the previous Star Wars films\u2014produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees.[255] In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer.[256] The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like \"orb\".[257] The trailer debuted during the halftime break of Monday Night Football, before being released online.[258] The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was \"frenzied\", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that \"perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals.\"[259] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph felt the trailer was \"a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned Star Wars aesthetic\".[260] The trailer received 128\u00a0million views in 24 hours, a new record for the most views of a trailer in 24 hours. 16\u00a0million of the views came from its airing on Monday Night Football.[261] At the end of October, Air France announced a \"Flight and Cinema\" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France is one of the first countries to release the film.[262] On November 6, a Japanese trailer for the film was released.[263][264] After seeing the new trailer Forbes' Ollie Barder stated the trailer gave him \"hope\" that the film would not \"let us all down like the prequels did\u2026 [with] a worthwhile story this time\".[265] On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.[266]\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across North America aired a Star Wars marathon, airing the six previous Star Wars episode films in 2D, followed by The Force Awakens in 3D.

The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the Star Wars universe.[268][269][270] Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of The Force Awakens which was released in e-book form on December 18.[271] In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016.[271] Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of The Force Awakens between June and November 2016.[272]\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed \"Force Friday\" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for The Force Awakens. Beginning at 12:01\u00c2\u00a0am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world.[273] Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015.[274][275] Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero.[183] Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling.[276][277] Many retailers were unable to meet demand for Star Wars products.[278]\nThe Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to not have a direct tie-in game to accompany it.[279] Instead, select characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other Star Wars video games, as described below:\nEventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in the summer of 2016.[284] In addition to fully adapting the film, the game includes bonus levels that take place a few years before the events of the film.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Star Wars: The Force Awakens via download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, with a Blu-ray and DVD release on April 5.[285] The home media release contains additional footage.[286] As with the videodisc releases of all of the first six films in the saga, the videodisc release of The Force Awakens splits the film into fifty chapters.[287] On March 23, 2016, the film was leaked online prior to its original Blu-ray release and was downloaded more than two million times in twelve hours.[288]\nIn January 2016, it was confirmed that Starz would hold the U.S. premium television rights for The Force Awakens, having been released just before the end of Starz's output deal covering most Disney-released films, which includes releases through the end of 2015.[289][290] The Force Awakens will be broadcast on all the Starz channels beginning on September 10, 2016.[291] The equivalent rights in Canada will be held by Netflix.[292]\nA Blu-ray 3D \"collector's edition\" of the film was released on November 15, 2016, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by Abrams.

It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1\u00a0billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark, doing so in 12 days.[298][299] It was also the third film in history to surpass $2\u00a0billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.[300] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $780.1\u00a0million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the most profitable film of 2015 and the most profitable film in the last seven years.[301][302]\nThe Force Awakens was released in the United States and Canada on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57\u00a0million from Thursday night previews,[N 1] of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7\u00a0million from 391 screens.[306] On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1\u00a0million, marking the biggest single and opening day record[307] and the first time a film has earned more than $100\u00a0million in a single day.[308] Without Thursday night grosses, the film earned the second largest opening-day gross ($62.1\u00a0million).[309] In total, it earned a record $247,966,675 (surpassing the original Sunday weekend estimate of $238\u00a0million by almost $10\u00a0million) for its opening weekend from around 14,400 screens at 4,134 theaters, for an average of $59,982 per theater (or $17,220 per screen).[310] The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holder(s) Marvel's The Avengers ($207\u00a0million) and Jurassic World ($208\u00a0million).[311] The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1\u00a0million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters,[312][313] which nearly amounts to the $252.5\u00a0million total earned by Return of the Jedi \u2013 the 2nd lowest-grossing film in the series \u2013 in its original run.[314] Minus the $57\u00a0million it earned from Thursday previews, the film earned $190.8\u00a0million on straight Friday to Sunday, giving it an average of $63.6\u00a0million per day.[309] 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78\u00a0million of the opening gross, setting a new record.[312] Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($59,982 per theater from 4,134 theaters),[315] biggest holiday opening,[316] biggest PG-13 rated opening,[317] and biggest December opening.[318] The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 58% of the audience male, 71% adults, 20% families and 9% teenagers.[309]\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.[319] It opened on December 16, 2015 in 12 international markets and earned $14.1\u00a0million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.[320] It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6\u00a0million for a two-day international total of $72.7\u00a0million, reaching first place in all 44 markets.[321] It grossed a total of $129.5\u00a0million in three days after adding $56.8\u00a0million on its third day, topped the daily box office in all countries except for South Korea and Vietnam where it was the second,[321][322] and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6\u00a0million.[323] It broke opening day records in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($14.3\u00a0million), Germany ($7.1\u00a0million), Australia ($6.8\u00a0million), Sweden ($1.7\u00a0million), Norway ($1.1\u00a0million) and in 16 other countries.[306][320][323][324] Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5\u00a0million), Mexico ($3.4\u00a0million), Italy ($3.1\u00a0million) and Japan ($3\u00a0million).[321] After the five days, The Force Awakens had a total international opening gross of $281\u00a0million from 30,000 screens in 72 markets, a new record for December opening[319][325] and the third biggest international opening of all time.[326] International markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10\u00a0million were the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($50.6\u00a0million), Germany ($27.5\u00a0million), France ($22.5\u00a0million), Australia ($19.6\u00a0million) and Japan ($13.4\u00a0million) and Russia ($12.3\u00a0million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia and Sweden.[319][327] IMAX generated $17.9\u00a0million from 276 IMAX theaters.[313]\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529\u00a0million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening, making it only the second time in cinematic history \u2013 after Jurassic World \u2013 that a film had opened to more than $500\u00a0million globally.[325][328] This included an IMAX opening record of $48\u00a0million.[328]\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2\u00a0million, to remain in first place at the box office[329] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.[330] Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19\u00a0million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70\u00a0million in 10 days.[331] Internationally, the film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9\u00a0million.[332] Of the notable major markets, the film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51\u00a0million.[333] As of February 21, the largest markets outside of the United States and Canada are the United Kingdom ($180.7\u00a0million), China ($124.5\u00a0million), Germany ($109.7\u00a0million), Japan ($92.6\u00a0million) and France ($88.2\u00a0million).[334]\nThe Force Awakens crossed the $1\u00a0billion mark on the 12th day of its general release (December 26, 2015), making it the fastest film to reach this mark. It became the twenty-fourth film grossing more than $1\u00a0billion worldwide, and the fifth film of 2015 to do so, making 2015 the first year to have five films gross more than $1\u00a0billion.[331] The film experienced another decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 39.5% to $90.2\u00a0million domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[335] to set a third-weekend record.[336]\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following Avatar) to gross over $700\u00a0million in North America,[337] and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.[338] On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800\u00a0million domestically unadjusted for inflation,[339] and in the same weekend set a Saturday to Sunday opening weekend record for the studio in China with $52.6\u00a0million.[340] On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1\u00a0billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.[341] It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avengers: Age of Ultron to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by The Revenant in its sixth weekend.[342] In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.[342]\nOn February 5, the fiftieth day of release, The Force Awakens became the first film to earn over $900\u00a0million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada.[343][344] On the following day, it became the third film in cinematic history to pass $2\u00a0billion in ticket sales worldwide (after Titanic and Avatar) and the second in original release (after Avatar).[345] It became the third film to earn over $600\u00a0million in Europe.[345] In North America and the United Kingdom and Ireland, it fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26\u201328, 2016,[346][347] and in the U.S. it did not achieve $1\u00a0million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.[348]\nWith a production budget of $306\u00a0million,[2] plus $175\u00a0million for marketing, printing and advertising costs, The Force Awakens was predicted to be a major box office success.[349] The cost of the film was subsidized by \u00a331.6\u00a0million ($47\u00a0million USD) from the UK film incentive program.[4] Total costs, after accounting for profit participations, production and distribution of home videos, as well as other ancillary mediums, is expected to run $423\u00a0million.[350] Reports in April 2015 from The Hollywood Reporter and Amboee Brand Intelligence predicted the film would earn up to $540\u00a0million worldwide for its opening, breaking the record for the biggest worldwide opening, as well as breaking the record for the biggest U.S. opening. They believed that The Force Awakens would have the widest release ever, across 4,500 theaters in North America.[351] Instead, it received a total of 4,134 theaters, and had the widest December opening.[213] Box office analyst Phil Contrino likened the film to Avatar (2009), which opened to $77\u00a0million in North America and went on to earn $2.8\u00a0billion worldwide, saying The Force Awakens would earn $1\u00a0billion \"without blinking\" and could gross $2\u00a0billion.[351] In August 2015, Deadline.com predicted an opening weekend of $615\u00a0million worldwide could be possible, including a $300\u00a0million opening in North America.[352] In November, box office analysts reported opening weekend projections were at $175\u2013250\u00a0million.[213][353][354] In December, capital analyst Barton Crockett suggested that the film will be the first to gross over $3\u00a0billion worldwide at the box office.[355]\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first Star Wars film made more when this adjustment is made.[356] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[356] Box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that while Avatar and The Force Awakens were both released on the same date of December 18, higher ticket prices in 2015 and IMAX screenings could push Star Wars \"into the box office stratosphere\".[357] On December 23, Mark Hughes of Forbes stated that The Force Awakens had matched the most optimistic projections for its opening, and he predicted that The Force Awakens would likely surpass Titanic as the second-highest-grossing film of all time. He commented that The Force Awakens could catch Avatar as the top-grossing film of all time, but only if it managed to avoid major week-to-week declines in ticket sales.[358]\nBy January 13, analysts concluded that it was unlikely that The Force Awakens would surpass Avatar's global gross.[359][360] While The Force Awakens was very successful in North America, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as Germany, India, Latin America, and parts of Asia. One cited reason for this is that overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in the U.S.[359][360][361] The Star Wars franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for The Force Awakens heavily focused on appealing to that market.[360][362] Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter stated that, for these territories, Star Wars \"doesn't have the same legacy as it does in North America and more mature markets. It's also a faster burn, meaning it likely won't stay in theaters as long as Avatar did.\"[359] Dergarabedian said, \"As in all box-office trajectories, the higher the altitude, the tougher it becomes to rack up sales at the kind of breakneck pace as in the beginning of the run.\"[359]\nNancy Tartaglione of Deadline.com argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, The Force Awakens did well overseas.[361] Avatar did well internationally because of its novelty, the marketing campaign advertising it as showcasing the newest 3D technology that can only be fully appreciated in the theaters, and because of its extended time in overseas theaters.[360] While The Force Awakens had appeal with its special effects, analysts feel that it lacked the novelty factor; they also cite that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done. Films do not play in overseas theaters as long as they did back when Avatar was released.[360] Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [The Force Awakens] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\"[359] Moreover, Mike Fleming of Deadline.com argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney an astounding $923M, and the Cash on Cash Return twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.31\".[363]\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.[364] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 93% approval rating based on 376 reviews, with a rating average of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy.\"[365] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 54 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[366] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, under-25s and under-18s gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it either an \"A\" or a \"B\".[367]\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave The Force Awakens five stars out of five and wrote that it \"sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past. That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\"[368] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it five stars out of five, writing that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot\u00a0\u2026 ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\"[369] Variety's Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans\".[370] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure\".[371] Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original Star Wars, it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind\u00a0\u2026 the energy, humor and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured\".[372] The Associated Press called it \"basically the same\" as the original film but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"[373]\nAnn Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans\u00a0\u2026 The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\"[374] Christopher Orr, writing in The Atlantic, called the film \"a mashup masterpiece\" that \"may be completely derivative\" but is \"a delight nonetheless\".[375] The Charlotte Observer's Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\"[376] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best Star Wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015\".[377] Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Money, found it was the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike\".[378] Jack Bottomley, writing for Starburst, awarded the film a 10 out of 10 score, saying \"From old joys to fresh twists, this is a unique blockbuster experience that celebrates the franchise whilst also expanding it.\"[379]\nSome critics found The Force Awakens was too derivative of the original Star Wars trilogy,[113] expressing in particular that the film is essentially a remake of A New Hope.[380][381] Andrew O'Hehir wrote for Salon that it was \"the work of a talented mimic or ventriloquist who can just about cover for the fact that he has nothing much to say\".[382] Stephanie Zacharek of TIME wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted\".[383] Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture\".[384] Brian Merchant of Motherboard wrote that \"Science fiction is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"[385]\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of The Force Awakens, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies.[386] However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards's slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors,[387] and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of The Force Awakens,[386] where it was named one of Top Ten Films of the year.[388]\nThe film received five Academy Award nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, including Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects.[389] The film garnered four nominations at the 69th British Academy Film Awards for Best Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Production Design, including two wins, one for Best Special Visual Effects and a BAFTA Rising Star Award for John Boyega.[390] It was nominated for Best Picture at the 2016 Critics' Choice Awards.[391] The film received seven Visual Effects Society Awards nominations, winning four, including Outstanding Visual Effects in an Effects Driven Feature Motion Picture.[392] It received the most nominations at the 21st Empire Awards, including Best Film, Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film, Best Director for J.J. Abrams, Best Male Newcomer for John Boyega, and Best Female Newcomer for Daisy Ridley.[393] It became the most nominated film in Saturn Award history with a total of 13 nominations at the 42nd Saturn Awards, where it won in eight categories, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Actor for Ford, Best Supporting Actor for Driver, Best Music, Best Special Effects, Best Editing, and Best Make-Up.[394][395]\nDaisy Ridley and John Boyega each received several nominations and accolades for their performances. They were nominated as Best Newcomers at various critics circle and associations, including the Alliance of Women Film Journalists,[396] and the Florida Film Critics Circle,[397] The Force Awakens received eleven nominations at the MTV Movie Awards, the most for the ceremony, including Movie of the Year, Best Female Performance for Ridley, Best Breakthrough Performance for Boyega, and Best Virtual Performance for Lupita Nyong'o and Andy Serkis.[398]\nIn addition to several awards and nominations, The Force Awakens appeared on various critics' lists of the ten best films of 2015.[399]\nRian Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct Episode VIII,[181] later titled The Last Jedi.[400] It was released on December 15, 2017.[401] Some second-unit filming took place in September 2015 in Ireland,[402][403] with principal photography beginning in February 2016 at Pinewood Studios.[404][405][406] Hamill, Fisher, Driver, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Serkis, Nyong'o, Gleeson, Daniels, Christie, Vee, and Suotamo reprised their roles in the film, and are joined by Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio del Toro.[407][38][38]\nEpisode IX is scheduled for release on December 20, 2019.[408] Abrams will direct the film and co-write it with Chris Terrio.[409]",

        "text": "Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He is one of only two players to win five Super Bowls (the other being defensive player Charles Haley) and the only player to win them all playing for one team.\nAfter playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest \"steal\" in the history of the NFL Draft.[1][2][3] In Brady's 16 seasons as a starter,[a] he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history.\nBrady has been honored with four Super Bowl MVP awards (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and LI), the most ever by a single player, has won three league MVP awards (2007, 2010, 2017), has been selected to 13 Pro Bowls, and has led his team to more division titles (15) than any other quarterback in NFL history. As of the end of the 2017 regular season, Brady is fourth all-time in total career passing yards, tied for third (with Drew Brees) in career touchdown passes[6], and third in career passer rating. His career postseason record is 27\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, winning more playoff games than any other quarterback, and he has appeared in more playoff games than any player at any position. Brady has never had a losing season as a starting quarterback in the NFL. His combined regular-season and postseason wins are also the most of any quarterback in NFL history. Because of his accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[7][8][9][10]\nFor his alleged involvement in the highly publicized Deflategate football tampering scandal, Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 NFL season.[11] Subsequently, Brady went on to win Super Bowl LI and was awarded Super Bowl MVP that season.\nBrady was born in San Mateo, California, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia (n\u00e9e Johnson) and Thomas Brady, Sr.[12] He has three older sisters, named Nancy, Julie, and Maureen.[13] He was raised Catholic. His father is of Irish descent, while his mother has German, Norwegian, Polish and Swedish ancestry.[14] Brady's great-great-grandparents on his father's side, John and Bridget Brady, were Irish refugees from the Great Famine who moved to San Francisco from Boston prior to the American Civil War. They were accompanied by Bridget's sister Ann and her husband Lawrence Meegan, the parents of the 19th Century American Major League Baseball player \"Steady\" Pete Meegan. Brady's great uncle, Michael Buckley Jr. was, also, the first American prisoner of war during World War II.[14][15][16][17][18][19]\nIn the 1980s, Brady regularly attended San Francisco 49ers games at Candlestick Park, where he was a fan of quarterback Joe Montana; since then, Brady has mentioned Montana as his idol and one of his inspirations.[20] At the age of four, Brady attended the 1981 NFC Championship against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Montana threw The Catch to Dwight Clark.[21] As a child, Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo where he learned to throw the football from camp counselor and future NFL/AFL quarterback Tony Graziani.[22] He grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan.[23]\nBrady attended Jun\u00edpero Serra High School in San Mateo, where he graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral.[24] He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady's football career started as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was not good enough to start on the 0\u20138 JV team that had not scored a touchdown all year.[25] However, when the starting quarterback went down with an injury, he ascended to the starting position. He became the varsity starter his junior year and held the position until he graduated.[26] By Brady's senior year, he struggled getting on the radar of college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them out to schools he would consider attending.[27] This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.\nThe process of recruiting was much different during Brady's time, and athletes' rankings were not as prominent. In terms of recruiting in the 2000s, Brady would have been considered a four-star recruit. In essence, he was a highly rated prospect.[28] Brady was also on Blue Chip Illustrated as well as a Prep Football Report All-American selection.[29] Following his recruiting process he narrowed down his list to five main schools.[30] \"Probably the ones that we did hear from and ultimately pared the list to were Cal-Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Michigan, and Illinois,\" his father said.[30] As a Cal fan, his father hoped that Brady would attend the nearby Cal, where Brady was a silent commit, and be able to watch his son play.[31][32]\nBrady was also known as a great baseball player in high school.[33] He was a left-handed-hitting catcher with power. His skill set impressed MLB scouts, and he was drafted in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos.[25][34] The Expos projected Brady as a potential All-Star, and offered him money typical of a late second-round or early third-round pick.[35] Nevertheless, Brady was determined to play football at the next level. He was always more passionate about football, and when he found that there was significant interest in him, he decided to take the road of football.[30] Brady was recruited by Michigan assistant Bill Harris, and he signed to play for the University of Michigan in 1995.[36][37] He finished his high school football career completing 236 of 447 passes for 3,702 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also won All-State and All-Far West honors as well as the team's Most Valuable Player Award.[29]\nDuring the summers of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch.[38] He was inducted into the Junipero Serra High School Hall of Fame in 2003, joining fellow Serra High graduates Barry Bonds, Lynn Swann, Gregg Jefferies, Jim Fregosi, and his older sister Maureen, among many others.[29] When Brady revisited two weeks after Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, school administrators announced that they had named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium.[39]\nBrady played college football for the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999.[40][41] He was a backup quarterback for his first two years, while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season, which was capped by a victory in the Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship.[42] When he enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and he had an intense struggle to get some playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety, and even considered transferring to California.[43][44] He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance on the field.[45] Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: \"He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn't sure I could go.\"[46]\nUnder Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr, Brady battled for the starting job with Drew Henson[41] and ultimately started every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. During his first full year as starter, he set new Michigan records for most pass attempts and completions in a season, for a total of 214.[47] Brady was All-Big Ten honorable mention both seasons, and was the team captain in his senior year. The Wolverines won 20 of 25 games when he started, and he set a school record for completions in a 31\u201316 loss against Ohio State in 1998, a season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten Conference title.[48] Brady capped that season with a 45\u201331 win over Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl.[49]\nIn the 1999 season, Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two players platooned during the season's first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The 1999 Michigan Wolverines started off with a 5\u20130 record, including a 26\u201322 win over Notre Dame, and a road win against eventual powerhouse Wisconsin. Against Michigan State, Brady was not chosen to play the second half; however, he was reinserted into the game with Michigan down by 17 points, and he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 34\u201331.[50] After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. Brady went on to lead Michigan to multiple 4th-quarter comebacks, including a remarkable 31\u201327 win against Penn State, and leading them out of a close game against Indiana, 34\u201331, heading into the regular season's final game, winners of three straight, earning him the moniker of \"Comeback Kid\".[51]\nMichigan concluded the regular season against Ohio State; this was a dramatic game with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied 17\u201317, Brady led Michigan to the winning score.[52] He led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards, four touchdowns, leading the team back from a pair of 14-point deficits in regulation (14\u20130 in the first half, and 28\u201314 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed an extra point following its own touchdown.[53][54]\nIn the two seasons that Brady started at Michigan, he posted a 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 record, including his two largest victories at the Citrus Bowl (1999) and the Orange Bowl (2000). Brady finished his career ranking third in Michigan history with 710 attempts and 442 completions, fourth with 5,351 yards and 62.3 completion percentage, and fifth with 35 touchdown passes.[29][55]\nA lightly regarded prospect coming out of college,[59][60] Brady was selected by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of 2000 NFL Draft and has since spent his entire 18-season career with the Patriots. Since Brady became their starting quarterback in 2001, the Patriots have never had a losing season and have won 14 division titles. The Patriots played in twelve AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2017\u2014including seven in a row from 2011 to 2017\u2014and won eight of them. Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have combined to form the most successful quarterback-head coach tandem in NFL history, winning more regular season games and postseason games than any other such duo[61] as well as appearing in eight Super Bowls. All of these events set new NFL records.[62]\nIn his second season, Brady took over as the starting quarterback after Drew Bledsoe was injured.[63] He led the Patriots to first place in the AFC East[64] and a victory over the favored St. Louis Rams[65][66] in Super Bowl XXXVI, winning his first Super Bowl MVP award. Despite the Patriots' missing the playoffs the following season, Brady would then lead them to back-to-back World Championships in 2003 and 2004, winning Super Bowl MVP honors again in 2003. Along the way, the Patriots won an NFL-record 21 consecutive games (including the playoffs) between the 2003 and 2004 seasons.[67] The 2005 season was Brady's first to throw for 4,000 yards and lead the NFL in passing.[68] That postseason, Brady would win his 10th consecutive playoff game, another NFL postseason record.[69]\nAlthough Brady and the Patriots continued to win often, they did not return to the Super Bowl until the 2007 season. That year, Brady not only set an NFL record with 50 touchdown passes[70] but he would also lead the Patriots to a 16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0 finish,[71] the first perfect regular-season record since the Miami Dolphins finished 14-0 in 1972.[72][73] Brady would win his first career NFL MVP Award, winning 49 out of 50 votes.[74] The Associated Press also named him Male Athlete of the Year, the first such award given to an NFL player since Joe Montana won it in 1989 and 1990.[75] However, the Patriots suffered their first Super Bowl loss with Brady as quarterback, dropping a 17-14 decision to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII.[76]\nBrady missed virtually the entire following season due to a knee injury in the season opener.[77] But he would come back strong in the 2009 season to be named the league's Comeback Player of the Year.[78] In 2010, Brady set the NFL record for consecutive passes without an interception (358)[79] and broke his own record for the highest season touchdown to interception ratio (among players who have started a full season) at 9:1, currently the third best TD:INT ratio for a single season by a quarterback.[80] Brady would win his second league MVP award with all 50 votes in his favor.[81] He was the first unanimous NFL MVP since Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor won the award in 1986.[82] He and Joe Montana are the only players in NFL history to win multiple NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.[83][84] Brady was also named the top player by his peers in the first NFL Top 100 list, released in 2011.[85]\nIn the 2011 season, Brady led the Patriots to their first AFC Championship since 2007 and appeared in the Super Bowl for a fifth time; but the Patriots would lose again to the Giants.[86] Following AFC Championship Game losses in the following seasons (2012 and 2013), Brady and the Patriots made their sixth trip to the Super Bowl after the 2014 season (Brady's 15th as a professional). There, he led the Patriots to a fourth-quarter comeback[87] over the defending champion Seattle Seahawks. He would lift his fourth Super Bowl trophy (the Patriots' first in ten seasons) and was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time.[88]\nDespite missing the first four games of the 2016 season, Brady would lead the Patriots (3-1 before he rejoined them)[89] to win 11 out of the 12 remaining regular season games and two postseason games to make his seventh and most recent Super Bowl appearance. Brady and the Patriots would overcome a 25-point deficit against the Atlanta Falcons (down 28-3 in the third quarter) to force the first overtime in Super Bowl history, winning 34-28 to give Brady his fifth Super Bowl title.[90] He earned his fourth Super Bowl MVP award after setting title-game records for appearances, pass attempts, completions, passing yards and fourth-quarter comebacks.[91] In 2018, Brady threw for 505 yards at 40 years old, setting a record for most passing yards in a Super Bowl, but the Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, denying Brady his sixth Super Bowl ring. Notably, Brady has shaken the hand of the losing quarterback after all five of his wins but has beaten a hasty retreat to the locker room to avoid shaking the hand of his opponent in all three of his losses.[92]\nOver his career, Brady has won three league MVP awards, five Super Bowls, and four Super Bowl MVP Awards. A 13-time Pro Bowler, Brady has also twice led the NFL in passing yardage[93][94]. As of November 2017, he currently owns the third-highest career passer rating (97.9) among quarterbacks with at least 1,500 career passing attempts.[95] He has thrown for more passing yards and touchdowns than any quarterback in NFL postseason history; he also has won more playoff games than any other quarterback. As a result of his highly successful career, Brady is rated among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[96]\nBrady was selected with pick #199, a compensatory pick, in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.[97] He and his family had believed that Brady would be drafted in the second or third round; they watched the draft on television, stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before him. Brady was so embarrassed that he briefly left the family home during the sixth round, and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. When the Patriots notified him that he would be drafted Brady was grateful that, he later said, he would not \"have to be an insurance salesman\".[98] According to Michael Holley's book Patriot Reign, the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay, both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein.[99] Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his subsequent success, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time.[100][101][102][103]\nBrady started the season as the fourth string quarterback, behind starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop; by season's end, he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe.[104] During his rookie season, he was 1-of-3 passing, for six yards.[105] Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Brady's first and only completed pass of the season in a 34\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9 loss to the Detroit Lions on November 23.[106][107]\nWith Bledsoe as the starting quarterback, the Patriots opened the season with a 23\u201317 loss at Cincinnati.[105] In their second game and home opener on September 23, the Patriots squared off against their AFC East rivals, the New York Jets. Bledsoe was again the starter; in the fourth quarter, he suffered internal bleeding after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Bledsoe returned for the next series, but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots' final series of the game. New York would hold on to win, 10\u20133, and the Patriots fell to 0\u20132 on the season.[108] Brady was named the starter for the season's third game, against the Indianapolis Colts. In his first two games as starter, Brady posted unspectacular passer ratings of 79.6 and 58.7, respectively, in a 44\u201313 victory over the Colts (in their last season in the AFC East) and a 30\u201310 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[109][110][111]\nIn the Patriots' fifth game, Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 26\u201316 in the fourth quarter, he led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force overtime, and another in overtime to set up a winning field goal. Brady finished the game with 33 pass completions on 54 attempts, for 364 yards, and two touchdowns and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career.[112][113] The following week, Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 38\u201317 win.[114] The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady started, and six straight to finish the regular season, winning the AFC East and entering the 2001\u201302 NFL playoffs with a first-round bye.[115] In that stretch was a Week 11 34\u201317 victory over the New Orleans Saints where he was 19 of 26 for 258 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod in 2001.[116] Brady finished the 2001 season with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns and earned an invitation to the 2002 Pro Bowl.[105][117]\nIn Brady's first playoff game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal. A controversial play occurred in that game. Trailing by three points in the fourth quarter, Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders' cornerback Charles Woodson. Oakland initially recovered the ball, but, citing the \"tuck rule,\" which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body, referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay, ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble.[118]\nIn the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brady injured his knee, and was relieved by Bledsoe.[119] The Patriots won the game by a score of 24\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17 and were immediately instituted by Las Vegas oddsmakers as 14-point underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI.[120][121]\nBrady returned from his knee injury in the AFC Championship Game to start in Super Bowl XXXVI a week later in New Orleans. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Patriots played well, holding the Rams' high powered offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 17\u20133 deficit to tie the game with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden said he thought the Patriots should run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime.[122] Instead, Brady drove the Patriots' offense down the field to the Rams' 31-yard line before spiking the ball with seven seconds left. Then kicker Adam Vinatieri converted a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20\u201317 win and their first ever league championship. Brady was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXVI while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. At the age of 24 years and six months, Brady surpassed Joe Namath in Super Bowl III and Joe Montana in Super Bowl XVI, who were both 25 years, seven months, and 13 days old at the time of their victories, to earn the title of youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[123][124] A possible quarterback controversy was averted when Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills during the offseason; this event cemented Brady's status as the starting quarterback.[125]\nIn the 2002 season opener, Brady had 294 passing yards and three touchdowns in the 30\u201314 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers to earn his third AFC Offensive of the Week title.[126][127] In Week 9, in a 38\u20137 victory over the Buffalo Bills, he had 265 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod.[128][129] Brady and the Patriots finished the year at 9\u20137, tied with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins for the best record in the division; however, the Jets won the division on the third tiebreaker, and the Patriots missed the playoffs.[130]\nThough Brady posted a career-low single-season passer rating of 85.7 and a career-high of 14 interceptions, he threw for a league-leading 28 touchdown passes and 921 more yards than in the 2001 season.[109] However, Brady played much of the second half of the season with a shoulder injury, and New England head coach Bill Belichick later indicated that Brady would not have been able to play in their first playoff game if the Patriots had made the playoffs.\nAfter opening the 2003 NFL season with a 2\u20132 start, Brady led the Patriots to twelve consecutive victories to finish the regular season in winning the AFC East.[131] In Week 9, against the Denver Broncos, he had 350 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 30\u201326 victory to earn his fifth AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[132][133] Statistically, Brady's strongest game of the season was in Week 17 against the division rival Buffalo Bills, when he achieved a season-high quarterback rating of 122.9, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[109][134] Brady finished with 3,620 passing yards and 23 touchdowns,[105] and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners Peyton Manning and Steve McNair.[135]\nIn the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans and Indianapolis Colts.[136][137] On February 1, 2004, Brady led the Patriots to a 32\u201329 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. During the game, Brady threw for 354 yards with three touchdowns and set the record for most completions by a quarterback in a Super Bowl with 32. With 1:08 left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 29\u201329, Brady engineered a drive to put the Patriots in position for the game-winning 41-yard field goal by Vinatieri.[138][139]\nDuring the 2004 season, Brady helped the Patriots set an NFL record with 21 straight wins dating from the previous year, an accomplishment honored in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (though for official records, the NFL considers it an 18-game regular season winning streak; it does not count playoff games).[140] New England finished with a 14\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 record, equaling their 2003 record and the best regular-season record ever for a defending champion.[141] The Patriots also won the AFC East divisional title for the third time in four years.[142] Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and was voted to his second Pro Bowl.[105]\nIn the AFC playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to victories over the Indianapolis Colts and the Pittsburgh Steelers.[143] Brady played his best game of the year in Pittsburgh despite requiring intravenous treatment the previous night when he ran a temperature of 103\u00b0.[144] Against the NFL's best defense,[143] he recorded a quarterback passer rating of 130.5, his highest of the season.[109] On February 6, 2005, the Patriots narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 24\u201321, to win Super Bowl XXXIX. Brady threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns[145] while capturing the Patriots' third championship in four years.\nDuring the 2005 season, injuries suffered by running backs Corey Dillon, Patrick Pass, and Kevin Faulk forced the Patriots to rely more on Brady's passing.[146][147] Brady also had to adjust to new center Russ Hochstein and running back Heath Evans. On October 9, in a 31\u201328 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, he had 350 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[148][149] Brady finished first in the league with 4,110 passing yards and third in the league with 26 touchdowns.[105] At 92.3, his 2005 passer rating was the second-highest of his career at the time, although he equaled his career high for interceptions with 14.[109] He rushed for 89 yards and fumbled a career-low four times.[109] He and the Patriots finished with a 10\u20136 record, winning their third straight AFC East title.[150] He was named to his third Pro Bowl at the end of the season.[151]\nIn the playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to a 28\u20133 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round; however, on January 14, 2006, the Patriots lost 27\u201313 to the Denver Broncos at INVESCO Field.[152][153] Brady threw for 341 yards in the game with one touchdown and two interceptions, in the first playoff loss of his career after ten playoff victories.[154] After the season's end, it was revealed that Brady had been playing with a sports hernia since December. Linebacker Willie McGinest commented on it and said he knew, but Brady continued playing.[155]\nBrady led the Patriots to a 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 record and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs.[156] In the regular season, Brady threw for 3,529 yards and 24 touchdowns.[105] He was not among the players initially selected to the Pro Bowl,[157] although he was offered an injury-replacement selection when San Diego Chargers Philip Rivers was forced to withdraw (which he declined).[158]\nIn the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their division rivals, the New York Jets, in the Wild Card Round. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37\u201316, as Brady went 22\u201334 for 212 yards and two touchdowns.[159] In the Divisional Round, the Patriots traveled to San Diego to take on the Chargers. This was Brady's first playoff game in his home state of California. Brady and the Patriots struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI.[160] With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down by eight points, Brady and the Patriots started a key drive that would ultimately decide the game. After a 49-yard pass play to wide receiver Reche Caldwell, a Stephen Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 24\u201321 win.[161]\nIn the AFC Championship, the Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots and Colts had faced each other twice in the previous three postseasons at Foxborough; this game, however, was played at Indianapolis. The Patriots led at halftime, 21\u20136; however, the Colts and Peyton Manning staged a comeback, culminating in a last minute interception thrown by Brady, and the Patriots lost the game to the Colts, 34\u201338.[162]\nPlaying with a dramatically overhauled receiver corps\u2014in the 2007 offseason, the Patriots acquired wide receivers Dont\u00e9 Stallworth, Wes Welker, Kelley Washington, and Randy Moss; tight end Kyle Brady; and running back Sammy Morris\u2014Brady enjoyed what some sportswriters described as one of the best seasons by a quarterback.[163][164] The average score of a 2007 Patriots regular-season game would be 37\u201317 by the end of the year.[165] Brady led the Patriots to the first 16\u20130 regular-season record in league history, outscoring opponents by more than a 2-to-1 margin, but also attained numerous career, franchise, and NFL records and milestones in the process. He was named as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week five separate times that year.[166][167][168][169][170] While away at Dallas, he had a career-high five passing touchdowns in a 48\u201327 win. The win tied him with Cowboys Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach for the most wins ever by a starting quarterback in his first 100 regular-season games, with 76.[171] The next week, in part of a 49\u201328 win at Miami, he had yet another record day, with six passing touchdowns, setting a franchise record. He also had the first perfect passer rating of his career.[172] Two weeks later, as part of a come-from-behind 24\u201320 victory at Indianapolis, he threw for another three touchdowns, the ninth consecutive game in which he had done so, breaking Peyton Manning's NFL record of eight.[173] During the last game of the year, Brady threw two touchdown passes; his second touchdown was his 50th, breaking Peyton Manning's 2004 record of 49.[174]\nBrady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, and only eight interceptions. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns in a season and his 117.2 passer rating is[when?] the fourth highest in a single season. His 8.7% touchdown passing percentage is[when?] the third highest ever in a season. He led the Patriots to becoming the first team to ever go undefeated in the regular season since the 16 game schedule was enforced and directed an offense that scored a then NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. Those records stood until they were eclipsed by the 2013 Denver Broncos. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the Most Valuable Player of this season, as well as Offensive Player of the Year. He was also honored by the Associated Press as their Male Athlete of the Year, the first time an NFL player has been so honored since Joe Montana won the award in 1990.[175] He was named as a First Team All-Pro and to his fourth career Pro Bowl as a result of his historic season.[176][177]\nIn the Patriots' first playoff game, an AFC Divisional Round game against Jacksonville, Brady began the game with an NFL postseason record 16 consecutive completed passes, and finished the game with 26 completions in 28 attempts, a completion rate of 92.9%. That mark is the highest single-game completion percentage (for passers with at least 20 attempts) in NFL history, regular season or postseason.[178] With the win, the Patriots matched the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only team to win 17 consecutive games in one season.\nStatistically, Brady did not fare as well in the AFC Championship Game against the San Diego Chargers, throwing three interceptions (including his first interception in the red zone since the playoff loss to Denver in the 2005 postseason). Nevertheless, the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21\u201312, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback to do so: his 100\u201326 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana's.[179] In Super Bowl XLII, Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times. The Patriots did manage to take the lead with a Brady touchdown to Moss with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Giants were able to score a last-minute touchdown to upset the Patriots 17\u201314, taking away what would have been the first perfect season since the NFL expanded its regular season to 16 games.[180]\nBrady did not play in any games during the 2008 preseason or in the 2008 Pro Bowl due to two different foot injuries.[181][182] In the Patriots' 2008 season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium, Brady's left knee was seriously injured midway through the first quarter on a hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard; he left the game and did not return. The team later confirmed that Brady would require surgery, and it would prematurely end his 2008 season.[183] Brady tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament.[184] The injury ended Brady's streak of 111 consecutive starts (seventh in the list of most consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, behind Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Ron Jaworski, and Joe Flacco).[185] Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the Los Angeles Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic October 6, using Brady's patellar tendon graft to replace the torn ligament, and also repaired his medial collateral ligament, through a separate incision in his left knee.[186] An infection in the wound resulted in further debridement surgery several times since the original procedure. Brady received IV antibiotics for this infection which, at the time, threatened to delay his rehab.[187][188] Despite Brady's absence, the Patriots managed to finish the 2008 season with an 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 record; however, due to tiebreakers, the Patriots not only failed to win the AFC East division title, but missed the playoffs altogether for the first time since the 2002 season.[189]\nIn his first game in nearly a year, Brady threw for 378 yards and two touchdowns in the 2009 season opener against the Buffalo Bills. In the final minutes of the game, the Patriots were down 24\u201313 before Brady and tight end Benjamin Watson connected on two straight touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 25\u201324 win.[190] Brady was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 13th time in his career for his performance.[191]\nOn October 18, 2009, in an early season snowstorm, Brady set an NFL record against the Tennessee Titans for most touchdowns in a single quarter, throwing five in the second quarter. Brady finished the game with six touchdowns, tying his career best, and 380 yards, completing 29-of-34 attempts, finishing with a nearly perfect passer rating of 152.8.[192][193] He earned his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod for his efforts against the Titans.[194] The Patriots' 59\u20130 victory over the Titans tied the record for the largest margin of victory since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger,[195] and set a record for largest halftime lead in NFL history, which was 45\u20130.\nBrady finished the 2009 regular season with 4,398 yards passing and 28 touchdowns for a 96.2 rating,[105] despite a broken right ring finger and three fractured ribs, all which were suffered over the course of the season.[196] He was selected as a reserve to the 2010 Pro Bowl and named the 2009 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.[197][198]\nBrady ended the 2009 season throwing for 154 passing yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in a Wild Card Round loss to the Baltimore Ravens, 33\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14, his first career home playoff loss, and the first playoff loss at home by a Patriots quarterback since 1978 (Steve Grogan).[199]\nOn September 10, 2010, Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract extension, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The extension included $48.5 million in guaranteed money.[200]\nBrady became the quickest quarterback to achieve 100 regular season wins by helping his team defeat the Miami Dolphins 41\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 on October 4, 2010.[201]\nIn a 31\u201328 win over the Indianapolis Colts on November 21, 2010, Brady tied Brett Favre's record of winning 25 consecutive regular-season home starts.[202] Brady's last regular-season defeat at home was a 17\u201314 loss to the New York Jets on November 12, 2006.[203] On November 25, in a 45\u201324 victory over the Detroit Lions, he had 341 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[204][205] The next week, in a 45\u20133 victory over the New York Jets, he had 326 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second consecutive week. The victory over the Jets set an NFL record by winning 26 consecutive regular-season home starts.[206][207][208]\nBrady threw for 3,900 yards with 36 touchdowns and only four interceptions on the season.[105] He had a 111.0 passer rating; this gave him\u2014at the time\u2014two of the top five season ratings in NFL history and made him the first player to finish with a rating above 110 in two different seasons.[209]\nBrady was selected as a starter to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[210] However, he pulled out of the game (and was replaced by former backup Matt Cassel of the Kansas City Chiefs) after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot dating back to 2008.[211] Brady was also the only unanimous selection for the AP All-Pro Team and was named the 2010 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year. By unanimous decision, he won the MVP award for the second time in his career.[212] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011 players' list, Brady was ranked as the best player in the NFL by his fellow players.[213]\nAfter earning the #1 seed and a bye week, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets in the Divisional Round by a score of 28\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21. Brady finished the game 29-of-45 for 299 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His one interception ended his NFL record of consecutive passes without an interception at 340.[214][215]\nIn Week 1 of the 2011 NFL season, Brady threw for 517 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in a 38\u201324 victory over the Miami Dolphins and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[216] This was the second time that he had thrown for 400 or more yards in a single game. In the game, he threw a record-tying 99-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker in the second quarter.[217][218][219] In the next game, a 35\u201321 victory over the San Diego Chargers, he had 423 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod.[220][221]\nIn Week 16, in the second divisional game against the Miami Dolphins, Brady had 304 passing yards and one passing touchdown to go along with nine rushes for 17 yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 27\u201324 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in 2011.[222][223] In the regular season finale against the Buffalo Bills, Brady became the fourth quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards in a single season, finishing with 5,235; although Brady surpassed Dan Marino's longstanding record of 5,084 passing yards, he finished the season second in passing yards behind Drew Brees's 5,476.[105] In the end, the Patriots finished the season 13\u20133 and clinched the AFC's #1 seed.[224] For his efforts in the 2011 season, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl and was named as the fourth best player in the NFL on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012 by his peers.[225][226]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201cBill Belichick\nIn the Patriots' 45\u201310 rout of the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, Brady set a personal postseason best with 363 passing yards, and tied an NFL playoff record shared by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young, throwing for six touchdown passes.[228] The win, his first postseason win since January 2008, gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick sole possession of the NFL record for postseason wins by a quarterback-head coach combo with 15.[229] In the AFC Championship game against the Baltimore Ravens, Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 36 games, though he did pass for 239 yards and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown late in the game. A missed field goal from Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff gave Brady and the Patriots a 23-20 victory, sending the Patriots to the Super Bowl for the fifth time since Brady joined the team.[230] In Super Bowl XLVI, Brady and the Patriots met the New York Giants in a rematch of their Super Bowl XLII meeting four years earlier. Brady played well, leading a Super Bowl record-tying 96-yard touchdown drive to close the first half and at one point completing 16 passes in a row to give him a 20-of-23 mark partway into the third quarter, another Super Bowl record. Brady threw two touchdowns against one interception, and was penalized for intentional grounding in the end zone, giving up a crucial safety to the Giants. A final score of 21\u201317 for the Giants prevented Brady from winning his fourth Super Bowl.[231]\nBrady started all 16 regular season games of the 2012 NFL season and led the Patriots to a 12\u20134 record. Among the many highlights of the team was a 42\u201314 win over the Houston Texans in Week 14. Brady had 296 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[232][233] The Patriots scored 557 total points, the third highest in league history and Brady became the first quarterback to lead his team to ten division titles.[234] With that point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads, which was a record as well. He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, only eight interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7. It was Brady's third straight season throwing for over 30 touchdowns.[235] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth time in his career.[236] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013, Brady was ranked fourth by his fellow players for the second consecutive time.[237]\nBrady started both Patriots playoff games, winning 41\u201328 against the Houston Texans.[238] With the victory, Brady surpassed Joe Montana for most career playoff wins, with 17. The Patriots were then upset by the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens, 28\u201313 in the AFC Championship.[239]\nOn February 25, 2013, Brady and the Patriots agreed on a three-year contract extension, which kept him with the team through 2017.[240] Peter King called it an \"amazing\" deal, as Brady took just $27 million in new money over the 2015, 2016, and 2017 seasons, and also noted that it reflected Patriots owner Robert Kraft's desire to make sure that Brady retired as a Patriot.[241]\nBrady and the Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball. Tight end Rob Gronkowski was injured and Aaron Hernandez was arrested. Wes Welker departed to the Denver Broncos, Danny Woodhead left in free agency for the San Diego Chargers, and Brandon Lloyd was released from the team. In order to replace the five players, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency from the Rams, drafted rookie wide receivers Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins. In the first two games of the season, Brady completed 52% of his passes and had three touchdowns and one interception.[242][243]\nBrady was in pursuit of Drew Brees's record of at least one touchdown in 54 consecutive regular season games and saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week 5 loss against the Cincinnati Bengals.[244] In a Week 6 game against the Saints, the Patriots struggled in the first half and bounced back in the second with Brady passing for 269 yards with a touchdown to Kenbrell Thompkins as time expired to pull out the win over the Saints.[245]\nIn Week 12, Brady faced-off against Peyton Manning for the fourteenth time in his career. After going to the half trailing by 24 points, Brady and the Patriots scored 31 unanswered points. The Patriots won after a muffed punt in overtime when Stephen Gostkowski scored a field goal.[246] With the win, Brady earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[247] With a Week 16 win over the Baltimore Ravens, Brady collected his 147th win as a starting quarterback to tie Dan Marino for fourth place all time, and the following week he defeated the Buffalo Bills to tie John Elway for third place. Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in career and was ranked third on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014 players' list in the offseason.[248][249]\nBrady's Patriots finished the season 12\u20134, to earn the second seed in the AFC and a first-round bye.[250] In the Divisional Round matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, Brady made his 25th playoff appearance, breaking Brett Favre's career record for playoff appearances by a quarterback (Jerry Rice appeared in 29 playoff games). He passed for 198 yards as the Patriots won 43\u201322 behind a four-touchdown performance from LeGarrette Blount.[251] The following week, the Patriots lost 26\u201316 to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship, eliminating Brady and the Patriots from the playoffs.[252]\nBrady started the 2014 season with a 33\u201320 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[253] It was Brady's first opening day loss since the 2003 season. Brady recorded 241 yards and a touchdown in the loss. New England rebounded against the Minnesota Vikings, but Brady struggled, throwing for 149 yards and a touchdown in a 30\u20137 win.[254] Against the Oakland Raiders, Brady was pressured all day, but threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in 16\u20139 win.[255] After a humiliating 41\u201314 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Brady led New England to back-to-back wins against the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills.[256][257] Brady then defeated the New York Jets with a 261-yard performance that included three touchdowns.[258] The following week, a 51\u201323 embarrassment of the Chicago Bears saw Brady throw for 354 yards and a season-high five touchdowns.[259] After passing for 333 yards, and 257 yards in his next two games against the Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts respectively, Brady defeated the Detroit Lions 34\u20139 with 349 passing yards and two touchdowns against only one interception.[260] The Patriots winning streak was put to the test against the Green Bay Packers in Week 13. Down 13\u20130 early, Brady threw for 245 yards and two touchdowns. Still down 26\u201321, Brady was unable to give the Patriots their eighth consecutive victory.[261] After trailing 14\u20133 at the San Diego Chargers, Brady rallied his team with 317 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, to a 23\u201314 comeback win.[262] Brady clinched his NFL record 12th AFC East division title with 287 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Brady struggled in his final two games, throwing for only 182 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in 17\u201316 victory against the Jets, and 80 yards in one half of the final regular season game against the Buffalo Bills, a 17\u20139 loss, though Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and three starting offensive linemen did not play either the entirety or the majority of the final game, and Brady only played in the first half.[263] Brady was named to his tenth career Pro Bowl and was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[264][265]\nIn a 35\u201331 Divisional Round win over the Ravens, Brady threw for three touchdowns and ran in a fourth, breaking Curtis Martin's club record for rushing touchdowns in the playoffs; Brady also broke Joe Montana's record for playoff touchdowns with 46. After the Ravens scored on their first two possessions, the Patriots were quickly down 14\u20130. Brady led New England on an eight-play, 78-yard drive, and ran for a score to cut the Ravens lead to 14\u20137. In the second quarter, Brady's 15 yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola tied the score at 14\u201314. After getting the ball back, Brady threw an interception at the end of the first half. Joe Flacco capitalized on it by throwing an 11-yard touchdown strike to tight end Owen Daniels to give Baltimore a 21\u201314 halftime lead. Down 28\u201314, Brady engineered an 80-yard drive, culminating in a touchdown to Rob Gronkowski to cut the lead to 28\u201321. The Patriots tied the game once again at 28 off of a trick play where Brady passed laterally to Julian Edelman who then threw a 51-yard touchdown to Danny Amendola. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker drilled a 25-yard field goal to give Baltimore a 31\u201328 4th quarter lead. Brady got the ball back, and threw a 23-yard touchdown to wide receiver Brandon LaFell to give the Patriots their first lead, up 35\u201331. After a Duron Harmon interception and a Joe Flacco Hail Mary attempt failed, Brady clinched his record ninth AFC Championship Game, fourth straight, and the third championship game against the Indianapolis Colts.[266] After a 45\u20137 blowout, Brady advanced to play in his sixth Super Bowl, breaking a tie with John Elway for most career Super Bowl appearances by a quarterback.[267]\nIn Super Bowl XLIX, Brady completed 37-of-50 passes for 328 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. He guided a then-record ten-point fourth quarter comeback as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24 to give Brady his fourth Super Bowl ring, tying him with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for most Super Bowl victories by a starting quarterback.[268] He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana's record. Brady's 37 completed passes in the game set a Super Bowl record at the time, which Brady himself would break in Super Bowl LI two years later.[269]\nOn May 6, 2015, the NFL published a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs used in the previous season's AFC Championship Game.[270] The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on \"substantial and credible evidence\" that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed to cooperate with the investigators.[271] On May 11, Troy Vincent\u2014NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations\u2014penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: \"Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football.\"[272] Vincent's letter further stated: \"With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence.\"[272] Brady, through the NFL Players Association, officially appealed the suspension on May 14.[273]\nOn July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the upholding of Brady's four game suspension.[274] Brady gave permission to the NFLPA to appeal the suspension in federal court.[275] Goodell cited Brady's destruction of his cell phone as a critical factor in his decision to uphold Brady's suspension.[276][277] The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell's decision.[278] On July 29 Brady released a statement on his Facebook page that criticized Goodell's decision to uphold the suspension, saying in part \"I am very disappointed by the NFL's decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against me. I did nothing wrong, and no one in the Patriots organization did either... I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight.\"[279][280]\nCommentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report writer Mike Freeman made a statement agreeing with Goodell's decision, saying the penalties were \"brutal, but it deserved to be.\"[281] Various commentators also implied that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment.[281][282] Others described the punishment as \"firm but fair\".[283]\nOn September 3, 2015, Judge Richard M. Berman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated Brady's suspension; this ruling allowed Brady to play in the first four games of the 2015 NFL season. In his decision, Judge Berman cited the NFL's failure to provide proper notice to Brady of the charges against him and the potential for a suspension.[284] Post-appeal commentary also criticized Goodell for \"manipulating Brady's testimony\" at the appeal hearing in his decision.[285]\nIn the NFL Kickoff Game, Brady led the Patriots to a 28\u201321 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He threw for 288 yards and four touchdowns, three of them to Rob Gronkowski.[286] The Patriots' victory was the 161st victory of Brady's career, all with the Patriots, which surpassed the record held by former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for most regular season wins by a starting quarterback with a single team. In Week 2, Brady followed up his Week 1 performance by throwing for 466 yards and three touchdowns against the Buffalo Bills. Through the first five games of the season, Brady threw a total of 14 touchdowns with one interception and had a quarterback rating of 118.4.[287] In Week 8, a 36\u20137 victory over the Miami Dolphins, he had 356 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his 25th AFC Offensive Player of the Week title.[288][289]\nDespite Brady's success, the Patriots were hit by many injuries to key players on offense, including wide receiver Julian Edelman, and the Patriots eventually lost their first game against the Broncos, who were without Peyton Manning, in Denver on the Sunday after Thanksgiving following a 10\u20130 start.[290] The Patriots then lost three of their remaining five games to finish 12\u20134 for a fourth straight season, tied with the Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos for the AFC's best record. Denver clinched the No. 1 seed due to their victories over both the Patriots and the Bengals, while the Patriots finished with the AFC's No. 2 seed due to having a better record against common opponents than Cincinnati.[291][292] Brady finished the regular season with a league-leading 36 touchdown passes and seven interceptions.[293] He was named to his 11th Pro Bowl (seventh straight), and was ranked as the second best player on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 behind only league MVP Cam Newton.[294][295]\nWith the return of Julian Edelman from a foot injury, the Patriots defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round by a score of 27\u201320 after advancing with a first round bye.[296] The Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium to face Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. It would turn out to be the 17th and final meeting between the two storied quarterbacks, as Manning would announce his retirement after the season ended. The Broncos' top-ranked defense harassed Brady, who completed 27-of-56 passes with two interceptions and a touchdown, all day, and the Patriots eventually lost the game 20\u201318 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion attempt failed with 17 seconds left in regulation.[297]\nOn February 29, 2016, Brady signed a two-year contract extension covering the 2018 and 2019 seasons.[298]\nThree days later, the NFL appealed Judge Richard M. Berman's 2015 decision to vacate Brady's four-game suspension as punishment for his alleged role in the Deflategate scandal. At the March 3, 2016, hearing in New York City, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit questioned Players Association lawyer Jeffrey L. Kessler more intensely than NFL lawyer Paul Clement, with Circuit Judge Denny Chin even stating that \"the evidence of ball tampering is compelling, if not overwhelming.\"[299]\nOn April 25, 2016, Judge Richard M. Berman's decision to block Brady's four-game suspension was overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court.[300][301] Circuit Judge Barrington Daniels Parker Jr., joined by Circuit Judge Chin, wrote that they could not \"second-guess\" the arbitration but were merely determining it \"met the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947\".[302] Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann dissented, writing that the NFL's fines for using stickum was \"highly analogous\" and that here \"the Commissioner was doling out his own brand of industrial justice.\"[303]\nOn May 23, 2016, Brady appealed for his case to be reheard by the full U.S. 2nd Circuit Court.[304] The 2nd Circuit Court denied Brady's request for an en banc hearing on July 13.[305] Two days later, on Friday, July 15, 2016, Brady announced on his Facebook page that he would give up his Deflategate fight and accept his suspension for the first four regular season games of the 2016 season. Prior to Brady's suspension, he had not missed a single regular season or postseason game since the start of the 2009 season.\nAfter serving his four-game suspension, Brady made his 2016 season debut on October 9 on the road against the Cleveland Browns; he completed 28-of-40 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns in a 33\u201313 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[306][307] In his home debut the following week, Brady completed 29-of-35 passes for 376 yards and three touchdowns in a 35\u201317 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.[308] In Week 7, Brady completed 19 of 26 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns as New England defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27\u201316.[309] The next week, the Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills 41\u201325, with Brady completing 22-of-33 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns.[310] Brady's outstanding numbers during his first four games following the suspension earned him the AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for October.[311]\nFollowing a bye week, Brady and the Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks in a Week 10 rematch of Super Bowl XLIX. Brady completed 23-of-32 passes for 316 yards, one interception, and no touchdowns in a 31\u201324 loss that saw the two teams trade leads seven times.[312] In Week 11, Brady completed 24-of-40 passes for 280 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 30\u201317 road win against his childhood team, the San Francisco 49ers. Brady's performance against San Francisco earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for Week 11.[313] Those four touchdown passes also gave him 444 career regular season touchdown passes with one team, breaking Brett Favre's record. The following week, Brady completed 30-of-50 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns in a 22\u201317 road victory against the New York Jets.[314] The win was also the Patriots' 500th victory (including playoffs) in franchise history. During this victory, Brady also became the fifth quarterback to record 60,000 career regular season passing yards, joining Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, and Dan Marino. The following week, Brady completed 33-of-46 passes for 269 yards and one touchdown as the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 26\u201310.[315] The Patriots' win against the Rams gave Brady his 201st career victory, including playoff games, breaking Peyton Manning's record of 200.[316] In Week 14, Brady completed 25 of 38 passes for 406 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception during a 30\u201323 victory against the Baltimore Ravens on Monday Night Football.[317]\nThe next week, Brady completed 16-of-32 passes for 188 yards in a 16\u20133 victory in Denver.[318] With this victory, the Patriots clinched an eighth consecutive AFC East title and a seventh consecutive first-round bye in the playoffs, both NFL records.[319] On December 20, 2016, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth straight season and 12th time overall.[320][321] In Week 16, Brady threw for 17 of 27 passes for 214 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions as he led the Patriots to a 41\u20133 win over the Jets.[322] In Week 17, Brady completed 25-of-33 passes for 276 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 35\u201314 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the regular season finale that gave the Patriots home field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.[323] Brady's 276 yards against Miami moved him ahead of former Miami quarterback Dan Marino into fourth place on the NFL's all-time passing yards list. Brady's three touchdowns against Miami also gave him 28 passing touchdowns against two interceptions for the regular season. This broke the previous record of Nick Foles's 27:2 TD:INT ratio which was set in 2013 with the Philadelphia Eagles.[324] Brady was named to the AP All-Pro Second Team, behind Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons, who was named to the AP All-Pro First Team.[325] Brady was also was ranked first on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 as the best player in the league, becoming the first player to be named as #1 twice since the listing started.[326]\nBrady and the Patriots began their postseason run in the Divisional Round, hosting the Houston Texans, who had the league's No. 1 total defense. Brady completed 18-of-38 passes for 287 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Patriots won 34\u201316, clinching a record sixth consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game.[327] The Patriots then defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 36\u201317. Against the Steelers, Brady completed 32-of-42 passes for 384 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick their record seventh conference title as a quarterback\u2013head coach tandem, and the Patriots an NFL record ninth Super Bowl appearance.[328]\nBrady and the Patriots faced the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons\u2014who boasted the league's highest scoring offense\u2014in Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on Sunday, February 5, 2017. Brady threw for 43 completions on 62 attempts for 466 passing yards\u2014all Super Bowl records at the time. Brady also threw for two touchdowns and an interception. After trailing 28\u20133 midway through the third quarter, Brady and the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game at the end of regulation. This resulted in the first overtime in Super Bowl history. After winning the overtime coin toss, Brady marched the Patriots down the field to score a touchdown and win the game by a score of 34\u201328,[329] completing the largest comeback win in both team history and Super Bowl history. With the victory, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl, which set a record for most Super Bowl victories of any quarterback in history and tied defensive player Charles Haley for the most Super Bowl victories for any player. In addition, Brady set another record by winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award for his clutch performance.[330]\nAfter the game, it was discovered that Brady's jersey had gone missing from the Patriots' locker room at NRG Stadium.[331] The FBI, in collaboration with Mexican authorities, recovered the jersey from the home of Martin Mauricio Ortega, a Mexican tabloid writer, along with Brady's jersey from Super Bowl XLIX.[332]\nOn May 12, 2017, Brady was announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 18.[333]\nIn a CBS interview on May 17, 2017, Charlie Rose asked Brady's wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, if she wanted Brady to retire, despite the fact that he was playing at a high level. B\u00fcndchen mentioned that Brady suffered from a concussion in the 2016 season, saying, \"I mean he has concussions pretty much every\u2014I mean we don't talk about\u2014but he does have concussions. I don't really think it's a healthy thing for anybody to go through.\u201d[334][335]\nFollowing the B\u00fcndchen interview, the NFL released a statement: \"We have reviewed all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants and certified athletic trainer spotters who worked at Patriots\u2019 home and away 2016 season games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league office. There are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms. Today we have been in contact with the NFLPA and will work together to gather more information from the club\u2019s medical staff and Mr. Brady\u201d.[336][337] Brady's agent, Don Yee, said that Brady was not diagnosed with a concussion during the 2016 season.[338]\nThe Patriots opened up their 2017 season in the NFL Kickoff Game on September 7 at home against the Kansas City Chiefs.

In the Patriots' next game, a narrow 19\u201314 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football, Brady completed 30 out of 40 passes for 303 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. With this victory, Brady became the third quarterback in NFL history to record 186 career regular season victories, tying Peyton Manning and Brett Favre for the most such wins of any quarterback in NFL history.[344] On October 10, it was unveiled that Brady was diagnosed with an AC joint sprain in his left (non-throwing) shoulder.[345][346] During Week 6 against the New York Jets, Brady threw for 257 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Patriots won 24\u201317.

        "text": "The Democratic Party is the oldest voter-based political party in the world and the oldest existing political party in the United States, tracing its heritage back to the anti-Federalists of the 1790s.[1][2][3] During the Second Party System (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under Presidents Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk, the Democrats usually bested the opposition Whig Party by narrow margins. Both parties worked hard to build grassroots organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent.[citation needed] Both parties used patronage extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city political machines as well as national networks of newspapers. The Democratic Party was a proponent for slave-owners across the country, urban workers and caucasian immigrants.[citation needed]\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the Civil War to the Great Depression, the opposing Republican Party, organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in presidential politics. The Democrats elected only two Presidents to four terms of office for 72 years: Grover Cleveland (in 1884 and 1892) and Woodrow Wilson (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in Congressional politics, enjoying House of Representatives majorities (as in the 65th Congress) in 15 of the 36 Congresses elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the Senate. The party was split between the Bourbon Democrats, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of \"free silver\" (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated the \"Great Commoner\" William Jennings Bryan in 1896, 1900 and 1908, though he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the Progressive Movement (1890s\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1920s).\nStarting with 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the Fifth Party System, with its liberal/progressive policies and programs with the New Deal coalition to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous Wall Street Crash of 1929 and later going into the crises leading up to the Second World War of 1939/1941 to 1945. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the White House and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third Vice President Harry S Truman, former Senator from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of 1944 and the \"stunner\" of 1948). A new Republican Party President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the Governor of Illinois Adlai Stevenson (grandson of the former Vice President with the same name of the 1890s) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower (in 1952 and 1956).\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the U.S. Senate for most of that same period, electing the Speaker of the House and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included Presidents: 33rd \u2013 Harry S Truman of Missouri (1945\u20131953) and 36th \u2013 Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas (1963\u20131969); as well as the earlier Kennedy brothers of 35th President John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts (1961\u20131963); Senators Robert F. Kennedy of New York and Senator Edward M. (\"Teddy\") Kennedy of Massachusetts who carried the flag for modern American political liberalism. Since the presidential election of 1976, Democrats have won five out of the last ten presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of 1976 (with 39th President Jimmy Carter of Georgia, 1977\u20131981), 1992 and 1996 (with 42nd President Bill Clinton of Arkansas, 1993\u20132001) and 2008 and 2012 (with 44th President Barack Obama of Illinois, 2009\u20132017).\nSocial scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".[4]\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the 1830s from former factions of the Democratic-Republican Party, which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by Martin Van Buren who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero Andrew Jackson of Tennessee.[5]\nThe spirit of Jacksonian democracy animated the party from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the Second Party System, with the Whig Party the main opposition. After the disappearance of the Federalists after 1815 and the Era of Good Feelings (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.[6]\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Norton explains:\nThe Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. ... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.[7]\nThe Party was weakest in New England, but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia (by far the most populous states at the time) and the American frontier. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the Bank of the United States and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the yeoman or independent small farmer.[8]\nHistorian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide:\nDemocrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.[9]\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern American Indians and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the war with Mexico and opposed anti-immigrant nativism. Both Democrats and Whigs were divided on the issue of slavery. In the 1830s, the Locofocos in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of hard money and free trade.[10][11] Their chief spokesman was William Leggett. At this time, labor unions were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.[12]\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s, as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported Manifest Destiny and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The 1844 election was a showdown, with the Democrat James K. Polk narrowly defeating Whig Henry Clay on the Texas issue.[13]\nJohn Mack Faragher's analysis of the political polarization between the parties is:\nMost Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. ... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.[14]\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) was created in 1848 at the convention that nominated General Lewis Cass, who lost to General Zachary Taylor of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new Free Soil Party, which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic Party, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor. Democrats in Congress passed the Compromise of 1850 designed to put the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and nativism. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats Franklin Pierce in 1852 and James Buchanan in 1856.[15]\nDuring 1858\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1860, Senator Stephen A. Douglas confronted President Buchanan in a furious battle for control of the party. Douglas finally won, but his nomination signaled defeat for the Southern wing of the party and it walked out of the 1860 convention and nominated its own presidential ticket.[16]\nYonatan Eyal (2007) argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of a new faction of young Democrats called \"Young America\". Led by Stephen A. Douglas, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier August Belmont, this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and strict constructionist orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including William Cullen Bryant, George Bancroft, Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne. They sought independence from European standards of high culture and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and exceptionalism of America's own literary tradition.[17]\nIn economic policy, Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure with railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes and harbors. They endorsed the \"market revolution\" and promoted capitalism. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that internal improvements were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of Jeffersonian democracy by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to free trade, while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue. They supported the Independent Treasury (the Jacksonian alternative to the Second Bank of the United States) not as a scheme to quash the special privilege of the Whiggish monied elite, but as a device to spread prosperity to all Americans.[18]\nSectional confrontations escalated during the 1850s, the Democratic Party split between North and South grew deeper. The conflict was papered over at the 1852 and 1856 conventions by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian Roy F. Nichols explains why Franklin Pierce was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\nIn 1854, over vehement opposition, the main Democratic leader in the Senate, Stephen Douglas of Illinois, pushed through the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. It established that settlers in Kansas Territory could vote to decide to allow or not allow slavery. Thousands of men moved in from North and South with the goal of voting slavery down or up and their violence shook the nation. A major re-alignment took place among voters and politicians, with new issues, new parties and new leaders. The Whig Party dissolved entirely.[20]\nThe crisis for the Democratic Party came in the late 1850s as Democrats increasingly rejected national policies demanded by the Southern Democrats. The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.[21]\nWhen the new Republican Party formed in 1854 on the basis of refusing to tolerate the expansion of slavery into the territories, many northern Democrats (especially Free Soilers from 1848) joined it. The Republicans in 1854 now had a majority in most, but not all of the Northern states and it had practically no support South of the Mason\u00e2\u20ac\u201cDixon line. The formation of the new short-lived Know-Nothing Party allowed the Democrats to win the presidential election of 1856.[20] Buchanan, a Northern \"Doughface\" (his base of support was in the pro-slavery South), split the party on the issue of slavery in Kansas when he attempted to pass a federal slave code as demanded by the South. Most Democrats in the North rallied to Senator Douglas, who preached \"Popular Sovereignty\" and believed that a Federal slave code would be undemocratic.[22]\nThe Democratic Party was unable to compete with the Republican Party, which controlled nearly all northern states by 1860, bringing a solid majority in the Electoral College. The Republicans claimed that the Northern Democrats, including Doughfaces such as Pierce and Buchanan, as well as advocates of popular sovereignty such as Stephen A. Douglas and Lewis Cass, were all accomplices to Slave Power. The Republicans argued that slaveholders (all of them Democrats) had seized control of the federal government and were blocking the progress of liberty.[23]\nIn 1860, the Democrats were unable to stop the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, even as they feared his election would lead to civil war. The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President Buchanan along Northern and Southern lines: factions of the party provided two separate candidacies for President in the election of 1860, in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy.[24]\nSome Southern Democratic delegates followed the lead of the Fire-Eaters by walking out of the Democratic National Convention at Charleston's Institute Hall in April 1860 and were later joined by those who, once again led by the Fire-Eaters, left the Baltimore Convention the following June when the convention rejected a resolution supporting extending slavery into territories whose voters did not want it. The Southern Democrats nominated the pro-slavery incumbent Vice President, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, for President and General Joseph Lane, former governor of Oregon, for Vice President.[25]\nThe Northern Democrats proceeded to nominate Douglas of Illinois for President and former Governor of Georgia Herschel Vespasian Johnson for Vice President, while some southern Democrats joined the Constitutional Union Party, backing its nominees (who had both been prominent Whig leaders), former Senator John Bell of Tennessee for President and the politician Edward Everett of Massachusetts for Vice President. This fracturing of the Democrats left them powerless. Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States. Douglas campaigned across the country calling for unity and came in second in the popular vote, but carried only Missouri and New Jersey. Breckinridge carried 11 slave states, coming in second in the Electoral vote, but third in the popular vote.[26]\nDuring the Civil War, Northern Democrats divided into two factions: the War Democrats, who supported the military policies of President Lincoln; and the Copperheads, who strongly opposed them. No party politics were allowed in the Confederacy, whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime. Consequently, the Democratic Party halted all operations during the life of the Confederacy (1861\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1865).[27]\nPartisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the attack on Fort Sumter, Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the Copperheads.[27] The Democratic Party did well in the 1862 congressional elections, but in 1864 it nominated General George McClellan (a War Democrat) on a peace platform and lost badly because many War Democrats bolted to National Union candidate Abraham Lincoln. Many former Democrats became Republicans, especially soldiers such as generals Ulysses S. Grant and John A. Logan.[28]\nIn the 1866 elections, the Radical Republicans won two-thirds majorities in Congress and took control of national affairs. The large Republican majorities made Congressional Democrats helpless, though they unanimously opposed the Radicals' Reconstruction policies.[29] Realizing that the old issues were holding it back, the Democrats tried a \"New Departure\" that downplayed the War and stressed such issues as corruption and white supremacy.\nRegardless, war hero Ulysses S. Grant led the Republicans to landslides in 1868 and 1872.[30]\nThe Democrats lost consecutive presidential elections from 1860 through 1880 (1876 was in dispute) and did not win the presidency until 1884. The party was weakened by its record of opposition to the war, but nevertheless benefited from White Southerners' resentment of Reconstruction and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. The nationwide depression of 1873 allowed the Democrats to retake control of the House in the 1874 Democratic landslide.[citation needed]\nThe Redeemers gave the Democrats control of every Southern state (by the Compromise of 1877), but the disenfranchisement of blacks took place (1880\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1900). From 1880 to 1960, the \"Solid South\" voted Democratic in presidential elections (except 1928). After 1900, a victory in a Democratic primary was \"tantamount to election\" because the Republican Party was so weak in the South.[citation needed]\nAlthough Republicans continued to control the White House until 1884, the Democrats remained competitive (especially in the mid-Atlantic and lower Midwest) and controlled the House of Representatives for most of that period. In the election of 1884, Grover Cleveland, the reforming Democratic Governor of New York, won the Presidency, a feat he repeated in 1892, having lost in the election of 1888.[citation needed]\nCleveland was the leader of the Bourbon Democrats. They represented business interests, supported banking and railroad goals, promoted laissez-faire capitalism, opposed imperialism and U.S. overseas expansion, opposed the annexation of Hawaii, fought for the gold standard and opposed Bimetallism. They strongly supported reform movements such as Civil Service Reform and opposed corruption of city bosses, leading the fight against the Tweed Ring.[citation needed]\nThe leading Bourbons included Samuel J. Tilden, David Bennett Hill and William C. Whitney of New York, Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Henry M. Mathews and William L. Wilson of West Virginia, John Griffin Carlisle of Kentucky, William F. Vilas of Wisconsin, J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska, John M. Palmer of Illinois, Horace Boies of Iowa, Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar of Mississippi and railroad builder James J. Hill of Minnesota. A prominent intellectual was Woodrow Wilson.[31]\nThe Bourbons were in power when the Panic of 1893 hit and they took the blame. A fierce struggle inside the party ensued, with catastrophic losses for both the Bourbon and agrarian factions in 1894, leading to the showdown in 1896. Just before the 1894 election, President Cleveland was warned by an advisor:\nThe warning was appropriate, for the Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. However, Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The opposition Democrats were close to controlling two thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. However, they were not united and had no national leader, as Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.[33]\nReligious divisions were sharply drawn.[34] Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other pietists in the North were closely linked to the Republican Party. In sharp contrast, liturgical groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition. Both parties cut across the class structure, with the Democrats gaining more support from the lower classes and Republicans more support from the upper classes.[citation needed]\nCultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became matters of contention because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50 percent of voters were pietistic Protestants (Methodists, Scandinavian Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Disciples of Christ) who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking.[34]\nLiturgical churches (Roman Catholics, German Lutherans and Episcopalians) comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of the morality business. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decade, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry Republicans.[34]\nGrover Cleveland led the party faction of conservative, pro-business Bourbon Democrats, but as the depression of 1893 deepened his enemies multiplied. At the 1896 convention, the silverite-agrarian faction repudiated the President and nominated the crusading orator William Jennings Bryan on a platform of free coinage of silver. The idea was that minting silver coins would flood the economy with cash and end the depression. Cleveland supporters formed the National Democratic Party (Gold Democrats), which attracted politicians and intellectuals (including Woodrow Wilson and Frederick Jackson Turner) who refused to vote Republican.[35]\nBryan, an overnight sensation because of his \"Cross of Gold\" speech, waged a new-style crusade against the supporters of the gold standard. Criss-crossing the Midwest and East by special train \u2013 he was the first candidate since 1860 to go on the road \u2013 he gave over 500 speeches to audiences in the millions. In St. Louis he gave 36 speeches to workingmen's audiences across the city, all in one day. Most Democratic newspapers were hostile toward Bryan, but he seized control of the media by making the news every day as he hurled thunderbolts against Eastern monied interests.[36]\nThe rural folk in the South and Midwest were ecstatic, showing an enthusiasm never before seen, but ethnic Democrats (especially Germans and Irish) were alarmed and frightened by Bryan. The middle classes, businessmen, newspaper editors, factory workers, railroad workers and prosperous farmers generally rejected Bryan's crusade. Republican William McKinley promised a return to prosperity based on the gold standard, support for industry, railroads and banks and pluralism that would enable every group to move ahead.[36]\nAlthough Bryan lost the election in a landslide, he did win the hearts and minds of a majority of Democrats, as shown by his renomination in 1900 and 1908. As late as 1924, the Democrats put his brother Charles W. Bryan on their national ticket.[37] The victory of the Republican Party in the election of 1896 marked the start of the \"Progressive Era\", which lasted from 1896 to 1932, in which the Republican Party usually was dominant.[38]\nThe 1896 election marked a political realignment in which the Republican Party controlled the presidency for 28 of 36 years. The Republicans dominated most of the Northeast and Midwest and half the West. Bryan, with a base in the South and Plains states, was strong enough to get the nomination in 1900 (losing to William McKinley) and 1908 (losing to William Howard Taft). Theodore Roosevelt dominated the first decade of the century and to the annoyance of Democrats \"stole\" the trust issue by crusading against trusts.[39]\nAnti-Bryan conservatives controlled the convention in 1904, but faced a Theodore Roosevelt landslide. Bryan dropped his free silver and anti-imperialism rhetoric and supported mainstream progressive issues, such as the income tax, anti-trust and direct election of Senators.\nTaking advantage of a deep split in the Republican Party, the Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected the intellectual reformer Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and 1916.[40] Wilson successfully led Congress to a series of progressive laws, including a reduced tariff, stronger antitrust laws, new programs for farmers, hours-and-pay benefits for railroad workers and the outlawing of child labor (which was reversed by the Supreme Court).[41]\nWilson tolerated the segregation of the federal Civil Service by Southern cabinet members. Furthermore, bipartisan constitutional amendments for prohibition and women's suffrage were passed in his second term. In effect, Wilson laid to rest the issues of tariffs, money and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years.[41]\nWilson oversaw the U.S. role in World War I and helped write the Versailles Treaty, which included the League of Nations. However, in 1919 Wilson's political skills faltered and suddenly everything turned sour. The Senate rejected Versailles and the League, a nationwide wave of violent, unsuccessful strikes and race riots caused unrest and Wilson's health collapsed.[42]\nThe Democrats lost by a huge landslide in 1920, doing especially poorly in the cities, where the German-Americans deserted the ticket; and the Irish Catholics, who dominated the party apparatus, sat on their hands.\nAlthough they recovered considerable ground in the Congressional elections of 1922, the entire decade saw the Democrats as a helpless minority in Congress and as a weak force in most Northern states.[43]\nAt the 1924 Democratic National Convention, a resolution denouncing the Ku Klux Klan was introduced by forces allied with Al Smith and Oscar W. Underwood in order to embarrass the front-runner, William Gibbs McAdoo. After much debate, the resolution failed by a single vote. The KKK faded away soon after, but the deep split in the party over cultural issues, especially prohibition, facilitated Republican landslides in 1920, 1924 and 1928.[44] However, Al Smith did build a strong Catholic base in the big cities in 1928 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as Governor of New York that year brought a new leader to center stage.[45]\nThe stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression set the stage for a more progressive government and Franklin D. Roosevelt won a landslide victory in the election of 1932, campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"The New Deal\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.[citation needed]\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from laissez-faire capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.[citation needed]\nConservative Democrats were outraged and led by Al Smith they formed the American Liberty League in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as Dean Acheson, found their way back to the Democratic Party.[citation needed]\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The Second New Deal\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the WPA, setting up Social Security, imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.[citation needed]\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through public works projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the New Deal coalition, which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and liberals. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.[citation needed]\nAfter a triumphant re-election in 1936, he announced plans to enlarge the Supreme Court, which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President John Nance Garner. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a conservative coalition that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a minimum wage law got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.[citation needed]\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of social welfare, labor unions, civil rights and the regulation of business. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".[citation needed]\nHarry Truman took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the AFL, CIO and ideological groups such as the NAACP (representing Blacks), the American Jewish Congress (AJC) and the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).[46] By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.[47]\nOn the right, the Republicans blasted Truman's domestic policies. \"Had Enough?\" was the winning slogan as Republicans recaptured Congress in 1946 for the first time since 1928.[48]\nMany party leaders were ready to dump Truman in 1948, but after General Dwight D. Eisenhower rejected their invitation they lacked an alternative. Truman counterattacked, pushing J. Strom Thurmond and his Dixiecrats out, as well as taking advantage of the splits inside the Republican Party and was thus reelected in a stunning surprise. However, all of Truman's Fair Deal proposals, such as universal health care, were defeated by the Southern Democrats in Congress. His seizure of the steel industry was reversed by the Supreme Court.[citation needed]\nOn the far-left, former Vice President Henry A. Wallace denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan and NATO. Wallace quit the party and ran for President as an independent in 1948. He called for d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union, but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions. Wallace fared poorly and helped turn the anti-communist vote toward Truman.[49]\nBy cooperating with internationalist Republicans, Truman succeeded in defeating isolationists on the right and supporters of softer lines on the Soviet Union on the left to establish a Cold War program that lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like Hubert Humphrey, Walter Reuther and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.\u00a0Hollywood emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as Ronald Reagan, who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.[citation needed]\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the Korean War without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956, only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.[citation needed]\nIn Congress, the powerful duo of House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority leader Lyndon B. Johnson held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).[citation needed]\nMost Southern Congressmen were conservative Democrats and they usually worked with conservative Republicans. The result was a conservative coalition that blocked practically all liberal domestic legislation from 1937 to the 1970s, except for a brief spell 1964\u20131965, when Johnson neutralized its power. The counterbalance to the conservative coalition was the Democratic Study Group, which led the charge to liberalize the institutions of Congress and eventually pass a great deal of the Kennedy\u2013Johnson program.[citation needed]\nThe election of John F. Kennedy in 1960 over then-Vice President Richard Nixon re-energized the party. His youth, vigor and intelligence caught the popular imagination. New programs like the Peace Corps harnessed idealism. In terms of legislation, Kennedy was stalemated by the conservative coalition.[citation needed]\nThough Kennedy's term in office lasted only about a thousand days, he tried to hold back communist gains after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba and the construction of the Berlin Wall and sent 16,000 soldiers to Vietnam to advise the hard-pressed South Vietnamese army. He challenged America in the Space Race to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the Cuban Missile Crisis he moved to de-escalate tensions with the Soviet Union.[citation needed]\nKennedy also pushed for civil rights and racial integration, one example being Kennedy assigning federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders in the South. His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of Richard J. Daley, the last of the Democratic machines faded away. President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.[citation needed]\nThen-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the new President. Johnson, heir to the New Deal ideals, broke the conservative coalition in Congress and passed a remarkable number of laws, known as the Great Society. Johnson succeeded in passing major civil rights laws that restarted racial integration in the South. At the same time, Johnson escalated the Vietnam War, leading to an inner conflict inside the Democratic Party that shattered the party in the elections of 1968.[citation needed]\nThe Democratic Party platform of the 1960s was largely formed by the ideals of President Johnson's \"Great Society\" The New Deal coalition began to fracture as more Democratic leaders voiced support for civil rights, upsetting the party's traditional base of Southern Democrats and Catholics in Northern cities. After Harry Truman's platform gave strong support to civil rights and anti-segregation laws during the 1948 Democratic National Convention, many Southern Democratic delegates decided to split from the party and formed the \"Dixiecrats\", led by South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond (who as Senator would later join the Republican Party). However, few other Democrats left the party.[citation needed]\nOn the other hand, African Americans, who had traditionally given strong support to the Republican Party since its inception as the \"anti-slavery party\", continued to shift to the Democratic Party, largely due to the advocacy of and support for civil rights by such prominent Democrats as Hubert Humphrey and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; and to a lesser extent economic opportunities offered by the New Deal relief programs. Although Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower carried half the South in 1952 and 1956 and Senator Barry Goldwater also carried five Southern states in 1964, Democrat Jimmy Carter carried all of the South except Virginia and there was no long-term realignment until Ronald Reagan's sweeping victories in the South in 1980 and 1984.[citation needed]\nThe party's dramatic reversal on civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act was passed in both House and Senate by a Republican majority. Many of the Democrats, mostly Southern Democrats opposed the act. Meanwhile, the Republicans led again by Richard Nixon were beginning to implement their new economic policies which aimed to resist federal encroachment on the states, while appealing to conservative and moderate in the rapidly growing cities and suburbs of the South.[citation needed]\nThe year 1968 marked a major crisis for the party. In January, even though it was a military defeat for the Viet Cong, the Tet Offensive began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator Eugene McCarthy rallied intellectuals and anti-war students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the New Hampshire primary:Johnson was permanently weakened. Four days later, Senator Robert Kennedy, brother of the late President, entered the race.[50]\nJohnson stunned the nation on March 31 when he withdrew from the race and four weeks later his Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, entered the race, though he did not run in any primary. Kennedy and McCarthy traded primary victories while Humphrey gathered the support of labor unions and the big-city bosses. Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but he was assassinated that night. Even as Kennedy won California, Humphrey had already amassed 1,000 of the 1,312 delegate votes needed for the nomination, while Kennedy had about 700).[50]\nDuring the 1968 Democratic National Convention, while police and the National Guard violently confronted anti-war protesters on the streets and parks of Chicago, the Democrats nominated Humphrey. Meanwhile, Alabama's Democratic governor George C. Wallace launched a third-party campaign and at one point was running second to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress. The party was now so deeply split that it would not again win a majority of the popular vote for president until 1976, when Jimmy Carter won the popular vote in 1976 with 50.1%.[citation needed]\nThe degree to which the Southern Democrats had abandoned the party became evident in the 1968 presidential election when the electoral votes of every former Confederate state except Texas went to either Republican Richard Nixon or independent Wallace. Humphrey's electoral votes came mainly from the Northern states, marking a dramatic reversal from the 1948 election 20 years earlier, when the losing Republican electoral votes were concentrated in the same states.[citation needed]\nFollowing the 1968 debacle, the McGovern-Fraser Commission proposed and the party adopted far-reaching changes in how national convention delegates were selected. More power over the presidential nominee selection accrued to the rank and file and presidential primaries became significantly more important. In 1972, the Democrats nominated Senator George McGovern (SD) as the presidential candidate on a platform which advocated, among other things, immediate U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam (with his anti-war slogan \"Come Home, America!\") and a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans. McGovern's forces at the national convention ousted Mayor Richard J. Daley and the entire Chicago delegation, replacing them with insurgents led by Jesse Jackson. After it became known that McGovern's running mate Thomas Eagleton had received electric shock therapy, McGovern said he supported Eagleton \"1000%\", but he was soon forced to drop him and find a new running mate.[51]\nNumerous top names turned him down, but McGovern finally selected Sargent Shriver, a Kennedy in-law who was close to Mayor Daley. On July 14, 1972, McGovern appointed his campaign manager, Jean Westwood, as the first woman chair of the Democratic National Committee. McGovern was defeated in a landslide by incumbent Richard Nixon, winning only Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.[52]\nThe sordid Watergate scandal soon destroyed the Nixon Presidency, giving the Democrats a flicker of hope. With Gerald Ford's pardon of Nixon soon after his resignation in 1974, the Democrats used the \"corruption\" issue to make major gains in the off-year elections. In 1976, mistrust of the administration, complicated by a combination of economic recession and inflation, sometimes called \"stagflation\", led to Ford's defeat by Jimmy Carter, a former Governor of Georgia. Carter won as a little-known outsider by promising honesty in Washington, a message that played well to voters as he swept the South and won narrowly.[53]\nCarter had served as a naval officer, a farmer, a state senator and a one-term governor. His only experience with federal politics was when he chaired the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial elections in 1974. Some of Carter's major accomplishments consisted of the creation of a national energy policy and the consolidation of governmental agencies, resulting in two new cabinet departments, the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of Education. Carter also successfully deregulated the trucking, airline, rail, finance, communications and oil industries (thus backtracking on the New Deal approach to regulation of the economy), bolstered the social security system and appointed record numbers of women and minorities to significant government and judicial posts. He also enacted strong legislation on environmental protection through the expansion of the National Park Service in Alaska, creating 103 million acres (417,000\u00a0km\u00b2) of park land.[54]\nIn foreign affairs, Carter's accomplishments consisted of the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the establishment of full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and the negotiation of the SALT II Treaty. In addition, he championed human rights throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.[55]\nEven with all of these successes, Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system as he had promised in his campaign and inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In 1980, Carter defeated Senator Ted Kennedy to gain renomination, but lost to Ronald Reagan in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.[55] After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.[56]\nDemocrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1980. The \"Reagan Democrats\" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and for George H. W. Bush in 1988, producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's social conservatism on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in 1992 or 1996, so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe White Southerners who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.[57]\nStan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, analyzed white ethnic voters \u2013 largely unionized auto workers \u2013 in suburban Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, advocacy groups of the political left and the very poor.[57]\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In 1984, Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale, a New Deal stalwart.[58]\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a catch all party with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in 1988 to Vice President George H. W. Bush.[59]\nFor nearly a century after Reconstruction, the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the Solid South, although the Republicans controlled parts of the Appalachian mountains and they competed for statewide office in the border states. Before 1948, Southern Democrats believed that their party, with its respect for states' rights and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".[citation needed]\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981, which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the following election, as Southern Democrats Strom Thurmond ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the Civil Rights Movement and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".[60]\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte and Houston to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation.[citation needed]\nIntegration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors Orval Faubus of Arkansas, Lester Maddox of Georgia and especially George Wallace of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).[citation needed]\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional White Southerners joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80-90-percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as Julian Bond and John Lewis of Georgia and Barbara Jordan of Texas. Just as Martin Luther King had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics. The Republican Party's Southern strategy further alienated black voters from the party.[citation needed]\nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among evangelical Christians, who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the 2004 presidential election showed that George W. Bush led John Kerry by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who comprised 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.[61]\nThe Democrats included a strong element that came of age in opposition to the Vietnam War and remained hostile toward American military interventions. On August 1, 1990, Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait. President Bush formed an international coalition and secured United Nations approval to expel Iraq. Congress on January 12, 1991 authorized by a narrow margin the use of military force against Iraq, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The vote in the House was 250\u00e2\u20ac\u201c183 and in the Senate 52-47. In the Senate, 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats voted yes to war, while 45 Democrats and two Republicans voted no. In the House, 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted yes and 179 Democrats, three Republicans and one Independent voted no.[62] The Gulf War, a military operation known as \"Desert Storm\", was short and successful, but Hussein was allowed to remain in power. The Arab countries (and Japan) repaid all the American military costs.[citation needed]\nIn the 1990s, the Democratic Party revived itself, in part by moving to the right on economic policy.[citation needed] In 1992, for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President Bill Clinton's term, the Congress balanced the federal budget for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several gun control bills, including the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a ban on many types of semi-automatic firearms (which expired in 2004). His Family and Medical Leave Act, covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to Haiti to reinstate deposed president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, took a strong hand in Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, brokered a historic cease-fire in Northern Ireland and negotiated the Dayton accords. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since Franklin D. Roosevelt.[citation needed]\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed welfare reform bills before signing the third, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. The tort reform Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico over unions' strong objections.[63] In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives impeached Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the United States Senate in 1999. Under Clinton's leadership, the United States participated in NATO's Operation Allied Force against Yugoslavia that year.[citation needed]\nIn the 1990s the Clinton Administration continued the free market, or neoliberal, reforms which began under the Reagan Administration.[64][65] However, economist Sebastian Mallaby argues that the party increasingly adopted pro-business, pro free market principles after 1976:\nHistorian Walter Scheidel also posits that both parties shifted to free markets in the 1970s:\nAs the DLC attempted to move the Democratic agenda to the right (to a more centrist position), prominent Democrats from both the centrist and conservative factions (such as Terry McAuliffe) assumed leadership of the party and its direction. Some liberals and progressives felt alienated by the Democratic Party, which they felt had become unconcerned with the interests of the common people and left-wing issues in general. Some Democrats challenged the validity of such critiques, citing the Democratic role in pushing for progressive reforms.[citation needed]\nDuring the 2000 presidential election, the Democrats chose Vice President Al Gore to be the party's candidate for the Presidency. Gore ran against George W. Bush, the Republican candidate and son of former President George H.W. Bush. The issues Gore championed include debt reduction, tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, global warming, judicial appointments and affirmative action. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the Electoral College by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party spoiler role for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from politics for years, though by 2005 he was making speeches critical of Bush's foreign policy.[citation needed]\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of Hillary Clinton in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic Caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.[citation needed]\nIn the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the nation's focus was changed to issues of national security. All but one Democrat (Representative Barbara Lee) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. House leader Richard Gephardt and Senate leader Thomas Daschle pushed Democrats to vote for the USA PATRIOT Act and the invasion of Iraq. The Democrats were split over entering Iraq in 2003 and increasingly expressed concerns about both the justification and progress of the War on Terrorism, as well as the domestic effects, including threats to civil rights and civil liberties, from the Patriot act. Senator Russ Feingold was the only Senator to vote against the act.[citation needed][68]\nIn the wake of the financial fraud scandal of the Enron Corporation and other corporations, Congressional Democrats pushed for a legal overhaul of business accounting with the intention of preventing further accounting fraud. This led to the bipartisan Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.[citation needed]\nThey lost three seats in the Senate (Georgia as Max Cleland was unseated, Minnesota as Paul Wellstone died and his succeeding Democratic candidate lost the election and Missouri as Jean Carnahan was unseated) in the Senate. While Democrats gained governorships in New Mexico (where Bill Richardson was elected), Arizona (Janet Napolitano), Michigan (Jennifer Granholm) and Wyoming (Dave Freudenthal). Other Democrats lost governorships in South Carolina (Jim Hodges), Alabama (Don Siegelman) and\u2014for the first time in more than a century\u2014Georgia (Roy Barnes).[citation needed]\nThe election led to another round of soul searching about the party's narrowing base. Democrats had further losses 2003, when a voter recall unseated the unpopular Democratic governor of California Gray Davis and replaced him with Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. By the end of 2003, the four most populous states had Republican governors: California, Texas, New York and Florida.[citation needed]\nThe 2004 campaign started as early as December 2002, when Gore announced he would not run again in the 2004 election. Howard Dean, former Governor of Vermont, an opponent of the war and a critic of the Democratic establishment, was the front-runner leading into the Democratic primaries. Dean had immense grassroots support, especially from the left-wing of the party. Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, a more centrist figure with heavy support from the Democratic Leadership Council, was nominated because he was seen as more \"electable\" than Dean.[69]\nAs layoffs of American workers occurred in various industries due to outsourcing, some Democrats (including Dean and senatorial candidate Erskine Bowles of North Carolina) began to refine their positions on free trade and some even questioned their past support for it. By 2004, the failure of George W. Bush's administration to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, mounting combat casualties and fatalities in the ongoing Iraq War, as well as the lack of any end point for the War on Terror were frequently debated issues in the election. That year, Democrats generally campaigned on surmounting the jobless recovery, solving the Iraq crisis and fighting terrorism more efficiently.[citation needed]\nIn the end, Kerry lost both the popular vote (by 3 million out of over 120 million votes cast) and the Electoral College. Republicans also gained four seats in the Senate (leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, their fewest since the 1920s) and three seats in the House of Representatives. Also for the first time since 1952, the Democratic leader of the Senate lost re-election. In the end, there were 3,660 Democratic state legislators across the nation to the Republicans' 3,557. Democrats gained governorships in Louisiana, New Hampshire and Montana. However, they lost the governorship of Missouri and a legislative majority in Georgia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had long been a Democratic stronghold. Senate pickups for the Democrats included Ken Salazar in Colorado and 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote speaker Barack Obama in Illinois.[citation needed]\nThere were many reasons for the defeat and after the election most analysts concluded that Kerry was a poor campaigner.[70][71] A group of Vietnam veterans opposed to Kerry called the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth undercut Kerry's use of his military past as a campaign strategy. Kerry was unable to reconcile his initial support of the Iraq War with his opposition to the war in 2004 or manage the deep split in the Democratic Party between those who favored and opposed the war.[70]\nRepublicans ran thousands of television commercials to argue that Kerry had flip-flopped on Iraq. When Kerry's home state of Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage, the issue split liberal and conservative Democrats and independents (Kerry publicly stated throughout his campaign that he opposed same-sex marriage, but favored civil unions). Republicans exploited the same-sex marriage issue by promoting ballot initiatives in 11 states that brought conservatives to the polls in large numbers: all 11 initiatives passed.[72]\nFlaws in vote-counting systems may also have played a role in Kerry's defeat (see 2004 United States election voting controversies). Senator Barbara Boxer of California and several Democratic U.S. Representatives (including John Conyers of Michigan) raised the issue of voting irregularities in Ohio when the 109th Congress first convened, but they were defeated 267\u00e2\u20ac\u201c31 by the House and 74-1 by the Senate. Other factors included a healthy job market, a rising stock market, strong home sales and low unemployment.[citation needed]\nAfter the 2004 election, prominent Democrats began to rethink the party's direction and a variety of strategies for moving forward were voiced. Some Democrats proposed moving towards the right to regain seats in the House and Senate and possibly win the Presidency in the election of 2008, while others demanded that the party move more to the left and become a stronger opposition party. One topic of discussion was the party's policies surrounding reproductive rights.[citation needed]\nRethinking the party's position on gun control became a matter of discussion, brought up by Howard Dean, Bill Richardson, Brian Schweitzer and other Democrats who had won governorships in states where Second Amendment rights were important to many voters. In What's the Matter with Kansas?, commentator Thomas Frank wrote that the Democrats needed to return to campaigning on economic populism.[citation needed]\nThese debates were reflected in the 2005 campaign for Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which Howard Dean won over the objections of many party insiders. Dean sought to move the Democratic strategy away from the establishment and bolster support for the party's state organizations, even in red states (the fifty-state strategy).[73]\nWhen the 109th Congress convened, Harry Reid, the new Senate Minority Leader, tried to convince the Democratic Senators to vote more as a bloc on important issues and he forced the Republicans to abandon their push for privatization of Social Security. In 2005, the Democrats retained their governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, electing Tim Kaine and Jon Corzine, respectively. However, the party lost the mayoral race in New York City, a Democratic stronghold, for the fourth straight time.[citation needed]\nWith scandals involving lobbyist Jack Abramoff as well as Duke Cunningham, Tom DeLay, Mark Foley and Bob Taft, the Democrats used the slogan \"Culture of corruption\" against the Republicans during the 2006 campaign. Negative public opinion on the Iraq War, widespread dissatisfaction over the ballooning federal deficit and the inept handling of the Hurricane Katrina disaster dragged down President Bush's job approval ratings.[citation needed]\nAs a result of the 2006 midterm elections, the Democratic Party became the majority party in the House of Representatives and its caucus in the United States Senate constituted a majority when the 110th Congress convened in 2007. The Democrats had spent twelve successive years as the minority party in the House before the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats also went from controlling a minority of governorships to a majority. The number of seats held by party members likewise increased in various state legislatures, giving the Democrats control of a plurality of them nationwide. No Democratic incumbent was defeated and no Democratic-held open seat was lost in either the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, or with regards to any governorship.[citation needed]\nThe Democratic Party's electoral success has been attributed by some to running conservative-leaning Democrats against at-risk Republican incumbents,[74] while others claim that running more populists and progressive candidates has been the source of success.[75] Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters.[76]\nIn the 2006 Democratic caucus leadership elections, Democrats chose Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland for House Majority Leader and nominated Representative Nancy Pelosi of California for speaker. Senate Democrats chose Harry Reid of Nevada for United States Senate Majority Leader. Pelosi was elected as the first female House speaker at the commencement of the 110th Congress. The House soon passed the measures that comprised the Democrats' 100-Hour Plan.[citation needed]\nThe 2008 Democratic presidential primaries left two candidates in close competition: Illinois Senator Barack Obama and New York Senator Hillary Clinton. Both had won more support within a major American political party than any previous African American or female candidate. Before official ratification at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Obama emerged as the party's presumptive nominee. With President George W. Bush of the Republican Party ineligible for a third term and the Vice President Dick Cheney not pursuing his party's nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona more quickly emerged as the GOP nominee.[77]\nThroughout most of the 2008 general election, polls showed a close race between Obama and John McCain. However, Obama maintained a small but widening lead over McCain in the wake of the liquidity crisis of September 2008.[citation needed]\nOn November 4, Obama defeated McCain by a significant margin in the Electoral College and the party also made further gains in the Senate and House, adding to its 2006 gains.[citation needed]\nOn January 20, 2009, Obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the United States in a ceremony attended by nearly 2 million people, the largest congregation of spectators ever to witness the inauguration of a new President.[78] That same day in Washington, D.C., Republican House of Representative leaders met in an \"invitation only\" meeting for four hours to discuss the future of the Republican Party under the Obama administration. During the meeting, they agreed to bring Congress to a standstill regardless of how much it would hurt the American economy by pledging to obstruct and block President Obama on all legislation.\nOne of the first acts by the Obama administration after assuming control was an order signed by Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel that suspended all pending federal regulations proposed by outgoing President George W. Bush so that they could be reviewed. This was comparable to prior moves by the Bush administration upon assuming control from Bill Clinton, who in his final 20 days in office issued 12 executive orders.[79] In his first week, Obama also established a policy of producing a weekly Saturday morning video address available on Whitehouse.gov and YouTube, much like those released during his transition period. The policy is likened to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats and George W. Bush's weekly radio addresses.\nPresident Obama signed into law the following significant legislation during his first 100 days in the White House: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Also during his first 100 days, the Obama administration reversed the following significant George W. Bush administration policies: supporting the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, relaxing enforcement of cannabis laws and lifting the 7\u00c2\u00bd-year ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Obama also issued Executive Order 13492, ordering the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, although it has remained open throughout his presidency. He also lifted some travel and money restrictions to the island, ended the Mexico City Policy and signed an order requiring the Army Field Manual to be used as guide for terror interrogations, which banned torture and other coercive techniques, such as waterboarding.\nObama also announced stricter guidelines regarding lobbyists in an effort to raise the ethical standards of the White House.[80] The new policy bans aides from attempting to influence the administration for at least two years if they leave his staff. It also bans aides on staff from working on matters they have previously lobbied on, or to approach agencies that they targeted while on staff. Their ban also included a gift-giving ban.[81] However, one day later he nominated William J. Lynn III, a lobbyist for defence contractor Raytheon, for the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense.[82][83] Obama later nominated William Corr, an anti-tobacco lobbyist, for Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services.[84]\nDuring the beginning of Obama Presidency emerged the Tea Party movement, a conservative movement that began to heavily influence the Republican Party within the United States, shifting the GOP further right-wing and partisan in their ideology. On February 18, 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by summer.[85] The announcement followed the recommendation of several experts including Defense Secretary Robert Gates that additional troops be deployed to the strife-torn South Asian country.[86] On February 27, 2009, Obama addressed Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and outlined an exit strategy for the Iraq War. Obama promised to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq by August 31, 2010 and a \"transitional force\" of up to 50,000 counterterrorism, advisory, training and support personnel by the end of 2011.[87]\nObama signed two presidential memorandum concerning energy independence, ordering the Department of Transportation to establish higher fuel efficiency standards before 2011 models are released and allowing states to raise their emissions standards above the national standard. Due to the economic crisis, the President enacted a pay freeze for senior White House staff making more than $100,000 per year.[88] The action affected approximately 120 staffers and added up to about a $443,000 savings for the United States government.[89] On March 10, 2009, in a meeting with the New Democrat Coalition, Obama told them that he was a \"New Democrat\", \"pro-growth Democrat\", \"supports free and fair trade\" and \"very concerned about a return to protectionism\".[90]\nOn May 26, 2009, President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Sotomayor was confirmed by the Senate becoming the highest ranking government official of Puerto Rican heritage ever. On July 1, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. On July 7, 2009, Al Franken was sworn into the Senate, thus Senate Democrats obtained the 60 vote threshold to overcome the Senate filibuster.\nOn October 28, 2009, Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which included in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 decision in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that the First Amendment prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation. On February 4, 2010, Republican Scott Brown of Massachusetts was sworn into the Senate, thus ending Senate Democrats 60 vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law his signature legislation of his presidency, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. On May 10, 2010, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Elena Kagan was confirmed by the Senate on August 5, 2010 by a 63\u201337 vote. Kagan was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts on August 7, 2010.\nOn 19 August 2010, the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division was the last American combat brigade to withdraw from Iraq. In a speech at the Oval Office on 31 August 2010, Obama declared: \"[T]he American combat mission in Iraq has ended. Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country\".[91][92] About 50,000 American troops remained in the country in an advisory capacity as part of \"Operation New Dawn\", which ran until the end of 2011. New Dawn was the final designated U.S. campaign of the war. The U.S. military continued to train and advise the Iraqi Forces, as well as participate in combat alongside them.[93]\nOn November 2, 2010 during the 2010 midterm elections, the Democratic Party had a net loss of six seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House. Control of the House of Representatives switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. The Democrats lost a net of six state governorships and a net 680 seats in state legislatures. The Democrats lost control of seven state Senate legislatures and 13 state Houses. This was the worst performance of the Democratic Party in a national election since the 1946 elections. The Blue Dog Coalition numbers in the House were reduced from 54 members in 2008 to 26 members in 2011 and were half of the Democratic defeats during the election. This was the first United States national election in which Super PACs were used by Democrats and Republicans. Many commentators contribute the electoral success of the Republican Party in 2010 to the conservative Super PACs' campaign spending, Tea Party movement, backlash against President Obama, failure to mobilize the Obama coalition to get out and vote and the failure of President Obama to enact many of his progressive and liberal campaign promises.\nOn December 1, 2010, Obama announced at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point that the U.S. would send 30,000 more troops.[94] Anti-war organizations in the U.S. responded quickly and cities throughout the U.S. saw protests on 2 December.[95] Many protesters compared the decision to deploy more troops in Afghanistan to the expansion of the Vietnam War under the Johnson administration.[96]\nDuring the lameduck session of the 111th United States Congress, President Obama signed into law the following significant legislation: Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, Shark Conservation Act of 2010 and the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010. On December 18, 2010, the Arab Spring began. On 22 December 2010, the U.S. Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of New START by a vote of 71 to 26 on the resolution of ratification. The 111th United States Congress has been considered one of the most productive Congresses in history in terms of legislation passed since the 89th Congress, during Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.[97][98][99][100]\nOn February 23, 2011, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced the United States federal government would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act within federal courts. In response to the First Libyan Civil War, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined with U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Office of Multilateral and Human Rights Director Samantha Power led the hawkish diplomatic team within the Obama administration that helped convince President Obama in favor airstrikes against Libyan government. On March 19, 2011, the United States began military intervention in Libya.\nUnited States domestic reaction to the 2011 military intervention in Libya were mixed in the Democratic Party. Opponents to the 2011 military intervention in Libya within the Democratic Party include Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Sen. Jim Webb, Rep. Raul Grijalva, Rep. Mike Honda, Rep. Lynn Woolsey and Rep. Barbara Lee. The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), an organization of progressive Democrats, said that the United States should conclude its campaign against Libyan air defenses as soon as possible. Support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya within the Democratic Party include President Bill Clinton, Sen. Carl Levin, Sen. Dick Durbin, Sen. Jack Reed, Sen. John Kerry, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Legal Adviser of the Department of State Harold Hongju Koh and Ed Schultz.\nOn April 5, 2011, Vice President Joe Biden announced that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was President Obama's choice to succeed Tim Kaine as the 52nd Chair of the Democratic National Committee. On May 26, 2011, President Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, which was strongly criticized by some in the Democratic Party as violation of civil liberties and a continuation of the George W. Bush administration. House Democrats largely opposed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, while Senate Democrats were slightly in favor of it.\nOn October 21, 2011, President Obama signed into law three of the following United States free trade agreements: Free trade agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, Panama\u2013United States Trade Promotion Agreement and the United States\u2013Colombia Free Trade Agreement. In the House of Representatives, Democratic Representatives largely opposed these agreements, while Senate Democrats were split on the agreements. This was a continuation of President Bill Clinton's policy of support for free trade agreements.\nWhen asked by David Gregory about his views on same-sex marriage on Meet the Press on May 5, 2012, Biden stated he supported same-sex marriage.[101] On May 9, 2012, a day after North Carolina voters approved Amendment 1, President Obama became the first sitting United States President to come out in favor of same-sex marriage.\nThe 2012 Democratic Party platform for Obama's reelection ran over 26,000 words and included his position on numerous national issues. On security issues, it pledges \"unshakable commitment to Israel's security\", says the party will try to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It calls for a strong military, but argues that in the current fiscal environment, tough budgetary decisions must include defense spending. On controversial social issues it supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage and says the party is \"strongly committed to enacting comprehensive immigration reform\". On the economic side the platform calls for extending the tax cuts for families earning under $250,000 and promises not to raise their taxes. It praises the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\", but does not use that term). It \"adamantly oppose any efforts to privatize Medicare\". On the rules of politics it attacks the recent Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that allows much greater political spending. It demands \"immediate action to curb the influence of lobbyists and special interests on our political institutions\".[102]\nIntense budget negotiations in the divided 112th Congress, wherein Democrats resolved to fight Republican demands for decreased spending and no tax hikes, threatened to shut down the government in April 2011[103] and later spurred fears that the United States would default on its debt. Continuing tight budgets were felt at the state level, where public-sector unions, a key Democratic constituency, battled Republican efforts to limit their collective bargaining powers in order to save money and reduce union power. This led to sustained protests by public-sector employees and walkouts by sympathetic Democratic legislators in states like Wisconsin and Ohio. The 2011 \"Occupy movement\". a campaign on the left for more accountable economic leadership, failed to have the impact on Democratic Party leadership and policy that the Tea Party movement had on the Republicans. ts leadership proved ineffective and the Occupy movement fizzled out. However, echoes could be found in the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2016.[104]\nConservatives criticized the president for \"passive\" responses to crises such as the 2009 Iranian protests and the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Additionally, liberal and Democratic activists objected to Obama's decisions to send reinforcements to Afghanistan, resume military trials of terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay and to help enforce a no-fly zone over Libya during that country's civil war. However, the demands of anti-war advocates were heeded when Obama followed through on a campaign promise to withdraw combat troops from Iraq.[citation needed]\nThe 2012 election was characterized by very high spending, especially on negative television ads in about ten critical states. Despite a weak economic recovery and high unemployment, the Obama campaign successfully mobilized its coalition of youth, blacks, Hispanics and women. The campaign carried all the same states as in 2008 except two, Indiana and North Carolina. The election continued the pattern whereby Democrats won more votes in all presidential elections after 1988, except for 2004. Obama and the Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, losing nine seats in that body and 13 in the GOP House.[citation needed]\nNational polling from 2013 to the summer of 2015 showed Hillary Clinton with an overwhelming commanding lead over all of her potential primary opponents. Her main challenger was independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, whose rallies grew larger and larger as he attracted overwhelming majorities among Democrats under age 40. The sharp divide between the two candidates was the establishment versus the political outsider, with Clinton being the establishment candidate and Sanders the outsider. Clinton received the endorsements from an overwhelming majority of office holders. Clinton's core base voters during the primary was women, African Americans, Latino Americans, LGBTs, moderates and older voters, while Sanders' core base included younger voters under age 40, men and progressives.\nThe ideological differences between the two candidates represented the ideological divide within the Democratic Party as a whole. Clinton, who cast herself as a moderate and a progressive, is ideologically more of a centrist representing the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama Third Way New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party. Bernie Sanders, who remained an independent in the Senate throughout the primaries (despite running for President as a Democrat), is a self described democratic socialist and is ideologically more of a progressive representing the Elizabeth Warren populist wing of the Democratic Party.[105]\nDuring the primaries, Sanders attacked Clinton for her ties to Wall Street and her previous support of the Defense of Marriage Act, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Keystone Pipeline, the 2011 military intervention in Libya and the Iraq War, while Clinton attacked Sanders for voting against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007.[106] Clinton generally moved to the left and adopted variations of some of Sanders' themes, such as trade and college tuition.[107] Although she was favored in the polls, she lost the general election to Trump in November despite winning the popular vote.\nAs of September 13, 2017, 16 Senate Democrats cosponsored the Medicare for All Act of 2017.[108] As of September 26, 2017, 120 House Democrats cosponsored the Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act.[109]\nOn January 12, 2017, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a 527 organization that focuses on redistricting reform and is affiliated with the Democratic Party. The chair, president and vice president of the umbrella organization is the 82th Attorney General Eric Holder, Elizabeth Pearson and Alixandria \"Ali\" Lapp respectively.[110] President Obama has said he would be involved with the committee.[111][112][113]\nAt the inauguration of Donald Trump, 67 Democratic members of the United States House of Representatives boycotted the inauguration.[114] This was the largest boycott by members of the United States Congress since the second inauguration of Richard Nixon, where it was estimated that between 80 and 200 Democratic members of United States Congress boycotted.[115]\nAt the 2017 Donald Trump speech to joint session of Congress, Representative Maxine Waters and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg both did not attend.[116]\nAs of January 19, 2018, 6 Democratic members of the United States House of Representatives will boycott the 2018 State of the Union Address\nOn January 23, 2017, Justice Democrats, political action committee, was created by Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks, Kyle Kulinski of Secular Talk, Saikat Chakrabarti and Zack Exley (both former leadership from the former 2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign). The organization, formed as a result of the 2016 United States presidential election, has a stated goal of reforming the Democratic Party by running \"a unified campaign to replace every corporate-backed member of Congress and rebuild the [Democratic] party from scratch\" starting in the 2018 Congressional midterms.[117][118]\nOn January 17, 2017, Third Way, a public policy think tank, launched New Blue, a $20 million campaign to study Democratic short comings in the 2016 elections and offer a new economic agenda to help Democrats reconnect with the voters who have abandoned the party. The money will be spent to conduct extensive research, reporting and polling in Rust Belt states that once formed a Blue Wall, but which voted for President Donald Trump in 2016.[119] Many progressives have criticized this as a desperate measure for the so-called establishment wing of the party to retain leadership.\nOn May 15, 2017, Onward Together, a political action organization was launched by Hillary Clinton to fundraise for liberal organizations, such as Swing Left, Indivisible, Color of Change, Emerge America, and Run for Something,.[120]\nThe 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election was characterized primarily as being between the two candidates for the chairmanship, United States Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district Keith Ellison and 26th United States Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. On February 25, 2017, Perez won the Democratic National Committee chairmanship and named Keith Ellison as Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee, a newly created position. The Obama administration pushed for Tom Perez to run against Keith Ellison and President Obama personally called DNC members to vote for Perez.[121][122]",

        "text": "The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the Bill of Rights.[1][2][3][4] The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the right belongs to individuals,[5][6] while also ruling that the right is not unlimited and does not prohibit all regulation of either firearms or similar devices.[7] State and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing this right, per the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.\nThe Second Amendment was based partially on the right to keep and bear arms in English common law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights of 1689. Sir William Blackstone described this right as an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense and resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state.[8]\nWhile both James Monroe and John Adams supported the Constitution being ratified, its most influential framer was James Madison. In Federalist No. 46, Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He confidently contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he contemptuously described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms.\" He assured his fellow citizens that they need never fear their government because \"besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".[9][10]\nBy January 1788, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut ratified the Constitution without insisting upon amendments. Several specific amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments. In the end, the ratification convention was so evenly divided between those for and against the Constitution that the federalists agreed to amendments to assure ratification. Samuel Adams proposed that the Constitution:\nIn United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that, \"The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second Amendments means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government\" and thus limited the scope of the Second Amendment's protections to the federal government.[11] In United States v. Miller (1939), the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not protect weapon types not having a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\".[12][13]\nIn the twenty-first century, the amendment has been subjected to renewed academic inquiry and judicial interest.[13] In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision that held the amendment protects an individual right to possess and carry firearms.[14][15] In McDonald v. Chicago (2010), the Court clarified its earlier decisions that limited the amendment's impact to a restriction on the federal government, expressly holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment against state and local governments.[16] In Caetano v. Massachusetts (2016), the Supreme Court reiterated its earlier rulings that \"the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\" and that its protection is not limited to \"only those weapons useful in warfare\".[17]\nDespite these decisions, the debate between various organizations regarding gun control and gun rights continues.[18]\nThere are several versions of the text of the Second Amendment, each with capitalization or punctuation differences. Differences exist between the drafted and ratified copies, the signed copies on display, and various published transcriptions.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] The importance (or lack thereof) of these differences has been the source of debate regarding the meaning and interpretation of the amendment, particularly regarding the importance of the prefatory clause.[27][28]\nOne version was passed by the Congress, and a slightly different version was ratified.[29][30][31][32][33] As passed by the Congress and preserved in the National Archives, with the rest of the original handwritten copy of the Bill of Rights prepared by scribe William Lambert, the amendment says:[34]\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\nHere is the amendment as ratified by the States and authenticated by Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State:[35]\nA well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\nThe right to bear arms in English history is believed to have been regarded in English law as an auxiliary to the long-established natural right of self-defense, auxiliary to the natural and legally defensible rights to life.[36] The English Bill of Rights of 1689 emerged from a tempestuous period in English politics during which two issues were major sources of conflict: the authority of the King to govern without the consent of Parliament, and the role of Catholics in a country that was becoming ever more Protestant. Ultimately, the Catholic James II was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, and his successors, the Protestants William III and Mary II, accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after James II had attempted to disarm many Protestants, and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.[37] The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.[38] In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.[39]\nThe text of the English Bill of Rights of 1689 includes language protecting the right of Protestants against disarmament by the Crown. This document states: \"That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.\"[40] It also contained text that aspired to bind future Parliaments, though under English constitutional law no Parliament can bind any later Parliament.[41] Nevertheless, the English Bill of Rights remains an important constitutional document, more for enumerating the rights of Parliament over the monarchy than for its clause concerning a right to have arms.\nThe statement in the English Bill of Rights concerning the right to bear arms is often quoted only in the passage where it is written as above and not in its full context. In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\nWhereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome (list of grievances including) ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, (Recital regarding the change of monarch) ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare (list of rights including) ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.[40]\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.[42][43]\nThe English Bill of Rights includes the proviso that arms must be as \"allowed by law.\" This has been the case before and after the passage of the Bill. While it did not override earlier restrictions on the ownership of guns for hunting, it is subject to the parliamentary right to implicitly or explicitly repeal earlier enactments.[44]\nThere is some difference of opinion as to how revolutionary the events of 1688\u00e2\u20ac\u201c89 actually were, and several commentators make the point that the provisions of the English Bill of Rights did not represent new laws, but rather stated existing rights. Mark Thompson wrote that, apart from determining the succession, the English Bill of Rights did \"little more than set forth certain points of existing laws and simply secured to Englishmen the rights of which they were already posessed  [sic].\"[45] Before and after the English Bill of Rights, the government could always disarm any individual or class of individuals it considered dangerous to the peace of the realm.[46] In 1765, William Blackstone wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England describing the right to have arms in England during the 18th century as a natural right of the subject that was \"also declared\" in the English Bill of Rights.[47][48]\nThe fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute 1 W. & M. st.2. c.2. and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.[49]\nAlthough there is little doubt that the writers of the Second Amendment were heavily influenced by the English Bill of Rights, it is a matter of interpretation as to whether they were intent on preserving the power to regulate arms to the states over the federal government (as the English Parliament had reserved for itself against the monarch) or whether it was intent on creating a new right akin to the right of others written into the Constitution (as the Supreme Court decided in Heller). Some in the United States have preferred the \"rights\" argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was not really in question. Peoples all around the world since time immemorial had armed themselves for the protection of themselves and others, and as organized nations began to appear these arrangements had been extended to the protection of the state.[50] Without a regular army and police force (which in England was not established until 1829), it had been the duty of certain men to keep watch and ward at night and to confront and capture suspicious persons. Every subject had an obligation to protect the king's peace and assist in the suppression of riots.[51]\nEarly English settlers in America viewed the right to arms and/or the right to bear arms and/or state militias as important for one or more of these purposes (in no particular order):[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60]\nWhich of these considerations were thought of as most important and ultimately found expression in the Second Amendment is disputed. Some of these purposes were explicitly mentioned in early state constitutions; for example, the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 asserted that, \"the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state\".[67]\nDuring the 1760s pre-revolutionary period, the established colonial militia was composed of colonists, including many who were loyal to British imperial rule. As defiance and opposition to British rule developed, a distrust of these Loyalists in the militia became widespread among the colonists, known as Patriots, who favored independence from British rule. As a result, some Patriots created their own militias that excluded the Loyalists and then sought to stock independent armories for their militias. In response to this arms build up, the British Parliament established an embargo of firearms, parts and ammunition against the American colonies.[68]\nBritish and Loyalist efforts to disarm the colonial Patriot militia armories in the early phases of the American Revolution resulted in the Patriot colonists protesting by citing the Declaration of Rights, Blackstone's summary of the Declaration of Rights, their own militia laws and common law rights to self-defense.[69] While British policy in the early phases of the Revolution clearly aimed to prevent coordinated action by the Patriot militia, some have argued that there is no evidence that the British sought to restrict the traditional common law right of self-defense.[69] Patrick J. Charles disputes these claims citing similar disarming by the patriots and challenging those scholars' interpretation of Blackstone.[70]\nThe right of the colonists to arms and rebellion against oppression was asserted, for example, in a pre-revolutionary newspaper editorial in 1769 Boston objecting to the British army suppression of colonial opposition to the Townshend Acts:\nInstances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such nature, and have been carried to such lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon its inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal: such violences are always to be apprehended from military troops, when quartered in the body of a populous city; but more especially so, when they are led to believe that they are become necessary to awe a spirit of rebellion, injuriously said to be existing therein. It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their own defence; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.[69]\nThe armed forces that won the American Revolution consisted of the standing Continental Army created by the Continental Congress, together with regular French army and naval forces and various state and regional militia units. In opposition, the British forces consisted of a mixture of the standing British Army, Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries. Following the Revolution, the United States was governed by the Articles of Confederation. Federalists argued that this government had an unworkable division of power between Congress and the states, which caused military weakness, as the standing army was reduced to as few as 80 men.[71] They considered it to be bad that there was no effective federal military crackdown on an armed tax rebellion in western Massachusetts known as Shays' Rebellion.[72] Anti-federalists on the other hand took the side of limited government and sympathized with the rebels, many of whom were former Revolutionary War soldiers. Subsequently, the Constitutional Convention proposed in 1787 to grant Congress exclusive power to raise and support a standing army and navy of unlimited size.[73][74] Anti-federalists objected to the shift of power from the states to the federal government, but as adoption of the Constitution became more and more likely, they shifted their strategy to establishing a bill of rights that would put some limits on federal power.[75]\nModern scholars Thomas B. McAffee and Michael J. Quinlan have stated that James Madison \"did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment; the right was pre-existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions.\"[76] In contrast, historian Jack Rakove suggests that Madison's intention in framing the Second Amendment was to provide assurances to moderate Anti-Federalists that the militias would not be disarmed.[77]\nOne aspect of the gun control debate is the conflict between gun control laws and the right to rebel against unjust governments. Blackstone in his Commentaries alluded to this right to rebel as the natural right of resistance and self preservation, to be used only as a last resort, exercisable when \"the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression\".[78] Some believe that the framers of the Bill of Rights sought to balance not just political power, but also military power, between the people, the states and the nation,[79] as Alexander Hamilton explained in his Concerning the Militia essay published in 1788:\n... it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defence of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the Government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the People, while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights, and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.[79][80]\nSome scholars have said that it is wrong to read a right of armed insurrection in the Second Amendment because clearly the founding fathers sought to place trust in the power of the ordered liberty of democratic government versus the anarchy of insurrectionists.[81][82] Other writers, such as Glenn Reynolds, contend that the framers did believe in an individual right to armed insurrection. They cite examples, such as the Declaration of Independence (describing in 1776 \"the Right of the People to...institute new Government\") and the Constitution of New Hampshire (stating in 1784 that \"nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind\").[83]\nThere was an ongoing debate beginning in 1789 about \"the people\" fighting governmental tyranny (as described by Anti-Federalists); or the risk of mob rule of \"the people\" (as described by the Federalists) related to the increasingly violent French Revolution.[84] A widespread fear, during the debates on ratifying the Constitution, was the possibility of a military takeover of the states by the federal government, which could happen if the Congress passed laws prohibiting states from arming citizens,[85] or prohibiting citizens from arming themselves.[69] Though it has been argued that the states lost the power to arm their citizens when the power to arm the militia was transferred from the states to the federal government by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the individual right to arm was retained and strengthened by the Militia Acts of 1792 and the similar act of 1795.[86][87]\nIn March 1785, delegates from Virginia and Maryland assembled at the Mount Vernon Conference to fashion a remedy to the inefficiencies of the Articles of Confederation. The following year, at a meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, 12 delegates from five states (New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:[91][92]\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing army.[93] Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:[94]\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia.[95] Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army.[96][97] Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.[98] The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification.[99] James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8, 1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.\nThe debate surrounding the Constitution's ratification is of practical importance, particularly to adherents of originalist and strict constructionist legal theories. In the context of such legal theories and elsewhere, it is important to understand the language of the Constitution in terms of what that language meant to the people who wrote and ratified the Constitution.[100]\nThe Second Amendment was relatively uncontroversial at the time of its ratification.[101] Robert Whitehill, a delegate from Pennsylvania, sought to clarify the draft Constitution with a bill of rights explicitly granting individuals the right to hunt on their own land in season,[102] though Whitehill's language was never debated.[103]\nThere was substantial opposition to the new Constitution, because it moved the power to arm the state militias from the states to the federal government. This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states:\nIn contrast, Article I, Section 8, Clause 16 of the U.S. Constitution states:\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"[107] Noah Webster similarly argued:\nGeorge Mason also argued the importance of the militia and right to bear arms by reminding his compatriots of England's efforts \"to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them ... by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\" He also clarified that under prevailing practice the militia included all people, rich and poor. \"Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\" Because all were members of the militia, all enjoyed the right to individually bear arms to serve therein.[9][109]\nWriting after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the election of the first Congress, James Monroe included \"the right to keep and bear arms\" in a list of basic \"human rights\", which he proposed to be added to the Constitution.[110]\nPatrick Henry argued in the Virginia ratification convention on June 5, 1788, for the dual rights to arms and resistance to oppression:\nAccording to Thom Hartmann, the Virginians James Madison, Patrick Henry, and George Mason were concerned that \"slave patrols,\" organized groups of white men who enforced discipline upon enslaved African Americans, needed to remain armed and, therefore, the Constitution needed to clarify that states have the right to organize white men in such militias.[112] Also, Patrick Henry argued against the ratification of both the Constitution and the Second Amendment.[66] Most Southern white men age 18-45 were required to serve on such patrols. For example, Georgia law required the slave patrol militia, led by commissioned militia officers, to visit each plantation each month, to inspect slave dwellings for weapons and to apprehend and punish slaves who were found off premises.[113] Patrick Henry formulated his concern that: \"If there should happen an insurrection of slaves, the country cannot be said to be invaded. They cannot, therefore, suppress it without the interposition of Congress...Congress, and Congress only [under the Constitution without a Second Amendment], can call forth the militia.\"[114]\nLegal historian Paul Finkelman disputes Hartmann's claim that the Second Amendment was adopted to protect slave patrols, arguing that Hartmann's claim is \"factually incorrect and misleading\" and that there is no historical evidence for this assertion.[66]\nJames Madison's initial proposal for a bill of rights was brought to the floor of the House of Representatives on June 8, 1789, during the first session of Congress. The initial proposed passage relating to arms was:\nThe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.[115]\nOn July 21, Madison again raised the issue of his bill and proposed a select committee be created to report on it. The House voted in favor of Madison's motion,[116] and the Bill of Rights entered committee for review. The committee returned to the House a reworded version of the Second Amendment on July 28.[117] On August 17, that version was read into the Journal:\nA well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.[118]\nIn late August 1789, the House debated and modified the Second Amendment. These debates revolved primarily around risk of \"mal-administration of the government\" using the \"religiously scrupulous\" clause to destroy the militia as Great Britain had attempted to destroy the militia at the commencement of the American Revolution. These concerns were addressed by modifying the final clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the Senate:\nA well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.\nThe next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the House and entered it into the Senate Journal. However, the Senate scribe added a comma before \"shall not be infringed\" and changed the semicolon separating that phrase from the religious exemption portion to a comma:\nA well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed, but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.[119]\nBy this time, the proposed right to keep and bear arms was in a separate amendment, instead of being in a single amendment together with other proposed rights such as the due process right. As a Representative explained, this change allowed each amendment to \"be passed upon distinctly by the States.\"[120] On September 4, the Senate voted to change the language of the Second Amendment by removing the definition of militia, and striking the conscientious objector clause:\nA well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.[121]\nThe Senate returned to this amendment for a final time on September 9. A proposal to insert the words \"for the common defence\" next to the words \"bear arms\" was defeated. A motion passed to replace the words \"the best,\" and insert in lieu there of \"necessary to the\" .[122] The Senate then slightly modified the language to read as the fourth article and voted to return the Bill of Rights to the House. The final version by the Senate was amended to read as:\nA well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\nThe House voted on September 21, 1789 to accept the changes made by the Senate.\nThe enrolled original Joint Resolution passed by Congress on September 25, 1789, on permanent display in the Rotunda, reads as:\nA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\nOn December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was adopted, having been ratified by three-fourths of the states, having been ratified as a group by all the fourteen states then in existence except Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Georgia - which added ratifications in 1939; Vermont ratified them all. [124]\nDuring the first two decades following the ratification of the Second Amendment, public opposition to standing armies, among Anti-Federalists and Federalists alike, persisted and manifested itself locally as a general reluctance to create a professional armed police force, instead relying on county sheriffs, constables and night watchmen to enforce local ordinances.[68] Though sometimes compensated, often these positions were unpaid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c held as a matter of civic duty. In these early decades, law enforcement officers were rarely armed with firearms, using billy clubs as their sole defensive weapons.[68] In serious emergencies, a posse comitatus, militia company, or group of vigilantes assumed law enforcement duties; these individuals were more likely than the local sheriff to be armed with firearms.[68] On May 8, 1792, Congress passed \"[a]n act more effectually to provide for the National Defence, by establishing an Uniform Militia throughout the United States\" requiring:\n[E]ach and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia...[and] every citizen so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball: or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder; and shall appear, so armed, accoutred and provided, when called out to exercise, or into service, except, that when called out on company days to exercise only, he may appear without a knapsack.[125]\nThe act also gave specific instructions to domestic weapon manufacturers \"that from and after five years from the passing of this act, muskets for arming the militia as herein required, shall be of bores sufficient for balls of the eighteenth part of a pound.\"[125] In practice, private acquisition and maintenance of rifles and muskets meeting specifications and readily available for militia duty proved problematic; estimates of compliance ranged from 10 to 65 percent.[126] Compliance with the enrollment provisions was also poor. In addition to the exemptions granted by the law for custom-house officers and their clerks, post-officers and stage drivers employed in the care and conveyance of U.S. mail, ferrymen, export inspectors, pilots, merchant mariners and those deployed at sea in active service; state legislatures granted numerous exemptions under Section 2 of the Act, including exemptions for: clergy, conscientious objectors, teachers, students, and jurors. And though a number of able-bodied white men remained available for service, many simply did not show up for militia duty. Penalties for failure to appear were enforced sporadically and selectively.[127] None is mentioned in the legislation.[125]\nThe first test of the militia system occurred in July 1794, when a group of disaffected Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against federal tax collectors whom they viewed as illegitimate tools of tyrannical power.[128] Attempts by the four adjoining states to raise a militia for nationalization to suppress the insurrection proved inadequate. When officials resorted to drafting men, they faced bitter resistance. Forthcoming soldiers consisted primarily of draftees or paid substitutes as well as poor enlistees lured by enlistment bonuses. The officers, however, were of a higher quality, responding out of a sense of civic duty and patriotism, and generally critical of the rank and file.[68] Most of the 13,000 soldiers lacked the required weaponry; the war department provided nearly two-thirds of them with guns.[68] In October, President George Washington and General Harry Lee marched on the 7,000 rebels who conceded without fighting. The episode provoked criticism of the citizen militia and inspired calls for a universal militia. Secretary of War Henry Knox and Vice-President John Adams had lobbied Congress to establish federal armories to stock imported weapons and encourage domestic production.[68] Congress did subsequently pass \"[a]n act for the erecting and repairing of Arsenals and Magazines\" on April 2, 1794, two months prior to the insurrection.[129] Nevertheless, the militia continued to deteriorate and twenty years later, the militia's poor condition contributed to several losses in the War of 1812, including the sacking of Washington, D.C., and the burning of the White House in 1814.[127]\nIn May of 1788, Richard Henry Lee wrote in Additional Letters From The Federal Farmer #169 or Letter XVIII regarding the definition of a \"militia\":\nA militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary.\nIn June of 1788, George Mason addressed the Virginia Ratifying Convention regarding a \"militia:\"\nA worthy member has asked, who are the militia, if they be not the people, of this country, and if we are not to be protected from the fate of the Germans, Prussians, &c. by our representation? I ask who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers. But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day. If that paper on the table gets no alteration, the militia of the future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor; but may be confined to the lower and middle classes of the people, granting exclusion to the higher classes of the people. If we should ever see that day, the most ignominious punishments and heavy fines may be expected. Under the present government all ranks of people are subject to militia duty.\nIn 1792, Tench Coxe made the following point in a commentary on the Second Amendment:[130]\nAs civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.[131][132]\nThe earliest published commentary on the Second Amendment by a major constitutional theorist was by St. George Tucker. He annotated a five-volume edition of Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, a critical legal reference for early American attorneys published in 1803.[133] Tucker wrote:\nA well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep, and bear arms, shall not be infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4. This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty ... The right of self defence is the first law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game\u00c2\u00a0: a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game. So that not one man in five hundred can keep a gun in his house without being subject to a penalty.[134]\nIn footnotes 40 and 41 of the Commentaries, Tucker stated that the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment was not subject to the restrictions that were part of English law: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.\u00c2\u00a0412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"[133] Blackstone discussed the right of self-defense in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes. Tucker's annotations for that latter section did not mention the Second Amendment but cited the standard works of English jurists such as Hawkins.[135]\nFurther, Tucker criticized the English Bill of Rights for limiting gun ownership to the very wealthy, leaving the populace effectively disarmed, and expressed the hope that Americans \"never cease to regard the right of keeping and bearing arms as the surest pledge of their liberty.\"[133]\nTucker's commentary was soon followed, in 1825, by that of William Rawle in his landmark text, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America. Like Tucker, Rawle condemned England's \"arbitrary code for the preservation of game,\" portraying that country as one that \"boasts so much of its freedom,\" yet provides a right to \"protestant subjects only\" that it \"cautiously describ[es] to be that of bearing arms for their defence\" and reserves for \"[a] very small proportion of the people[.]\"[136] In contrast, Rawle characterizes the second clause of the Second Amendment, which he calls the corollary clause, as a general prohibition against such capricious abuse of government power, declaring bluntly:\nNo clause could by any rule of construction be conceived to give to congress a power to disarm the people. Such a flagitious attempt could only be made under some general pretence by a state legislature. But if in any blind pursuit of inordinate power, either should attempt it, this amendment may be appealed to as a restraint on both.[137]\nSpeaking of the Second Amendment generally, Rawle said:[138]\nThe prohibition is general. No clause in the Constitution could by any rule of construction be conceived to give to congress a power to disarm the people. Such a flagitious attempt could only be made under some general pretence by a state legislature. But if in any blind pursuit of inordinate power, either should attempt it, this amendment may be appealed to as a restraint on both.[138][139]\nRawle, long before the concept of incorporation was formally recognized by the courts, or Congress drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, contended that citizens could appeal to the Second Amendment should either the state or federal government attempt to disarm them. He did warn, however, that \"this right [to bear arms] ought not...be abused to the disturbance of the public peace\" and, paraphrasing Coke, observed: \"An assemblage of persons with arms, for unlawful purpose, is an indictable offence, and even the carrying of arms abroad by a single individual, attended with circumstances giving just reason to fear that he purposes to make an unlawful use of them, would be sufficient cause to require him to give surety of the peace.\"[136]\nJoseph Story articulated in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution[140] the orthodox view of the Second Amendment, which he viewed as the amendment's clear meaning:\nThe right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and it will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well-regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of its burdens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our National Bill of Rights.[141][142]\nStory describes a militia as the \"natural defence of a free country,\" both against foreign foes, domestic revolts and usurpation by rulers. The book regards the militia as a \"moral check\" against both usurpation and the arbitrary use of power, while expressing distress at the growing indifference of the American people to maintaining such an organized militia, which could lead to the undermining of the protection of the Second Amendment.[142]\nAbolitionist Lysander Spooner, commenting on bills of rights, stated that the object of all bills of rights is to assert the rights of individuals against the government and that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms was in support of the right to resist government oppression, as the only security against the tyranny of government lies in forcible resistance to injustice, for injustice will certainly be executed, unless forcibly resisted.[143] Spooner's theory provided the intellectual foundation for John Brown and other radical abolitionists who believed that arming slaves was not only morally justified, but entirely consistent with the Second Amendment.[144] An express connection between this right and the Second Amendment was drawn by Lysander Spooner who commented that a \"right of resistance\" is protected by both the right to trial by jury and the Second Amendment.[145]\nThe congressional debate on the proposed Fourteenth Amendment concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly freed slaves, including disarming the former slaves.[146]\nIn 1867, Judge Timothy Farrar published his Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America, which was written when the Fourteenth Amendment was \"in the process of adoption by the State legislatures.\":[132][147]\nThe States are recognized as governments, and, when their own constitutions permit, may do as they please; provided they do not interfere with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or with the civil or natural rights of the people recognized thereby, and held in conformity to them. The right of every person to \"life, liberty, and property,\" to \"keep and bear arms,\" to the \"writ of habeas corpus\" to \"trial by jury,\" and divers others, are recognized by, and held under, the Constitution of the United States, and cannot be infringed by individuals or even by the government itself.\nJudge Thomas M. Cooley, perhaps the most widely read constitutional scholar of the nineteenth century, wrote extensively about this amendment,[148][149] and he explained in 1880 how the Second Amendment protected the \"right of the people\":\nIt might be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent. The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose.[150]\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, there was considerable debate over whether the Second Amendment protected an individual right or a collective right.[151] The debate centered on whether the prefatory clause (\"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State\") declared the amendment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only purpose or merely announced a purpose to introduce the operative clause (\"the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\"). Scholars advanced three competing theoretical models for how the prefatory clause should be interpreted.[152]\nThe first, known as the \"states' rights\" or \"collective right\" model, held that the Second Amendment does not apply to individuals; rather, it recognizes the right of each state to arm its militia. Under this approach, citizens \"have no right to keep or bear arms, but the states have a collective right to have the National Guard\".[132] Advocates of collective rights models argued that the Second Amendment was written to prevent the federal government from disarming state militias, rather than to secure an individual right to possess firearms.[153] Prior to 2001, every circuit court decision that interpreted the Second Amendment endorsed the \"collective right\" model.[154][155] However, beginning with the Fifth Circuit's opinion United States v. Emerson in 2001, some circuit courts recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.[156]\nThe second, known as the \"sophisticated collective right model\", held that the Second Amendment recognizes some limited individual right. However, this individual right could only be exercised by actively participating members of a functioning, organized state militia.[157][158] Some scholars have argued that the \"sophisticated collective rights model\" is, in fact, the functional equivalent of the \"collective rights model.\"[159] Other commentators have observed that prior to Emerson, five circuit courts specifically endorsed the \"sophisticated collective right model\".[160]\nThe third, known as the \"standard model\", held that the Second Amendment recognized the personal right of individuals to keep and bear arms.[132] Supporters of this model argued that \"although the first clause may describe a general purpose for the amendment, the second clause is controlling and therefore the amendment confers an individual right 'of the people' to keep and bear arms\".[161] Additionally, scholars who favored this model argued the \"absence of founding-era militias mentioned in the Amendment's preamble does not render it a 'dead letter' because the preamble is a 'philosophical declaration' safeguarding militias and is but one of multiple 'civic purposes' for which the Amendment was enacted\".[162]\nUnder both of the collective right models, the opening phrase was considered essential as a pre-condition for the main clause.[163] These interpretations held that this was a grammar structure that was common during that era[164] and that this grammar dictated that the Second Amendment protected a collective right to firearms to the extent necessary for militia duty.[165] However, under the standard model, the opening phrase was believed to be prefatory or amplifying to the operative clause. The opening phrase was meant as a non-exclusive example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of many reasons for the amendment.[47] This interpretation is consistent with the position that the Second Amendment protects a modified individual right.[166]\nThe question of a collective right versus an individual right was progressively resolved in favor of the individual rights model, beginning with the Fifth Circuit ruling in United States v. Emerson (2001), along with the Supreme Court's rulings in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), and McDonald v. Chicago (2010). In Heller, the Supreme Court resolved any remaining circuit splits by ruling that the Second Amendment protects an individual right.[167] Although the Second Amendment is the only Constitutional amendment with a prefatory clause, such linguistic constructions were widely used elsewhere in the late eighteenth century.[168]\nThe term \"regulated\" means \"disciplined\" or \"trained\".[169] In Heller, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.\"[170]\nIn the year prior to the drafting of the Second Amendment, in Federalist No. 29 Alexander Hamilton wrote the following about \"organizing\", \"disciplining\", \"arming\", and \"training\" of the militia as specified in the enumerated powers:\nIf a well regulated militia be the most natural defence of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security ... confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority ... [but] reserving to the states ... the authority of training the militia ... A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss ... Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the People at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.[80]\nJustice Scalia, writing for the Court in Heller: \"In Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243, 251 (1846), the Georgia Supreme Court construed the Second Amendment as protecting the 'natural right of self-defence' and therefore struck down a ban on carrying pistols openly. Its opinion perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory clause, in continuity with the English right\":\nNor is the right involved in this discussion less comprehensive or valuable: \"The right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed.\" The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, reestablished by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta! And Lexington, Concord, Camden, River Raisin, Sandusky, and the laurel-crowned field of New Orleans, plead eloquently for this interpretation! And the acquisition of Texas may be considered the full fruits of this great constitutional right.[171]\nJustice Stevens in dissent:\nWhen each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia. So far as appears, no more than that was contemplated by its drafters or is encompassed within its terms. Even if the meaning of the text were genuinely susceptible to more than one interpretation, the burden would remain on those advocating a departure from the purpose identified in the preamble and from settled law to come forward with persuasive new arguments or evidence. The textual analysis offered by respondent and embraced by the Court falls far short of sustaining that heavy burden. And the Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emphatic reliance on the claim \"that the Second Amendment ... codified a pre-existing right,\" ante, at 19 [refers to p. 19 of the opinion], is of course beside the point because the right to keep and bear arms for service in a state militia was also a pre-existing right.[172]\nJustice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in Heller, stated:\nNowhere else in the Constitution does a \"right\" attributed to \"the people\" refer to anything other than an individual right. What is more, in all six other provisions of the Constitution that mention \"the people,\" the term unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset. This contrasts markedly with the phrase \"the militia\" in the prefatory clause. As we will describe below, the \"militia\" in colonial America consisted of a subset of \"the people\" \u2013 those who were male, able bodied, and within a certain age range. Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right to \"keep and bear Arms\" in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause\u2019s description of the holder of that right as \"the people\".[173]\nAn earlier case, United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990), dealt with nonresident aliens and the Fourth Amendment, but led to a discussion of who are \"the People\" when referred to elsewhere in the Constitution:[174]\nThe Second Amendment protects \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\" and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained by and reserved to \"the people\" ... While this textual exegesis is by no means conclusive, it suggests that \"the people\" protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\nAccording to the majority in Heller, there were several different reasons for this amendment, and protecting militias was only one of them; if protecting militias had been the only reason then the amendment could have instead referred to \"the right of the militia to keep and bear arms\" instead of \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\".[175][176]\nIn Heller the majority rejected the view that the term \"to bear arms\" implies only the military use of arms:\nBefore addressing the verbs \"keep\" and \"bear,\" we interpret their object: \"Arms.\" The term was applied, then as now, to weapons that were not specifically designed for military use and were not employed in a military capacity. Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against,\". Every example given by petitioners\u2019 amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\"[173]\nIn a dissent, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, Justice Stevens said:\nThe Amendment's text does justify a different limitation: the \"right to keep and bear arms\" protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia. Had the Framers wished to expand the meaning of the phrase \"bear arms\" to encompass civilian possession and use, they could have done so by the addition of phrases such as \"for the defense of themselves\".[177]\nIn the century following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times.[178] The vast majority of regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A notable exception to this general rule was Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. 1 (1820), where the U.S. Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an aside.[179] In the Dred Scott decision (1857), the opinion of the court stated that if African Americans were considered U.S. citizens, \"It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry arms wherever they went.\"[180]\nState and federal courts historically have used two models to interpret the Second Amendment: the \"individual rights\" model, which holds that individuals hold the right to bear arms, and the \"collective rights\" model, which holds that the right is dependent on militia membership. The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include United States v. Miller, (1939); District of Columbia v. Heller (2008); and McDonald v. Chicago (2010).\nHeller and McDonald supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in Miller said:\nThe signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.[181]\nOf the collective rights model that holds that the right to arms is based on militia membership, the Supreme Court in Heller said:\nA purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass (except, apparently, in some courses on Linguistics). If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the mad hatter.[182]\nIn the Reconstruction Era case of United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1875), the defendants were white men who had killed more than sixty black people in what was known as the Colfax massacre and had been charged with conspiring to prevent blacks from exercising their right to bear arms. The Court dismissed the charges, holding that the Bill of Rights restricted Congress but not private individuals. The Court concluded, \"[f]or their protection in its enjoyment, the people must look to the States.\"[183]\nThe Court stated that \"[t]he Second Amendment...has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government ......\"[184] Likewise, the Court held that there was no state action in this case, and therefore the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable:\nThe fourteenth amendment prohibits a State from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; but this adds nothing to the rights of one citizen as against another.[185]\nThus, the Court held a federal anti-Ku-Klux-Klan statute to be unconstitutional as applied in that case.[186]\nIn Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886), Herman Presser headed a German-American paramilitary shooting organization and was arrested for leading a parade group of 400 men, training and drilling with military weapons with the declared intention to fight, through the streets of Chicago as a violation of Illinois law that prohibited public drilling and parading in military style without a permit from the governor.[68][187]\nAt his trial, Presser argued that the State of Illinois had violated his Second Amendment rights. The Supreme Court reaffirmed Cruikshank, and also held that the Second Amendment prevented neither the States nor Congress from barring private militias that parade with arms; such a right \"cannot be claimed as a right independent of law.\" This decision upheld the States' authority to regulate the militia and that citizens had no right to create their own militias or to own weapons for semi-military purposes.[68] However the court said: \"A state cannot prohibit the people therein from keeping and bearing arms to an extent that would deprive the United States of the protection afforded by them as a reserve military force.\"[188]\nIn Miller v. Texas, 153 U.S. 535 (1894), Franklin Miller was convicted and sentenced to be executed for shooting a police officer to death with an illegally carried handgun in violation of Texas law. Miller sought to have his conviction overturned, claiming his Second Amendment rights were violated and that the Bill of Rights should be applied to state law. The Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not apply to state laws such as the Texas law:[68] \"As the proceedings were conducted under the ordinary forms of criminal prosecutions there certainly was no denial of due process of law.\"[189]\nIn Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275 (1897), the Court stated in dicta that laws regulating concealed arms did not infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms and thus were not a violation of the Second Amendment:\nThe law is perfectly well settled that the first ten amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the \"Bill of Rights,\" were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guaranties and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors, and which had, from time immemorial, been subject to certain well recognized exceptions arising from the necessities of the case. In incorporating these principles into the fundamental law, there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions, which continued to be recognized as if they had been formally expressed. Thus, the freedom of speech and of the press (Art. I) does not permit the publication of libels, blasphemous or indecent articles, or other publications injurious to public morals or private reputation; the right of the people to keep and bear arms (Art. II) is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.[190]\nIn United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), the Supreme Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered Title II weapons:\nJack Miller and Frank Layton \"did unlawfully ... transport in interstate commerce from ... Claremore ... Oklahoma to ... Siloam Springs ... Arkansas a certain firearm ... a double barrel ... shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length ... at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commerce ... not having registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26, United States Code ... and not having in their possession a stamp-affixed written order ... as provided by Section 1132C ...\"[191]\nIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice McReynolds, the Supreme Court stated \"the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable.\"[192] As the Court explained:\nIn the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.[193]\nGun rights advocates claim that the Court in Miller ruled that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of \"ordinary military equipment.\"[194] They also claim that the Court did not consider the question of whether the sawed-off shotgun in the case would be an applicable weapon for personal defense, instead looking solely at the weapon's suitability for the \"common defense.\"[195] Law professor Andrew McClurg states, \"The only certainty about Miller is that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern scholars recognize this fact.\"[196]\nAccording to the syllabus prepared by the U.S. Supreme Court Reporter of Decisions,[197] in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court held:[197][198]\nThere are similar legal summaries of the Supreme Court's findings in Heller.[199][200][201][202][203][204] For example, the Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Aguilar (2013), summed up Heller's findings and reasoning:\nIn District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court undertook its first-ever \"in-depth examination\" of the second amendment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meaning Id. at 635. After a lengthy historical discussion, the Court ultimately concluded that the second amendment \"guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation\" (id. at 592); that \"central to\" this right is \"the inherent right of self-defense\" (id. at 628); that \"the home\" is \"where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\" (id. at 628); and that, \"above all other interests,\" the second amendment elevates \"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\" (id. at 635). Based on this understanding, the Court held that a District of Columbia law banning handgun possession in the home violated the second amendment. Id. at 635.[205]\nHeller has been widely described as a landmark decision.[206][207][208][209][210] To clarify that its ruling does not invalidate a broad range of existing firearm laws, the majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said:[211]\nLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited ... Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.[212]\nThe Court's statement that the right is limited has been widely discussed by lower courts and the media.[213][214][215][216][217] The majority opinion also said that the amendment's prefatory clause (referencing the \"militia\") serves to clarify the operative clause (referencing \"the people\"), but does not limit the scope of the operative clause, because \"the 'militia' in colonial America consisted of a subset of 'the people'....\"[218]\nJustice Stevens' dissenting opinion, which was joined by the three other dissenters, said:\nThe question presented by this case is not whether the Second Amendment protects a \"collective right\" or an \"individual right.\" Surely it protects a right that can be enforced by individuals. But a conclusion that the Second Amendment protects an individual right does not tell us anything about the scope of that right.[219]\nStevens went on to say the following:\nThe Second Amendment was adopted to protect the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia. It was a response to concerns raised during the ratification of the Constitution that the power of Congress to disarm the state militias and create a national standing army posed an intolerable threat to the sovereignty of the several States. Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limiting any legislature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms. Specifically, there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.[220]\nThis dissent called the majority opinion \"strained and unpersuasive\" and said that the right to possess a firearm exists only in relation to the militia and that the D.C. laws constitute permissible regulation. In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens' interpretation of the phrase \"to keep and bear arms\" was referred to as a \"hybrid\" definition that Stevens purportedly chose in order to avoid an \"incoherent\" and \"[g]rotesque\" idiomatic meeting.[220]\nJustice Breyer, in his own dissent joined by Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, stated that the entire Court subscribes to the proposition that \"the amendment protects an 'individual' right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., one that is separately possessed, and may be separately enforced, by each person on whom it is conferred\".[221]\nRegarding the term \"well regulated\", the majority opinion said, \"The adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.\"[170] The majority opinion quoted Spooner from The Unconstitutionality of Slavery as saying that the right to bear arms was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand against slavery.[222] The majority opinion also stated that:\nA purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass (except, apparently, in some courses on Linguistics). If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the mad hatter.[223]\nThe dissenting justices were not persuaded by this argument.[224]\nReaction to Heller has varied, with many sources giving focus to the ruling referring to itself as being the first in Supreme Court history to read the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, gives explanation of the majority legal reasoning behind this decision.[198] The majority opinion made clear that the recent ruling did not foreclose the Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prior interpretations given in United States v. Cruikshank, Presser v. Illinois, and United States v. Miller though these earlier rulings did not limit the right to keep and bear arms solely to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia (i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes).[198]\nHeller pertained to three District of Columbia ordinances involving restrictions on firearms amounting to a total ban. These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\nUnder any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster.... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"[198]\nJustice Ginsburg has been a vocal critic of Heller. Speaking in an interview on public radio station WNYC, she called the Second Amendment \"outdated,\" saying:\nWhen we no longer need people to keep muskets in their home, then the Second Amendment has no function ... If the Court had properly interpreted the Second Amendment, the Court would have said that amendment was very important when the nation was new; it gave a qualified right to keep and bear arms, but it was for one purpose only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that was the purpose of having militiamen who were able to fight to preserve the nation.[225]\nOn June 28, 2010, the Court in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 3025 (2010), held that the Second Amendment was incorporated, saying that \"[i]t is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.\"[226] This means that the Court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government.[16] It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun prohibition. Four of the five Justices in the majority voted to do so by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while the fifth Justice, Clarence Thomas, voted to do so through the amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause.[227]\nJustice Thomas noted that the Privileges or Immunities Clause refers to \"citizens\" whereas the Due Process Clause refers more broadly to any \"person\", and therefore Thomas reserved the issue of non-citizens for later decision.[228] After McDonald, many questions about the Second Amendment remain unsettled, such as whether non-citizens are protected through the Equal Protection Clause.[228]\nIn People v. Aguilar (2013), the Illinois Supreme Court summed up the central Second Amendment findings in McDonald:\nTwo years later, in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 3020, 3050 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the second amendment right recognized in Heller is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. In so holding, the Court reiterated that \"the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense\" (id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3026); that \"individual self-defense is \u2018the central component\u2019 of the Second Amendment right\" (emphasis in original) (id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3036 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 599)); and that \"[s]elf-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day\" (id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 3036).[205]\nOn March 21, 2016, in a per curiam decision the Court vacated a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision upholding the conviction of a woman who carried a stun gun for self defense. The Court reiterated that the Heller and McDonald decisions saying that \"the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\", that \"the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States\", and that the protection is not restricted to \"only those weapons useful in warfare\".[17][229]\nUntil District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), United States v. Miller (1939) had been the only Supreme Court decision that \"tested a congressional enactment against [the Second Amendment].\"[230] Miller did not directly mention either a collective or individual right, but for the 62-year period from Miller until the Fifth Circuit's decision in United States v. Emerson (2001), federal courts recognized only the collective right,[231] with \"courts increasingly referring to one another's holdings...without engaging in any appreciably substantive legal analysis of the issue\".[230]\nEmerson changed this by addressing the question in depth, with the Fifth Circuit determining that the Second Amendment protects an individual right.[230] Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit conflicted with Emerson in Silveira v. Lockyer, and the D.C. Circuit supported Emerson in Parker v. District of Columbia.[230] Parker evolved into District of Columbia v. Heller, in which the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Second Amendment protects an individual right.\nSince Heller, the United States courts of appeals have ruled on many Second Amendment challenges to convictions and gun control laws.[232][233] The following are post-Heller cases, divided by Circuit, along with summary notes:\nOn June 27, 2008, a day after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Chicago Tribune wrote in an editorial that the Second Amendment should be repealed so local governments could ban firearms in an effort to protect their residents.[273]\nOn October 5, 2017, political commentator Bret Stephens called for the repeal of the Second Amendment, arguing that repeal is the only effective way to regulate firearms.[274]\nOn March 27, 2018, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said the Second Amendment should be repealed. Stevens said that Heller went against the settled understanding of the Second Amendment as being militia-based and that overruling that decision by repealing the Second Amendment would be \"simple.\"[275] President Trump responded the next day to Stevens's call for repeal by saying that it would never happen.[276] Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, says that Stevens's comments were \"staggeringly misplaced\" and could set back demands for gun control. She also said an attempt at repeal would be \"a daunting task\" likely to fail.[277]",

The home of the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) and Atlanta United FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), it replaced the adjacent Georgia Dome, the Falcons' home stadium for a quarter century, from 1992 through 2016.\nOpened in 2017, Mercedes-Benz Stadium is owned by the state of Georgia through the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, and operated by AMB Group, the parent organization of the Falcons and Atlanta United. The total cost is estimated at $1.6 billion, as of June 2016.[15] The stadium officially opened on August 26 with a Falcons preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals, despite the retractable roof system being incomplete.[16][17]\nIn May 2010, it was reported by multiple news outlets that the Atlanta Falcons were interested in demolishing the Georgia Dome and replacing it with a newly constructed open-air stadium.[18][19][20] The team was pursuing a new stadium because of the team's desire to play outdoors, as well as Falcons team owner Arthur Blank's interest in hosting another Super Bowl.[19] The stadium was also pursued as a possible bid for a venue of an upcoming FIFA World Cup.[21]\nKansas City-based architectural firm Populous released comprehensive plans for the proposed stadium in February 2011.[22] Populous' early cost estimate for the project was $700 million.[23] According to the master plan, the stadium would have a maximum capacity of 71,000, but can expand to 75,000 for special events such as the Super Bowl. It will also feature multiple club levels, suites and exhibition area.[22]\nIn April 2012, Populous released a new price estimate of $947.7 million, which was significantly higher than the previous proposal of $700 million.[24] In April 2012, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that if a deal is reached, the new stadium's construction would be expected to begin in 2014, with the Falcons to begin regular-season play in 2017.[25][26] The proposed location of the new stadium is a large parking lot in Atlanta's Vine City neighborhood, which is less than a mile north of the Georgia Dome's current location.[27] Once construction is complete, the Georgia Dome would subsequently be demolished.[26]\nOn August 24, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that an official deal could be reached on the construction of a new stadium by the end of 2012.[28] They also reported on September 10 that Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed said site improvements could likely bump the total cost to $1.2 billion; however, that does not increase the actual building cost, which still remains at an estimated $948 million.[29]\nOn December 10, the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, in a unanimous decision, approved the blueprint and most of the agreement terms for the new stadium plans. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution article, the term sheet is non-binding and changes could be made at any time as regards stadium construction. Stadium location, however, is yet to be worked out; proposed locations being reported are within walking distance of the Georgia Dome, with one site located one-half mile north, and the other one block directly south, at the one of the stadium's existing parking lots.[30] The project made national headlines for the first time in 2012 on December 15, with team owner Arthur Blank stating in The New York Times that he would rather a new stadium be constructed than a \"remodeling job\" of the Georgia Dome.[31]\nDuring a January 10, 2013 press conference, Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed expressed his optimism and confidence in the construction of the new stadium; he also mentioned the possibility of the new stadium helping the city compete for its first Major League Soccer team.[32]\nOn March 7, 2013, the Atlanta Falcons and the city of Atlanta agreed to build the new downtown stadium. The maximum public contribution for the project is $200 million, coming from the hotel-motel tax in Atlanta and unincorporated Fulton County. The Atlanta City Council officially approved the stadium on March 19, 2013. The council voted, 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4, in favor of the use of city hotel-motel taxes to pay $200 million toward construction costs and potentially several times that toward costs of financing, maintaining and operating the stadium through 2050.[33] On May 21, 2013, the NFL approved a $200 million loan to the Falcons organization for the purpose of building the stadium.[34]\nOn June 18, 2013, it was announced that the Falcons have completed a full conceptual design of the proposed new stadium, and that they have secured the initial approval to proceed with the schematic design phase. According to Doug Farrar's Shutdown Corner, \"The stadium will seat approximately 70,000 people, with 180 luxury suites and 7,500 club seats.\" The main agency involved will be 360 Architecture, partnered with three other architectural firms.[35]\nArthur Blank indicated the groundbreaking of the stadium would be conducted the last week of March 2014.[36][37][38] Just after Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive was closed permanently, the Mount Vernon Baptist Church held its last Sunday service on March 9 before the historic church was demolished. Due to legal issues surrounding the issuing of bonds, the stadium did not break ground in March 2014.[39] Instead the ground was officially broken in a ceremony led by Mayor Kasim Reed on May 19, 2014.[40]\nIn a live broadcast on August 24, 2015, owner Arthur Blank announced that the new title of the stadium would be Mercedes-Benz Stadium. As the New Orleans Saints, the Falcons' archrivals in the NFC South, play in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, this gave the division two stadiums that were sponsored by the same company. A new logo was also introduced. Steve Cannon, then CEO of Mercedes-Benz USA, also spoke at the event about the company's corporate move from New Jersey to Atlanta. Other speakers included Georgia Governor Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.\nThe winning design, submitted by HOK,[41] featured an eight-panel retractable roof that resembled a pinwheel, and a glass wall that would open with the roof to allow in fresh air.[42]\nThe roof design included eight triangular translucent panels, that when opened would create the illusion of a bird's wings extended. Surrounding the opening of the roof would be a halo video board that would enclose the playing surface, stretching from one of the 10-yard lines to the other and then curving around the end zones to complete the oval.[43] Each of the eight panels operates on two parallel rails; one rail is responsible for moving the panel while the other rail stabilizes the panel.[17]\nIn January 2015, the Falcons announced the hiring of Daktronics, a South Dakota-based firm, to build the stadium's electronics display. The announced features included a circular 58-by-1,100-foot (18 by 335\u00a0m) circular LED board that would ring the opening of the stadium's roof, and would be \"three times as large as the current largest single display board in the NFL\" installed at EverBank Field in Jacksonville (also built by Daktronics). In addition, the company installed more than 20,000 square feet (1,900\u00a0m2) of other LED boards, including field-level advertising boards for soccer games.[44]\nThe design included a 100-yard bar that would stretch the length of the football field in the upper concourse, along with a fantasy football lounge and premium club seating at field level, behind the teams' benches.[45]\nThe stadium also incorporated contemporary art into its interior and exterior design, with over 180 specially commissioned works, including pieces by Nari Ward, Hank Willis Thomas, and Steven and William Ladd. The centerpiece of the art collection was to be G\u00e1bor Mikl\u00f3s Sz\u0151ke\u2019s steel sculpture \"Rise Up,\" which the artist claimed would be the largest freestanding bird sculpture in the world. The falcon, perched atop a 13-foot-tall bronze football, is 41 feet high, with a wingspan of 70 feet. The over-73,000-pound artwork, stands in front of the stadium, and as tall as a four-story building. [46]\nArchitect Bill Johnson said the circular opening in the roof was inspired by the Roman Pantheon (\"Pantheon\" was also the working name for the building design). The roof was designed to be made of a clear, lightweight polymer material that can adjust its opacity to control light, and much of the exterior will be clear polymer or glass to allow views to the outside. The middle concourse and upper bowl were eliminated in the east end zone to allow for an unobstructed view of the Atlanta skyline.[42]\nAtlanta United FC General Manager Jim Smith said the design had \"soccer in mind from the very beginning\", pointing to the retracting lower bowl seats to widen the field, and mechanized curtains that limit the capacity to about 42,500 and make the stadium feel more intimate.[47]\nThe stadium features a Chick-fil-A location, a business that famously closes on Sundays, despite its main tenant, the Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location opens when the Falcons have a Monday night or Thursday night home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell non-branded food and drinks at the location[48]\nMercedes-Benz Stadium's projected opening date was delayed three times due to the complexity of the eight-panel retractable roof. The stadium was originally intended to open on March 1, 2017; however, the opening date was later delayed to June 1, 2017, then to July 30, 2017, and then to August 26, 2017. Steve Cannon, CEO of the Atlanta Falcons' parent company AMB Group, stated that the Falcons' preseason schedule and the Chick-fil-a Kickoff Games would not be affected by the new opening date; however, three of Atlanta United's matches would be affected. The July 30 game against Orlando City SC was moved to Atlanta United's interim home of Bobby Dodd Stadium for July 29 while two home matches scheduled in August were moved to later dates. Additionally, the Georgia Dome's demolition was put on hold until the new stadium's certificate of occupancy could be issued.[16] On June 9, 2017, stadium officials announced that they were confident that Mercedes-Benz Stadium would open as scheduled, and demolition of the Georgia Dome had resumed, with the Dome scheduled for implosion on November 20, 2017.[49]\nOn July 25, 2017, stadium officials reported that the roof would be in the closed position during the Falcons' preseason games and the Chick-fil-A Kickoff games while contractors continue to fine tune the roof to allow all eight panels to work in sync. Falcons' President Rich McKay also stated that the roof would remain closed whenever outside temperatures exceed 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C).[50] On August 16, 2017, WXIA reported that construction of the retractable roof system was intentionally delayed by stadium and construction officials to ensure the roof's long term operability and to ensure that other parts of the stadium would be completed on time.[51]\nOn September 10, 2017, the Falcons announced that, contrary to earlier plans, the stadium roof would in fact be open during the Falcons home opener on September 17 against the Green Bay Packers if weather permitted.[52] On October 6, 2017, stadium officials announced that the roof would be opened, weather permitting, for Atlanta United's regular season finale against Toronto FC on October 22; stadium officials also stated that the roof would remain closed for the remainder of the Falcons' regular season as well as for any home matches hosted by Atlanta United during the 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs as contractors continue to work on fully mechanizing the roof.[53]\nIn December 2014, the Georgia World Congress Center's board of governors approved a resolution to raise the cost of the stadium to $1.2 billion. The stadium was initially slated to cost $1 billion, then rose to $1.2 billion in October 2013.[54]\nThe city has agreed to contribute $200 million in stadium bonds, but with additional tax revenues[55] and with the state of Georgia contributing $40 million for parking expansion, public spending is expected to reach near $600 million.[56]\nIn January 2015, the Falcons announced the sale of personal seat licenses (PSL) costing up to $45,000 per seat, depending on the section of the stadium. The most expensive tickets is priced at $385 per game, in addition to one-time PSL fees, for the first three years.[57]\nOn August 21, 2015, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Mercedes-Benz would acquire the naming rights for the stadium, and this was later confirmed by a press conference at the stadium site on August 24. Under the stadium deal with the city of Atlanta and the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, the Falcons organization controls the stadium's naming rights and receives all related revenue. Then-Mercedes-Benz USA CEO Steve Cannon, who would subsequently join the Falcons' organization in 2016 as CEO of AMB Group,[58] stated that the sponsorship would last 27 years, calling it the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz' history, but Cannon would not disclose the full value of the deal. Mercedes-Benz also holds a 10-year naming rights contract for the former Louisiana Superdome signed in 2011.[59]",

        "text": "The French and Indian War (1754\u201363) comprised the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War of 1756\u201363. It pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France. Both sides were supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as by American Indian allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies.[3] The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.\nThe name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States. It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists: the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them. The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois, Catawba, and Cherokee, and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq, and Algonquin, Lenape, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot.\nBritish and other European historians use the term the Seven Years' War, as do English-speaking Canadians.[4] French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqu\u00c3\u00aate (the War of the Conquest)[5][6] or (rarely) the Fourth Intercolonial War.[7][not in citation given]\nFighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol.\nIn 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French. None succeeded, and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755\u201357 due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia, and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians (1755\u201364) soon afterwards. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians were expelled, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty. Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England.[8]\nThe British colonial government fell in the region of modern Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757, including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims. William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France, preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theater of the war. Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada (part of New France). They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec (1759). The British later lost the Battle of Sainte-Foy west of Quebec (1760), but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1763).\nThe outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict. France ceded to Great Britain its territory east of the Mississippi. It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Florida. (Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba.) France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, confirming Great Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America.\nThe conflict is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. There had already been a King George's War in the 1740s during the reign of King George II, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War.[9] This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain.[10] American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.[9]\nIn Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, which was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.[9]\nCanadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years' War (Guerre de Sept Ans).[11][12] French Canadians also use the term \"War of Conquest\" (Guerre de la Conqu\u00c3\u00aate), since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire.\nAt this time, North America east of the Mississippi River was largely claimed by either Great Britain or France. Large areas had no colonial settlements. The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley, with some also in Acadia (present-day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia), including \u00c3\u017dle Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island). Fewer lived in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama, and small settlements in the Illinois Country, hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local Indian tribes, and often married Indian women.[13] Traders married daughters of chiefs, creating high-ranking unions.\nBritish settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1[14] with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north to Georgia in the south.[15] Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west, as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted. Their population centers were along the coast, yet the settlements were growing into the interior. Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713, and it still had a significant French-speaking population. Britain also claimed Rupert's Land where the Hudson's Bay Company traded for furs with local Indian tribes.\nIn between the French and British colonists, large areas were dominated by Indian tribes. To the north, the Mi'kmaqs and the Abenakis were engaged in Father Le Loutre's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and the eastern portions of the province of Canada, as well as much of Maine.[16] The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of Upstate New York and the Ohio Country, although Ohio also included Algonquian-speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee, as well as Iroquoian-speaking Mingos. These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements.[17]\nThe Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawbas, Muskogee-speaking Creeks and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes.[18] When war broke out, the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region, which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British; these included the Hurons, Mississaugs, Ojibwas, Winnebagos, and Potawatomi. The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and also by the Cherokees, until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758, the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.\nBy this time, Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern North America; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the West Indies that became military objectives in the Seven Years' War. Florida's European population was a few hundred, concentrated in St. Augustine and Pensacola.\nAt the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in North America, and few British troops. New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine, companies of colonial regulars (some of whom had significant woodland combat experience). The colonial government recruited militia support when needed. Most British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, but they did not have any standing forces. Virginia, by contrast, had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars.\nThe colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London, a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes, whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies. After the war began, the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations.\nNew France's Governor-General Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissoni\u00e8re was concerned about the incursion and expanding influence in the Ohio Country of British colonial traders such as George Croghan. In June 1747, he ordered Pierre-Joseph C\u00e9loron to lead a military expedition through the area. Its objectives were:\nC\u00e9loron's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians, and they covered about 3,000 miles (4,800\u00a0km) between June and November 1749. They went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie. At the Chautauqua Portage near Barcelona, New York, the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River, which it followed to the site of Pittsburgh. There C\u00e9loron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.[19] Whenever he encountered British colonial merchants or fur-traders, he informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.[19]\nC\u00e9loron's expedition arrived at Logstown where the Indians in the area informed him that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British colonists regardless of the French.[20] He continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers, which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, the home of the Miami chief known as \"Old Briton\". C\u00e9loron threatened Old Briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with British colonists, but Old Briton ignored the warning. C\u00e9loron returned disappointedly to Montreal in November 1749.[21]\nC\u00c3\u00a9loron wrote an extensively detailed report. \"All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French,\" he wrote, \"and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back.\"[20] Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken. Massachusetts governor William Shirley was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present.[22]\nIn 1749, the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.[23] The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory and construct a fort for their protection. But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims.[24] In 1750, Christopher Gist explored the Ohio territory, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown.[25] He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their \"Half-King\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative. These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the Monongahela River on the modern site of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[26] By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest.\nThe War of the Austrian Succession (better known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission, but it reached no decision. Frontier areas were claimed by both sides, from Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north to the Ohio Country in the south. The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean, where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.\nGovernor-General of New France Marquis de la Jonqui\u00e8re died on March 17, 1752, and he was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. His permanent replacement was to be the Marquis Duquesne, but he did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post.[27] The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa tribe. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following C\u00e9loron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders[21] and killing 14 Miami Indians, including Old Briton. He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some Indians in the expedition party.\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians. His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that C\u00e9loron had mapped out four years earlier. C\u00e9loron, however, had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie's south shore near Erie, Pennsylvania, and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford, Pennsylvania, designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father. He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.[28]\nThe Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York, who was the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond. Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey, meaning \"he who does great things.\" He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area, and he was made a colonel of the Iroquois in 1746; he was later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia.\nThe Indian representatives and Johnson met with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies at Albany, New York. Mohawk Chief Hendrick was the speaker of their tribal council, and he insisted that the British abide by their obligations[which?] and block French expansion. Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, and Hendrick said that the \"Covenant Chain\" was broken, a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown.\nGovernor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company, which stood to lose money if the French held their claim.[29] He ordered 21 year-old Major George Washington (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory in October 1753.[30] Washington left with a small party, picking up Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter, Christopher Gist (a company surveyor working in the area), and a few Mingos led by Tanaghrisson. On December 12, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.[31][32]\nJacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after Marin died on October 29, and he invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, \"As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.\"[33] He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.[34]\nWashington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16 and arrived in Williamsburg on January 16, 1754. He stated in his report, \"The French had swept south\",[35] detailing the steps which they had taken to fortify the area, and their intention to fortify the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.[36]\nEven before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point where they began construction of a small stockaded fort in the early months of 1754.[37] Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrec\u0153ur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrec\u0153ur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754.[38] These forces arrived at the fort on April 16, but Contrec\u0153ur generously allowed Trent's small company to withdraw. He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne.[39]\nDinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work, and Washington learned of Trent's retreat while he was en route.[40] Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him. He then learned of a French scouting party in the area, so he combined Tanaghrisson's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.[41]\nHistorians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America, and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley.\nFollowing the battle, Washington pulled back several miles and established Fort Necessity, which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jummonville's brother at the Battle of Fort Necessity on July 3. Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms. One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by Shawnee, Delaware, and Mingo warriors\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence.[42]\nNews of the two battles reached England in August. After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French.[43] They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition.[44] Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755.[45] The British sent out their fleet in February 1755, intending to blockade French ports, but the French fleet had already sailed. Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them.\nIn a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships.[46] The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756.[47]\nAn early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754. The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding. The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown. Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.\nThe British formed an aggressive plan of operations for 1755. General Braddock was to lead the expedition to Fort Duquesne,[48] while Massachusetts governor William Shirley was given the task of fortifying Fort Oswego and attacking Fort Niagara. Sir William Johnson was to capture Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric at present-day Crown Point, New York,[49] and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton was to capture Fort Beaus\u00e9jour to the east, on the frontier between Nova Scotia and Acadia.[50]\nBraddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne, with George Washington as one of his aides. The expedition was a disaster. It was attacked by French soldiers and Indian warriors ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs, and Braddock called for a retreat. He was killed and approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.[48] The remaining 500 British troops retreated to Virginia, led by Washington. Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War played key roles in organizing the retreat: Washington and Thomas Gage.\nThe French acquired a copy of the British war plans, including the activities of Shirley and Johnson. Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions. In conjunction, Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara. As a response, he left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams, the last two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present-day Rome, New York. Supplies were cached at Fort Bull for use in the projected attack on Niagara.\nJohnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor the Marquis de Vaudreuil. He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and he had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. Vaudreuil saw Johnson as the larger threat and sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).\nColonel Monckton captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour in June 1755 in the sole British success that year, cutting off the French fortress at Louisbourg from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities. More than any other factor, cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise.[51] The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff, in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq, with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg, among others. The only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757, other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and \u00cele Saint-Jean.\nFollowing the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America, and he laid out his plans for 1756 at a meeting in Albany in December 1755. He proposed renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point, and Duquesne, with attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec. His plan, however, got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy, and consequently gained little support.\nNewcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun, with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command. Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers whom France sent to North America.[47] French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756, led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de L\u00e9vis and Colonel Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession. On May 18, 1756, England formally declared war on France, which expanded the war into Europe and came to be known as the Seven Years' War.\nGovernor Vaudreuil had ambitions to become the French commander in chief, in addition to his role as governor, and he acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived. Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts which Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry. In the Battle of Fort Bull, French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder. They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies. French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area, encouraging them to raid frontier settlements. This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers, with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action.\nThe new British command was not in place until July. Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them, and Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. He built on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison and executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.\nLoudoun was a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, and he planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on New France's capital of Quebec. He left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm and began organizing for the expedition to Quebec. He was then ordered to attack Louisbourg first by William Pitt, the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies. The expedition was beset by delays of all kinds but was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August. In the meantime, French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast, and a fleet awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg which outnumbered the British fleet. Faced with this strength, Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry.\nFrench irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. In January, they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. In February, they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were angry about the lost opportunity for loot, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations, as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward. Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers, although no proof exists.[52]\nVaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of Fran\u00e7ois Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle;[53] yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing \"bad medicine\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry.\nMontcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.[54] The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland, his principal military advisor.\nNewcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.\nThe Forbes Expedition was a British campaign in September\u00e2\u20ac\u201cOctober 1758, with 6,000 troops led by General John Forbes sent to drive out the French from the contested Ohio Country. The French withdrew from Fort Duquesne and left the British in control of the Ohio River Valley.[55] The great French fortress at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia was captured after a siege.[56]\nThe third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia, and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst, victor at Louisbourg.\nThe French had generally poor results in 1758 in most theaters of the war. The new foreign minister was the duc de Choiseul, and he decided to focus on an invasion of Britain to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland. The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britain's mainland ally of Prussia, while the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships did manage to depart France and elude the British blockade of the French coast.\nBritish victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759: the British captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders, and a British victory at Fort Niagara cut off the French frontier forts to the west and south. The victory was made complete in 1760; the British did suffer a defeat outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, but they prevented the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides.\nGovernor Vaudreuil in Montreal negotiated a capitulation with General Amherst in September 1760. Amherst granted his requests that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, to own property, and to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers, and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.[57]\nMost of the fighting ended in continental North America in 1760, although it continued in Europe between France and Britain. The notable exception was the French seizure of St. John's, Newfoundland. General Amherst heard of this surprise action and immediately dispatched troops under his nephew William Amherst, who regained control of Newfoundland after the Battle of Signal Hill in September 1762.[58] Many troops from North America were reassigned to participate in further British actions in the West Indies, including the capture of Spanish Havana when Spain belatedly entered the conflict on the side of France, and a British expedition against French Martinique in 1762 led by Major General Robert Monckton.[59]\nGeneral Amherst also oversaw the transition of French forts to British control in the western lands. The policies which he introduced in those lands disturbed large numbers of Indians and contributed to Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763.[60] This series of attacks on frontier forts and settlements required the continued deployment of British troops, and it was not resolved until 1766.[61]\nThe war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763, and war in the European theater was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763. The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue; they also had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba, but they also gained Louisiana from France, including New Orleans, in compensation for their losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.[62]\nThe war changed economic, political, governmental, and social relations among the three European powers, their colonies, and the people who inhabited those territories. France and Britain both suffered financially because of the war, with significant long-term consequences.\nBritain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places such as Saint-Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. (The French word \"Acadien\" changed to \"Cadien\" then to \"Cajun\".)[63]\nFollowing the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population,[64] a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers.[65] The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians.[66] The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774, raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery.\" The Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.\nThe Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt. The Crown sought sources of revenue to pay it off and attempted to impose new taxes on its colonies. These attempts were met with increasingly stiff resistance, until troops were called in to enforce the Crown's authority. These acts ultimately led to the start of the American Revolutionary War.[67]\nFrance attached comparatively little value to its North American possessions, apart from the highly profitable sugar-producing Antilles islands which it retained. Minister Choiseul considered that he had made a good deal at the Treaty of Paris, and Voltaire wrote that Louis XV had lost \"a few acres of snow\".[68] For France, however, the military defeat and the financial burden of the war weakened the monarchy and contributed to the advent of the French Revolution in 1789.[69]\nFor some of the Indian tribes, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally, although other tribes were not so affected.[69] The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement, due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes.[70] The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, and it had modest repercussions. The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not want to do business with them. This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies who were now competing for land.[71] The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.[72]\nFrance returned to North America in 1778 with the establishment of a Franco-American alliance against Great Britain in the American War of Independence. This time, France succeeded in prevailing over Great Britain in what historian Alfred A. Cave describes as \"French\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 revenge for Montcalm's death\".[73]",

[nb 6]\nMediterranean and Middle East\n1942\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1943\n1944\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1945\nThe Battle of Britain (German: Luftschlacht um England, literally \"The Air Battle for England\") was a military campaign of the Second World War, in which the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces.[17]\nThe British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.[18] German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941, including the Blitz.[19]\nThe primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement. In July 1940 the air and sea blockade began, with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys, ports and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth. On 1 August, the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command; 12 days later, it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure.[20] As the battle progressed, the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure. Eventually it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians.[nb 9]\nThe Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries, leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea. The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack[citation needed] and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea.[22] On 16 July, Adolf Hitler ordered the preparation of Operation Sea Lion as a potential amphibious and airborne assault on Britain, to follow once the Luftwaffe had air superiority over the UK. In September, RAF Bomber Command night raids disrupted the German preparation of converted barges, and the Luftwaffe's failure to overwhelm the RAF forced Hitler to postpone and eventually cancel Operation Sea Lion. Germany proved unable to sustain daylight raids, but their continued night-bombing operations on Britain became known as the Blitz.\nHistorian Stephen Bungay cited Germany's failure to destroy Britain's air defences to force an armistice (or even outright surrender) as the first major German defeat in World War II and a crucial turning point in the conflict.[23] The Battle of Britain takes its name from a speech by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on 18 June: \"What General Weygand has called The Battle of France is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin.\"[24]\nStrategic bombing during World War I introduced air attacks intended to panic civilian targets and led in 1918 to the amalgamation of British army and navy air services into the Royal Air Force.[25] Its first Chief of the Air Staff Hugh Trenchard was among the military strategists in the 1920s like Giulio Douhet who saw air warfare as a new way to overcome the stalemate of trench warfare. Interception was nearly impossible with fighter planes no faster than bombers. Their view (expressed vividly in 1932) was that the bomber will always get through, and the only defence was a deterrent bomber force capable of matching retaliation. Predictions were made that a bomber offensive would quickly cause thousands of deaths and civilian hysteria leading to capitulation, but widespread pacifism contributed to a reluctance to provide resources.[26]\nGermany was forbidden to have a military air force by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, but developed air crew training in civilian and sport flying. Following a 1923 memorandum, the Deutsche Luft Hansa airline developed designs which were claimed to be for passengers and freight, but which could in fact be readily adapted into bombers, including the Junkers Ju 52. In 1926 the secret Lipetsk fighter-pilot school began operating.[27] Erhard Milch organised rapid expansion, and following the 1933 Nazi seizure of power his subordinate Robert Knauss formulated a deterrence theory incorporating Douhet's ideas and Tirpitz's \"risk theory\", which proposed a fleet of heavy bombers to deter a preventive attack by France and Poland before Germany could fully rearm.[28] A winter 1933\u201334 war game indicated a need for fighters and anti-aircraft protection as well as bombers. On 1 March 1935 the Luftwaffe was formally announced, with Walther Wever as Chief of Staff. The 1935 Luftwaffe doctrine for \"Conduct of the Air War\" (Die Luftkriegf\u00fchrung) set air power within the overall military strategy, with critical tasks of attaining (local and temporary) air superiority and providing battlefield support for army and naval forces. Strategic bombing of industries and transport could be decisive longer term options, dependent on opportunity or preparations by the army and navy, to overcome a stalemate or used when only destruction of the enemy's economy would be conclusive.[29][30] The list excluded bombing civilians to destroy homes or undermine morale, as that was considered a waste of strategic effort, but the doctrine allowed revenge attacks if German civilians were bombed. A revised edition was issued in 1940, and the continuing central principle of Luftwaffe doctrine was that destruction of enemy armed forces was of primary importance.[31]\nThe RAF responded to Luftwaffe developments with its 1934 Expansion Plan A rearmament scheme, and in 1936 it was restructured into Bomber Command, Coastal Command, Training Command and Fighter Command. The latter was under Hugh Dowding, who opposed the doctrine that bombers were unstoppable: the invention of radar at that time could allow early detection, and prototype monoplane fighters were significantly faster. Priorities were disputed, but in December 1937 the Minister in charge of defence coordination Sir Thomas Inskip decided in Dowding's favour, that \"The role of our air force is not an early knock-out blow\" but rather was \"to prevent the Germans from knocking us out\" and fighter squadrons were just as necessary as bomber squadrons.[32][33]\nIn the Spanish Civil War, the Luftwaffe in the Condor Legion tried out air fighting tactics and their new aeroplanes. Wolfram von Richthofen became an exponent of air power providing ground support to other services.[34] The difficulty of accurately hitting targets prompted Ernst Udet to require that all new bombers had to be dive bombers, and led to the development of the Knickebein system for night time navigation. Priority was given to producing large numbers of smaller aeroplanes, and plans for a long range four engined strategic bomber were delayed.[25][35]\nThe early stages of World War II saw successful German invasions on the continent aided decisively by the air power of the Luftwaffe, which was able to establish tactical air superiority with great efficiency. The speed with which German forces defeated most of the defending armies in Norway in early 1940 created a significant political crisis in Britain. In early May 1940, the Norway Debate questioned the fitness for office of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. On 10 May, the same day Winston Churchill became British Prime Minister, the Germans initiated the Battle of France with an aggressive invasion of French territory. RAF Fighter Command was desperately short of trained pilots and aircraft, but despite the objections of its commander Hugh Dowding that the diversion of his forces would leave home defences under-strength, Churchill sent fighter squadrons, the Air Component of the British Expeditionary Force, to support operations in France,[36] where the RAF suffered heavy losses.[37]\nAfter the evacuation of British and French soldiers from Dunkirk and the French surrender on 22 June 1940, Hitler mainly focused his energies on the possibility of invading the Soviet Union[38] in the belief that the British, defeated on the continent and without European allies, would quickly come to terms.[39] The Germans were so convinced of an imminent armistice that they began constructing street decorations for the homecoming parades of victorious troops.[40] Although the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, and certain elements of the British public favoured a negotiated peace with an ascendant Germany, Churchill and a majority of his Cabinet refused to consider an armistice.[41] Instead, Churchill used his skilful rhetoric to harden public opinion against capitulation and to prepare the British for a long war.\nThe Battle of Britain has the unusual distinction that it gained its name before being fought. The name is derived from the This was their finest hour speech delivered by Winston Churchill in the House of Commons on 18 June, more than three weeks prior to the generally accepted date for the start of the battle:\n... What General Weygand has called The Battle of France is over. The battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British life and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of a perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, \"This was their finest hour\".[24][42][43]\nFrom the outset of his rise to power, Hitler expressed admiration for Britain, and throughout the Battle period he sought neutrality or a peace treaty with Britain.[44] In a secret conference on 23 May 1939, Hitler set out his rather contradictory strategy that an attack on Poland was essential and \"will only be successful if the Western Powers keep out of it. If this is impossible, then it will be better to attack in the West and to settle Poland at the same time\" with a surprise attack. \"If Holland and Belgium are successfully occupied and held, and if France is also defeated, the fundamental conditions for a successful war against England will have been secured. England can then be blockaded from Western France at close quarters by the Air Force, while the Navy with its submarines extend the range of the blockade.\"[45][46]\nWhen war commenced, Hitler and the OKW (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or \"High Command of the Armed Forces\") issued a series of Directives ordering planning and stating strategic objectives. \"Directive No. 1 for the Conduct of the War\" dated 31 August 1939 instructed the invasion of Poland on 1 September as planned. Potentially, Luftwaffe \"operations against England\" were to \"dislocate English imports, the armaments industry, and the transport of troops to France. Any favourable opportunity of an effective attack on concentrated units of the English Navy, particularly on battleships or aircraft carriers, will be exploited. The decision regarding attacks on London is reserved to me. Attacks on the English homeland are to be prepared, bearing in mind that inconclusive results with insufficient forces are to be avoided in all circumstances.\"[47][48] Both France and the UK declared war on Germany; on 9 October Hitler's \"Directive No. 6\" planned the offensive to defeat these allies and \"win as much territory as possible in Holland, Belgium, and northern France to serve as a base for the successful prosecution of the air and sea war against England\".[49] On 29 November OKW \"Directive No. 9 \u2013 Instructions For Warfare Against The Economy Of The Enemy\" stated that once this coastline had been secured, the Luftwaffe together with the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) was to blockade UK ports with sea mines, attack shipping and warships, and make air attacks on shore installations and industrial production. This directive remained in force in the first phase of the Battle of Britain.[50][51] It was reinforced on 24 May during the Battle of France by \"Directive No. 13\" which authorised the Luftwaffe \"to attack the English homeland in the fullest manner, as soon as sufficient forces are available. This attack will be opened by an annihilating reprisal for English attacks on the Ruhr Basin.\"[52]\nBy the end of June 1940, Germany had defeated Britain's allies on the continent, and on 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his review of options to increase pressure on Britain to agree to a negotiated peace. The first priority was to eliminate the RAF and gain air supremacy. Intensified air attacks against shipping and the economy could affect food supplies and civilian morale in the long term. Reprisal attacks of terror bombing had the potential to cause quicker capitulation, but the effect on morale was uncertain. Once the Luftwaffe had control of the air, and the UK economy had been weakened, an invasion would be a last resort or a final strike (\"Todesstoss\") after England had already been conquered, but could have a quick result.[clarification needed] On the same day, the Luftwaffe Commander-in-Chief Hermann G\u00f6ring issued his operational directive; to destroy the RAF, thus protecting German industry, and also to block overseas supplies to Britain.[53][54] The German Supreme Command argued over the practicality of these options.\nIn \"Directive No. 16 \u2013 On preparations for a landing operation against England\" on 16 July,[55] Hitler required readiness by mid-August for the possibility of an invasion he called Operation Sea Lion, unless the British agreed to negotiations. The Luftwaffe reported that it would be ready to launch its major attack early in August. The Kriegsmarine Commander-in-Chief, Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, continued to highlight the impracticality of these plans, and said sea invasion could not take place before the Spring of 1941. Hitler now argued that Britain was holding out in hope of assistance from Russia, and the Soviet Union was to be invaded by mid 1941.[56] G\u00f6ring met his air fleet commanders, and on 24 July issued \"Tasks and Goals\" of firstly gaining air supremacy, secondly protecting invasion forces and attacking the Royal Navy's ships. Thirdly, they were to blockade imports, bombing harbours and stores of supplies.[57]\nHitler's \"Directive No. 17 \u2013 For the conduct of air and sea warfare against England\" issued on 1 August attempted to keep all the options open. The Luftwaffe's Adlertag campaign was to start around 5 August, subject to weather, with the aim of gaining air superiority over southern England as a necessary precondition of invasion, to give credibility to the threat and give Hitler the option of ordering the invasion. The intention was to incapacitate the RAF so much that the UK would feel open to air attack, and would begin peace negotiations. It was also to isolate the UK and damage war production, beginning an effective blockade.[58] Following severe Luftwaffe losses, Hitler agreed at a 14 September OKW conference that the air campaign was to intensify regardless of invasion plans. On 16 September, G\u00f6ring gave the order for this change in strategy,[59] to the first independent strategic bombing campaign.[60]\nAdolf Hitler's Mein Kampf of 1923 mostly set out his hatreds: he only admired ordinary German World War I soldiers and Britain, which he saw as an ally against communism. In 1935 Hermann G\u00f6ring welcomed news that Britain as a potential ally was rearming. In 1936 he promised assistance to defend the British Empire, asking only a free hand in Eastern Europe, and repeated this to Lord Halifax in 1937. That year, von Ribbentrop met Churchill with a similar proposal; when rebuffed, he told Churchill that interference with German domination would mean war. To Hitler's great annoyance, all his diplomacy failed to stop Britain from declaring war when he invaded Poland. During the fall of France, he repeatedly discussed peace efforts with his generals.[44]\nWhen Churchill came to power, there was still wide support for Halifax, who as Foreign Secretary openly argued for peace negotiations in the tradition of British diplomacy, to secure British independence without war. On 20 May, Halifax secretly requested a Swedish businessman to make contact with G\u00f6ring to open negotiations. Shortly afterwards, in the May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, Halifax argued for negotiations involving the Italians, but this was rejected by Churchill with majority support. An approach made through the Swedish ambassador on 22 June was reported to Hitler, making peace negotiations seem feasible. Throughout July, as the battle started, the Germans made wider attempts to find a diplomatic solution.[61] On 2 July, the day the armed forces were asked to start preliminary planning for an invasion, Hitler got von Ribbentrop to draft a speech offering peace negotiations. On 19 July Hitler made this speech to the German Parliament in Berlin, appealing \"to reason and common sense\", and said he could \"see no reason why this war should go on\".[62] His sombre conclusion was received in silence, but he did not suggest negotiations and this was effectively an ultimatum which was rejected by the British government.[63][64] Halifax kept trying to arrange peace until he was sent to Washington in December as ambassador,[65] and in January 1941 Hitler expressed continued interest in negotiating peace with Britain.[66]\nA May 1939 planning exercise by Luftflotte 3 found that the Luftwaffe lacked the means to do much damage to Britain's war economy beyond laying naval mines.[67] The Head of Luftwaffe intelligence Joseph \"Beppo\" Schmid presented a report on 22 November 1939, stating that \"Of all Germany's possible enemies, Britain is the most dangerous.\"[68] This \"Proposal for the Conduct of Air Warfare\" argued for a counter to the British blockade and said \"Key is to paralyse the British trade\".[50] Instead of the Wehrmacht attacking the French, the Luftwaffe with naval assistance was to block imports to Britain and attack seaports. \"Should the enemy resort to terror measures\u2014for example, to attack our towns in western Germany\" they could retaliate by bombing industrial centres and London. Parts of this appeared on 29 November in \"Directive No. 9\" as future actions once the coast had been conquered.[51] On 24 May 1940 \"Directive No. 13\" authorised attacks on the blockade targets, as well as retaliation for RAF bombing of industrial targets in the Ruhr.[52]\nAfter the defeat of France the High Command (OKW) felt they had won the war, and some more pressure would persuade Britain. On 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his paper setting out options: the first was to increase attacks on shipping, economic targets and the RAF: air attacks and food shortages were expected to break morale and lead to capitulation. Destruction of the RAF was the first priority, and invasion would be a last resort. Hermann G\u00f6ring's operational directive issued the same day ordered destruction of the RAF to clear the way for attacks cutting off seaborne supplies to Britain. It made no mention of invasion.[54][69]\nIn November 1939, the OKW reviewed the potential for an air- and seaborne invasion of Britain: the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) was faced with the threat the Royal Navy's larger Home Fleet posed to a crossing of the English Channel, and together with the German Army viewed control of airspace as a necessary precondition. The Luftwaffe said invasion could only be \"the final act in an already victorious war.\"[70]\nHitler first discussed the idea at a 21 May 1940 meeting with Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, who stressed the difficulties and his own preference for a blockade. OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl's 30 June report described invasion as a last resort once the British economy had been damaged and the Luftwaffe had full air superiority. On 2 July, OKW requested preliminary plans.[20][64] In Britain, Churchill described \"the great invasion scare\" as \"serving a very useful purpose\" by \"keeping every man and woman tuned to a high pitch of readiness\".[71] On 10 July, he advised the War Cabinet that invasion could be ignored, as it \"would be a most hazardous and suicidal operation\".[72]\nOn 11 July, Hitler agreed with Raeder that invasion would be a last resort, and the Luftwaffe advised that gaining air superiority would take 14 to 28 days. Hitler met his army chiefs, von Brauchitsch and Halder, who presented detailed plans on the assumption that the navy would provide safe transport.[73] Hitler showed no interest in the details, but on 16 July he issued Directive No. 16 ordering preparations for Operation Sea Lion.[74]\nThe navy insisted on a narrow beachhead and an extended period for landing troops; the army rejected these plans: the Luftwaffe could begin an air attack in August. Hitler held a meeting of his army and navy chiefs on 31 July. The navy said 22 September was the earliest possible date, and proposed postponement until the spring, but Hitler preferred September. He then told von Brauchitsch and Halder that he would decide on the landing operation eight to fourteen days after the air attack began. On 1 August he issued Directive No. 17 for intensified air and sea warfare, to begin with Adlertag on or after 5 August subject to weather, keeping options open for negotiated peace or blockade and siege.[75]\nUnder the continuing influence of the 1935 \"Conduct of the Air War\" doctrine, the main focus of the Luftwaffe command (including G\u00f6ring) was in concentrating attacks to destroy enemy armed forces on the battlefield, and \"blitzkrieg\" close air support of the army succeeded brilliantly. They reserved strategic bombing for a stalemate situation or revenge attacks, but doubted if this could be decisive on its own and regarded bombing civilians to destroy homes or undermine morale as a waste of strategic effort.[76][77]\nThe defeat of France in June 1940 introduced the prospect for the first time of independent air action against Britain. A July Fliegercorps I paper asserted that Germany was by definition an air power: \"Its chief weapon against England is the Air Force, then the Navy, followed by the landing forces and the Army.\" In 1940, the Luftwaffe would undertake a \"strategic offensive ... on its own and independent of the other services\", according to an April 1944 German account of their military mission. G\u00f6ring was convinced that strategic bombing could win objectives which were beyond the army and navy, and gain political advantages in the Third Reich for the Luftwaffe and himself.[78] He expected air warfare to decisively force Britain to negotiate, as all in the OKW hoped, and the Luftwaffe took little interest to planning to support an invasion.[79][54]\nThe Luftwaffe faced a more capable opponent than any it had previously met: a sizeable, highly coordinated, well-supplied, modern air force.\nThe Luftwaffe's Messerschmitt Bf 109E and Bf 110C fought against the RAF's workhorse Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Spitfire Mk I; Hurricanes outnumbered Spitfires in RAF Fighter Command by about 2:1 when war broke out.[80] The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was up to 40\u00a0mph faster in level flight than the Rotol (constant speed propeller) equipped Hurricane Mk I, depending on altitude.[81] The speed and climb disparity with the original non-Rotol Hurricane was even greater. By the end of spring 1940, all RAF Spitfire and Hurricane fighter squadrons converted to 100 octane aviation fuel,[82] which allowed their Merlin engines to generate significantly more power and an approximately 30\u00a0mph increase in speed at low altitudes[83][84] through the use of an Emergency Boost Override.[85][86][87] In September 1940, the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service in small numbers.[88] This version was capable of a maximum speed of 342\u00a0mph (550\u00a0km/h), some 20\u00a0mph more than the original (non-Rotol) Mk I, though it was still 15 to 20\u00a0mph slower than a Bf 109 (depending on altitude).[89]\nThe performance of the Spitfire over Dunkirk came as a surprise to the Jagdwaffe, although the German pilots retained a strong belief that the 109 was the superior fighter.[90] The British fighters were equipped with eight Browning .303 (7.7mm) machine guns, while most Bf 109Es had two 7.92mm machine guns supplemented by two 20mm cannons.[nb 10] The latter was much more effective than the .303; during the Battle it was not unknown for damaged German bombers to limp home with up to two hundred .303 hits.[91] At some altitudes, the Bf 109 could outclimb the British fighter. It could also engage in vertical-plane negative-g manoeuvres without the engine cutting out because its DB 601 engine used fuel injection; this allowed the 109 to dive away from attackers more readily than the carburettor-equipped Merlin. On the other hand, the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than its two foes.[92] In general, though, as Alfred Price noted in The Spitfire Story:\n...\u00c2\u00a0the differences between the Spitfire and the Me 109 in performance and handling were only marginal, and in a combat they were almost always surmounted by tactical considerations of which side had seen the other first, which had the advantage of sun, altitude, numbers, pilot ability, tactical situation, tactical co-ordination, amount of fuel remaining, etc.[93]\nThe Bf 109E was also used as a Jabo (jagdbomber, fighter-bomber)\u2014the E-4/B and E-7 models could carry a 250\u00a0kg bomb underneath the fuselage, the later model arriving during the battle. The Bf 109, unlike the Stuka, could fight on equal terms with RAF fighters after releasing its ordnance.[94][95]\nAt the start of the battle, the twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110C long range Zerst\u00f6rer (\"Destroyer\") was also expected to engage in air-to-air combat while escorting the Luftwaffe bomber fleet. Although the 110 was faster than the Hurricane and almost as fast as the Spitfire, its lack of manoeuvrability and acceleration meant that it was a failure as a long-range escort fighter. On 13 and 15 August, thirteen and thirty aircraft were lost, the equivalent of an entire Gruppe, and the type's worst losses during the campaign.[96] This trend continued with a further eight and fifteen lost on 16 and 17 August.[97] G\u00f6ring ordered the Bf 110 units to operate \"where the range of the single-engined machines were not sufficient\".[citation needed]\nThe most successful role of the Bf 110 during the battle was as a Schnellbomber (fast bomber). The Bf 110 usually used a shallow dive to bomb the target and escape at high speed.[98][99] One unit, Erprobungsgruppe 210 \u2013 initially formed as the service test unit (Erprobungskommando) for the emerging successor to the 110, the Me 210 \u2013 proved that the Bf 110 could still be used to good effect in attacking small or \"pinpoint\" targets.[98]\nThe RAF's Boulton Paul Defiant had some initial success over Dunkirk because of its resemblance to the Hurricane; Luftwaffe fighters attacking from the rear were surprised by its unusual gun turret.[100] However, during the Battle of Britain, this single-engined two-seater proved hopelessly outclassed. For various reasons, the Defiant lacked any form of forward-firing armament, and the heavy turret and second crewman meant it could not outrun or outmanoeuvre either the Bf 109 or Bf 110. By the end of August, after disastrous losses, the aircraft was withdrawn from daylight service.[101][102]\nThe Luftwaffe's primary bombers were the Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17, and Junkers Ju 88 for level bombing at medium to high altitudes, and the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka for dive bombing tactics. The He 111 was used in greater numbers than the others during the conflict, and was better known, partly due to its distinctive wing shape. Each level bomber also had a few reconnaissance versions accompanying them that were used during the battle.[103]\nAlthough it had been successful in previous Luftwaffe engagements, the Stuka suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Britain, particularly on 18 August, due to its slow speed and vulnerability to fighter interception after dive bombing a target. As the losses went up along with their limited payload and range, Stuka units were largely removed from operations over England and diverted to concentrate on shipping instead until they were eventually re-deployed to the Eastern Front in 1941. However, for some raids, they were called back, such as on 13 September to attack Tangmere airfield.[104][105][106]\nThe remaining three bomber types differed in their capabilities; the Heinkel 111 was the slowest; the Ju 88 was the fastest once its mainly external bomb load was dropped; and the Do 17 had the smallest bomb load.[103] All three bomber types suffered heavy losses from the home-based British fighters, but the Ju 88 disproportionately so. The German bombers required constant protection by the Luftwaffe's fighter force. German escorts, however, were not sufficiently numerous. Bf 109Es were ordered to support more than 300\u00e2\u20ac\u201c400 bombers on any given day.[107] Later in the conflict, when night bombing became more frequent, all three were used. However, due to its smaller bomb load, the lighter Do 17 was used less than the He 111 and Ju 88 for this purpose.\nOn the British side, three bomber types were mostly used on night operations against targets such as factories, invasion ports and railway centres; the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, the Handley-Page Hampden and the Vickers Wellington were classified as heavy bombers by the RAF, although the Hampden was a medium bomber comparable to the He 111. The twin-engined Bristol Blenheim and the obsolescent single-engined Fairey Battle were both light bombers; the Blenheim was the most numerous of the aircraft equipping RAF Bomber Command and was used in attacks against shipping, ports, airfields and factories on the continent by day and by night. The Fairey Battle squadrons, which had suffered heavy losses in daylight attacks during the Battle of France, were brought up to strength with reserve aircraft and continued to operate at night in attacks against the invasion ports, until the Battle was withdrawn from UK front line service in October 1940.[108][110]\nBefore the war, the RAF's processes for selecting potential candidates were opened to men of all social classes through the creation in 1936 of the RAF Volunteer Reserve, which \"...\u00a0was designed to appeal, to\u00a0... young men\u00a0... without any class distinctions\u00a0...\"[111] The older squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force did retain some of their upper-class exclusiveness,[112] but their numbers were soon swamped by the newcomers of the RAFVR; by 1 September 1939, 6,646 pilots had been trained through the RAFVR.[113]\nBy summer 1940, there were about 9,000 pilots in the RAF to man about 5,000 aircraft, most of which were bombers.[citation needed] Fighter Command was never short of pilots, but the problem of finding sufficient numbers of fully trained fighter pilots became acute by mid-August 1940.[114] With aircraft production running at 300 planes each week, only 200 pilots were trained in the same period. In addition, more pilots were allocated to squadrons than there were aircraft, as this allowed squadrons to maintain operational strength despite casualties and still provide for pilot leave.[115] Another factor was that only about 30% of the 9,000 pilots were assigned to operational squadrons; 20% of the pilots were involved in conducting pilot training, and a further 20% were undergoing further instruction, like those offered in Canada and in Southern Rhodesia to the Commonwealth trainees, although already qualified. The rest were assigned to staff positions, since RAF policy dictated that only pilots could make many staff and operational command decisions, even in engineering matters. At the height of fighting, and despite Churchill's insistence, only 30 pilots were released to the front line from administrative duties.[116][nb 12]\nFor these reasons, and the permanent loss of 435 pilots during the Battle of France alone[37] along with many more wounded, and others lost in Norway, the RAF had fewer experienced pilots at the start of the initial defence of their home. It was the lack of trained pilots in the fighting squadrons, rather than the lack of aircraft, that became the greatest concern for Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, Commander of Fighter Command. Drawing from regular RAF forces, the Auxiliary Air Force and the Volunteer Reserve, the British were able to muster some 1,103 fighter pilots on 1 July. Replacement pilots, with little flight training and often no gunnery training, suffered high casualty rates, thus exacerbating the problem.[117]\nThe Luftwaffe, on the other hand, were able to muster a larger number (1,450) of more experienced fighter pilots.[116] Drawing from a cadre of Spanish Civil War veterans, these pilots already had comprehensive courses in aerial gunnery and instructions in tactics suited for fighter-versus-fighter combat.[118] Training manuals discouraged heroism, stressing the importance of attacking only when the odds were in the pilot's favour. Despite the high levels of experience, German fighter formations did not provide a sufficient reserve of pilots to allow for losses and leave,[115] and the Luftwaffe was unable to produce enough pilots to prevent a decline in operational strength as the battle progressed.\nAbout 20% of pilots who took part in the battle were from non British countries. The Royal Air Force roll of honour for the Battle of Britain recognises 595 non-British pilots (out of 2,936) as flying at least one authorised operational sortie with an eligible unit of the RAF or Fleet Air Arm between 10 July and 31 October 1940.[10][119] These included 145 Poles, 127 New Zealanders, 112 Canadians, 88 Czechoslovaks, 10 Irish, 32 Australians, 28 Belgians, 25 South Africans, 13 French, 9 Americans, 3 Southern Rhodesians and one each from Jamaica and Mandatory Palestine.[120] \"Altogether in the fighter battles, the bombing raids, and the various patrols flown between 10 July and 31 October 1940 by the Royal Air Force, 1495 aircrew were killed, of whom 449 were fighter pilots, 718 aircrew from Bomber Command, and 280 from Coastal Command. Among those killed were 47 airmen from Canada, 24 from Australia, 17 from South Africa, 35 from Poland, 20 from Czechoslovakia and six from Belgium. Forty-seven New Zealanders lost their lives, including 15 fighter pilots, 24 bomber and eight coastal aircrew. The names of these Allied and Commonwealth airmen are inscribed in a memorial book which rests in the Battle of Britain Chapel in Westminster Abbey. In the chapel is a stained glass window which contains the badges of the fighter squadrons which operated during the battle and the flags of the nations to which the pilots and aircrew belonged.\"[121]\nThese pilots, some of who had to flee their home countries because of the Nazi war-machine, fought with great distinction. The No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron for example was not just the highest scoring of the Hurricane squadrons during the Battle of Britain, but also had the highest ratio of enemy aircraft destroyed to their own losses.[122][123][124]\nAn element of the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) called the Italian Air Corps (Corpo Aereo Italiano or CAI) first saw action in late October 1940. It took part in the latter stages of the battle, but achieved limited success. The unit was redeployed in early 1941.\nThe high command's indecision over which aim to pursue was reflected in shifts in Luftwaffe strategy. Their Air War doctrine of concentrated close air support of the army at the battlefront succeeded in the blitzkrieg offensives against Poland, Denmark and Norway, the Low Countries and France, but incurred significant losses. The Luftwaffe now had to establish or restore bases in the conquered territories, and rebuild their strength. In June 1940 they began regular armed reconnaissance flights and sporadic St\u00f6rangriffe, nuisance raids of one or a few bombers, both day and night. These gave crews practice in navigation and avoiding air defences, and set off air raid alarms which disturbed civilian morale. Similar nuisance raids continued throughout the battle, into the winter months of 1940. Scattered naval mine\u2013laying sorties began at the outset, and increased gradually over the battle period.[125][126]\nG\u00f6ring's operational directive of 30 June ordered destruction of the RAF as a whole, including the aircraft industry, with the aims of ending RAF bombing raids on Germany and facilitating attacks on ports and storage in the Luftwaffe blockade of Britain.[54] Attacks on Channel shipping in the Kanalkampf began on 4 July, and were formalised on 11 July in an order by Hans Jeschonnek which added the arms industry as a target.[127][128]\nOn 16 July Directive No. 16 ordered preparations for Operation Sea Lion, and on the next day the luftwaffe was ordered to stand by in full readiness. G\u00c3\u00b6ring met his air fleet commanders, and on 24 July issued \"Tasks and Goals\" of gaining air supremacy, protecting the army and navy if invasion went ahead, and attacking the Royal Navy's ships as well as continuing the blockade. Once the RAF had been defeated, Luftwaffe bombers were to move forward beyond London without the need for fighter escort, destroying military and economic targets.[57]\nAt a meeting on 1 August the command reviewed plans produced by each Fliegerkorps with differing proposals for targets including whether to bomb airfields, but failed to focus priorities. Intelligence reports gave G\u00f6ring the impression that the RAF was almost defeated: the intent was that raids would attract British fighters for the Luftwaffe to shoot down.[129] On 6 August he finalised plans for this \"Operation Eagle Attack\" with Kesselring, Sperle and Stumpff: destruction of RAF Fighter Command across the south of England was to take four days, with lightly escorted small bomber raids leaving the main fighter force free to attack RAF fighters. Bombing of military and economic targets was then to systematically extend up to the Midlands until daylight attacks could proceed unhindered over the whole of Britain.[130][131]\nBombing of London was to be held back while these night time \"destroyer\" attacks proceeded over other urban areas, then in culmination of the campaign a major attack on the capital was intended to cause a crisis when refugees fled London just as the Operation Sea Lion invasion was to begin.[132] With hopes fading for the possibility of invasion, on 4 September Hitler authorised a main focus on day and night attacks on tactical targets with London as the main target, in what the British called the Blitz. With increasing difficulty in defending bombers in day raids, the Luftwaffe shifted to a strategic bombing campaign of night raids aiming to overcome British resistance by damaging infrastructure and food stocks, though intentional terror bombing of civilians was not sanctioned.[133]\nThe Luftwaffe was forced to regroup after the Battle of France into three Luftflotten (Air Fleets) on Britain's southern and northern flanks. Luftflotte 2, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, was responsible for the bombing of southeast England and the London area. Luftflotte 3, under Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle, targeted the West Country, Wales, the Midlands, and northwest England. Luftflotte 5, led by Generaloberst Hans-J\u00fcrgen Stumpff from his headquarters in Norway, targeted the north of England and Scotland. As the battle progressed, command responsibility shifted, with Luftflotte 3 taking more responsibility for the night-time Blitz attacks while the main daylight operations fell upon Luftflotte 2's shoulders.\nInitial Luftwaffe estimates were that it would take four days to defeat the RAF Fighter Command in southern England. This would be followed by a four-week offensive during which the bombers and long-range fighters would destroy all military installations throughout the country and wreck the British aircraft industry. The campaign was planned to begin with attacks on airfields near the coast, gradually moving inland to attack the ring of sector airfields defending London. Later reassessments gave the Luftwaffe five weeks, from 8 August to 15 September, to establish temporary air superiority over England.[134] To achieve this goal, Fighter Command had to be destroyed, either on the ground or in the air, yet the Luftwaffe had to be able to preserve its own strength to be able to support the invasion; this meant that the Luftwaffe had to maintain a high \"kill ratio\" over the RAF fighters. The only alternative to the goal of air superiority was a terror bombing campaign aimed at the civilian population, but this was considered a last resort and it was (at this stage of the battle) expressly forbidden by Hitler.[134]\nThe Luftwaffe kept broadly to this scheme, but its commanders had differences of opinion on strategy. Sperrle wanted to eradicate the air defence infrastructure by bombing it. His counterpart, Kesselring, championed attacking London directly\u2014 either to bombard the British government into submission, or to draw RAF fighters into a decisive battle. G\u00f6ring did nothing to resolve this disagreement between his commanders, and only vague directives were set down during the initial stages of the battle, with G\u00f6ring seemingly unable to decide upon which strategy to pursue.[135] He seemed at times obsessed with maintaining his own power base in the Luftwaffe and indulging his outdated beliefs on air fighting, which would later lead to tactical and strategic errors.[citation needed]\nLuftwaffe formations employed a loose section of two (nicknamed the Rotte (pack)), based on a leader (Rottenf\u00fchrer) followed at a distance of about 200 metres[nb 14] by his wingman (nicknamed the Rottenhund (pack dog) or Katschmarek[136]), who also flew slightly higher and was trained always to stay with his leader. With more room between them, both pilots could spend less time maintaining formation and more time looking around and covering each other's blind spots. Attacking aircraft could be sandwiched between the two 109s.[137] [nb 15] The Rotte allowed the Rottenf\u00fchrer to concentrate on getting kills, but few wingmen had the chance,[139] leading to some resentment in the lower ranks where it was felt that the high scores came at their expense. Two sections were usually teamed up into a Schwarm, where all the pilots could watch what was happening around them. Each Schwarm in a Staffel flew at staggered heights and with about 200 metres of room between them, making the formation difficult to spot at longer ranges and allowing for a great deal of flexibility.[118] By using a tight \"cross-over\" turn, a Schwarm could quickly change direction.[137]\nThe Bf 110s adopted the same Schwarm formation as the 109s, but were seldom able to use this to the same advantage. The Bf 110's most successful method of attack was the \"bounce\" from above. When attacked, Zerst\u00f6rergruppen increasingly resorted to forming large \"defensive circles\", where each Bf 110 guarded the tail of the aircraft ahead of it. G\u00f6ring ordered that they be renamed \"offensive circles\" in a vain bid to improve rapidly declining morale.[140] These conspicuous formations were often successful in attracting RAF fighters that were sometimes \"bounced\" by high-flying Bf 109s. This led to the often repeated misconception that the Bf 110s were escorted by Bf 109s.\nLuftwaffe tactics were influenced by their fighters. The Bf 110 proved too vulnerable to the nimble single-engined RAF fighters. This meant the bulk of fighter escort duties fell on the Bf 109. Fighter tactics were then complicated by bomber crews who demanded closer protection. After the hard-fought battles of 15 and 18 August, G\u00f6ring met with his unit leaders. During this conference, the need for the fighters to meet up on time with the bombers was stressed. It was also decided that one bomber Gruppe could only be properly protected by several Gruppen of 109s. In addition, G\u00f6ring stipulated that as many fighters as possible were to be left free for Freie Jagd (\"Free Hunts\": a free-roving fighter sweep preceded a raid to try to sweep defenders out of the raid's path). The Ju 87 units, which had suffered heavy casualties, were only to be used under favourable circumstances.[141] In early September, due to increasing complaints from the bomber crews about RAF fighters seemingly able to get through the escort screen, G\u00f6ring ordered an increase in close escort duties. This decision shackled many of the Bf 109s to the bombers and, although they were more successful at protecting the bomber forces, casualties amongst the fighters mounted primarily because they were forced to fly and manoeuvre at reduced speeds.[142]\nThe Luftwaffe consistently varied its tactics in its attempts to break through the RAF defences. It launched many Freie Jagd to draw up RAF fighters. RAF fighter controllers, however, were often able to detect these and position squadrons to avoid them, keeping to Dowding's plan to preserve fighter strength for the bomber formations. The Luftwaffe also tried using small formations of bombers as bait, covering them with large numbers of escorts. This was more successful, but escort duty tied the fighters to the bombers' slow speed and made them more vulnerable.\nBy September, standard tactics for raids had become an amalgam of techniques. A Freie Jagd would precede the main attack formations. The bombers would fly in at altitudes between 16,000 feet (4,900\u00a0m) and 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m), closely escorted by fighters. Escorts were divided into two parts (usually Gruppen), some operating in close contact with the bombers, and others a few hundred yards away and a little above. If the formation was attacked from the starboard, the starboard section engaged the attackers, the top section moving to starboard and the port section to the top position. If the attack came from the port side the system was reversed. British fighters coming from the rear were engaged by the rear section and the two outside sections similarly moving to the rear. If the threat came from above, the top section went into action while the side sections gained height to be able to follow RAF fighters down as they broke away. If attacked, all sections flew in defensive circles. These tactics were skilfully evolved and carried out, and were difficult to counter.[143]\nAdolf Galland noted:\nWe had the impression that, whatever we did, we were bound to be wrong. Fighter protection for bombers created many problems which had to be solved in action. Bomber pilots preferred close screening in which their formation was surrounded by pairs of fighters pursuing a zigzag course. Obviously, the visible presence of the protective fighters gave the bomber pilots a greater sense of security. However, this was a faulty conclusion, because a fighter can only carry out this purely defensive task by taking the initiative in the offensive. He must never wait until attacked because he then loses the chance of acting.\nWe fighter pilots certainly preferred the free chase during the approach and over the target area. This gives the greatest relief and the best protection for the bomber force.[144]\nThe biggest disadvantage faced by Bf 109 pilots was that without the benefit of long-range drop tanks (which were introduced in limited numbers in the late stages of the battle), usually of 300 litres (66\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 79\u00a0US\u00a0gal) capacity, the 109s had an endurance of just over an hour and, for the 109E, a 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) range. Once over Britain, a 109 pilot had to keep an eye on a red \"low fuel\" light on the instrument panel: once this was illuminated, he was forced to turn back and head for France. With the prospect of two long flights over water, and knowing their range was substantially reduced when escorting bombers or during combat, the Jagdflieger coined the term Kanalkrankheit or \"Channel sickness\".[145]\nThe Luftwaffe was ill-served by its lack of military intelligence about the British defences.[146] The German intelligence services were fractured and plagued by rivalries; their performance was \"amateurish\".[147] By 1940, there were few German agents operating in Great Britain and a handful of bungled attempts to insert spies into the country were foiled.[148]\nAs a result of intercepted radio transmissions, the Germans began to realise that the RAF fighters were being controlled from ground facilities; in July and August 1939, for example, the airship Graf Zeppelin, which was packed with equipment for listening in on RAF radio and RDF transmissions, flew around the coasts of Britain. Although the Luftwaffe correctly interpreted these new ground control procedures, they were incorrectly assessed as being rigid and ineffectual. A British radar system was well known to the Luftwaffe from intelligence gathered before the war, but the highly developed \"Dowding system\" linked with fighter control had been a well-kept secret.[149][150] Even when good information existed, such as a November 1939 Abwehr assessment of Fighter Command strengths and capabilities by Abteilung V, it was ignored if it did not match conventional preconceptions.\nOn 16 July 1940, Abteilung V, commanded by Oberstleutnant \"Beppo\" Schmid, produced a report on the RAF and on Britain's defensive capabilities which was adopted by the frontline commanders as a basis for their operational plans. One of the most conspicuous failures of the report was the lack of information on the RAF's RDF network and control systems capabilities; it was assumed that the system was rigid and inflexible, with the RAF fighters being \"tied\" to their home bases.[151][152] An optimistic and, as it turned out, erroneous conclusion reached was:\nD. Supply Situation...\u00c2\u00a0At present the British aircraft industry produces about 180 to 300 first line fighters and 140 first line bombers a month. In view of the present conditions relating to production (the appearance of raw material difficulties, the disruption or breakdown of production at factories owing to air attacks, the increased vulnerability to air attack owing to the fundamental reorganisation of the aircraft industry now in progress), it is believed that for the time being output will decrease rather than increase.\nIn the event of an intensification of air warfare it is expected that the present strength of the RAF will fall, and this decline will be aggravated by the continued decrease in production.[152]\nBecause of this statement, reinforced by another more detailed report, issued on 10 August, there was a mindset in the ranks of the Luftwaffe that the RAF would run out of frontline fighters.[151] The Luftwaffe believed it was weakening Fighter Command at three times the actual attrition rate.[153] Many times, the leadership believed Fighter Command's strength had collapsed, only to discover that the RAF were able to send up defensive formations at will.\nThroughout the battle, the Luftwaffe had to use numerous reconnaissance sorties to make up for the poor intelligence. Reconnaissance aircraft (initially mostly Dornier Do 17s, but increasingly Bf 110s) proved easy prey for British fighters, as it was seldom possible for them to be escorted by Bf 109s. Thus, the Luftwaffe operated \"blind\" for much of the battle, unsure of its enemy's true strengths, capabilities, and deployments. Many of the Fighter Command airfields were never attacked, while raids against supposed fighter airfields fell instead on bomber or coastal defence stations. The results of bombing and air fighting were consistently exaggerated, due to inaccurate claims, over-enthusiastic reports and the difficulty of confirmation over enemy territory. In the euphoric atmosphere of perceived victory, the Luftwaffe leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality. This lack of leadership and solid intelligence meant the Germans did not adopt consistent strategy, even when the RAF had its back to the wall. Moreover, there was never a systematic focus on one type of target (such as airbases, radar stations, or aircraft factories); consequently, the already haphazard effort was further diluted.[154]\nWhile the British were using radar for air defence more effectively than the Germans realised, the Luftwaffe attempted to press its own offensive with advanced radio navigation systems of which the British were initially not aware. One of these was Knickebein (\"bent leg\"); this system was used at night and for raids where precision was required. It was rarely used during the Battle of Britain.[155]\nThe Luftwaffe was much better prepared for the task of air-sea rescue than the RAF, specifically tasking the Seenotdienst unit, equipped with about 30 Heinkel He 59 floatplanes, with picking up downed aircrew from the North Sea, English Channel and the Dover Straits. In addition, Luftwaffe aircraft were equipped with life rafts and the aircrew were provided with sachets of a chemical called fluorescein which, on reacting with water, created a large, easy-to-see, bright green patch.[156][157] In accordance with the Geneva Convention, the He 59s were unarmed and painted white with civilian registration markings and red crosses. Nevertheless, RAF aircraft attacked these aircraft, as some were escorted by Bf 109s.[158]\nAfter single He 59s were forced to land on the sea by RAF fighters, on 1 and 9 July respectively,[158][159] a controversial order was issued to the RAF on 13 July; this stated that from 20 July, Seenotdienst aircraft were to be shot down. One of the reasons given by Churchill was:\nWe did not recognise this means of rescuing enemy pilots so they could come and bomb our civil population again\u00c2\u00a0... all German air ambulances were forced down or shot down by our fighters on definite orders approved by the War Cabinet.[160]\nThe British also believed that their crews would report on convoys,[157] the Air Ministry issuing a communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 to the German government on 14 July that Britain was\nunable, however, to grant immunity to such aircraft flying over areas in which operations are in progress on land or at sea, or approaching British or Allied territory, or territory in British occupation, or British or Allied ships. Ambulance aircraft which do not comply with the above will do so at their own risk and peril[161]\nThe white He 59s were soon repainted in camouflage colours and armed with defensive machine guns. Although another four He 59s were shot down by RAF aircraft,[162] the Seenotdienst continued to pick up downed Luftwaffe and Allied aircrew throughout the battle, earning praise from Adolf Galland for their bravery.[163]\nDuring early tests of the Chain Home system, the slow flow of information from the CH radars and observers to the aircraft often caused them to miss their \"bandits\". The solution, today known as the \"Dowding system\", was to create a set of reporting chains to move information from the various observation points to the pilots in their fighters. It was named after its chief architect, \"Stuffy\" Dowding.[164]\nReports from CH radars and the Observer Corps were sent directly to Fighter Command Headquarters (FCHQ) at Bentley Priory where they were \"filtered\" to combine multiple reports of the same formations into single tracks. Telephone operators would then forward only the information of interest to the Group headquarters, where the map would be re-created. This process was repeated to produce another version of the map at the Sector level, covering a much smaller area. Looking over their maps, Group level commanders could select squadrons to attack particular targets. From that point the Sector operators would give commands to the fighters to arrange an interception, as well as return them to base. Sector stations also controlled the anti-aircraft batteries in their area; an army officer sat beside each fighter controller and directed the gun crews when to open and cease fire.[165]\nThe Dowding system dramatically improved the speed and accuracy of the information that flowed to the pilots. During the early war period it was expected that an average interception mission might have a 30% chance of ever seeing their target. During the battle, the Dowding system maintained an average rate over 75%, with several examples of 100% rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every fighter dispatched found and intercepted its target.[citation needed] In contrast, Luftwaffe fighters attempting to intercept raids had to randomly seek their targets and often returned home having never seen enemy aircraft. The result is what is now known as an example of \"force multiplication\"; RAF fighters were as effective as two or more Luftwaffe fighters, greatly offsetting, or overturning, the disparity in actual numbers.\nWhile Luftwaffe intelligence reports underestimated British fighter forces and aircraft production, the British intelligence estimates went the other way: they overestimated German aircraft production, numbers and range of aircraft available, and numbers of Luftwaffe pilots. In action, the Luftwaffe believed from their pilot claims and the impression given by aerial reconnaissance that the RAF was close to defeat, and the British made strenuous efforts to overcome the perceived advantages held by their opponents.[166]\nIt is unclear how much the British intercepts of the Enigma cipher, used for high-security German radio communications, affected the battle. Ultra, the information obtained from Enigma intercepts, gave the highest echelons of the British command a view of German intentions. According to F. W. Winterbotham, who was the senior Air Staff representative in the Secret Intelligence Service,[167] Ultra helped establish the strength and composition of the Luftwaffe's formations, the aims of the commanders[168] and provided early warning of some raids.[169] In early August it was decided that a small unit would be set up at FCHQ, which would process the flow of information from Bletchley and provide Dowding only with the most essential Ultra material; thus the Air Ministry did not have to send a continual flow of information to FCHQ, preserving secrecy, and Dowding was not inundated with non-essential information. Keith Park and his controllers were also told about Ultra.[170] In a further attempt to camouflage the existence of Ultra, Dowding created a unit named No. 421 (Reconnaissance) Flight RAF. This unit (which later became No. 91 Squadron RAF), was equipped with Hurricanes and Spitfires and sent out aircraft to search for and report Luftwaffe formations approaching England.[171] In addition the radio listening service (known as Y Service), monitoring the patterns of Luftwaffe radio traffic contributed considerably to the early warning of raids.\nOne of the biggest oversights of the entire system was the lack of adequate air-sea rescue organisation. The RAF had started organising a system in 1940 with High Speed Launches (HSLs) based on flying boat bases and at a number of overseas locations, but it was still believed that the amount of cross-Channel traffic meant that there was no need for a rescue service to cover these areas. Downed pilots and aircrew, it was hoped, would be picked up by any boats or ships which happened to be passing by. Otherwise the local life boat would be alerted, assuming someone had seen the pilot going into the water.[172]\nRAF aircrew were issued with a life jacket, nicknamed the \"Mae West,\" but in 1940 it still required manual inflation, which was almost impossible for someone who was injured or in shock. The waters of the English Channel and Dover Straits are cold, even in the middle of summer, and clothing issued to RAF aircrew did little to insulate them against these freezing conditions.[146] The RAF also imitated the German practice of issuing fluorescein.[157] A conference in 1939 had placed air-sea rescue under Coastal Command. Because a number of pilots had been lost at sea during the \"Channel Battle\", on 22 August, control of RAF rescue launches was passed to the local naval authorities and 12 Lysanders were given to Fighter Command to help look for pilots at sea. In all some 200 pilots and aircrew were lost at sea during the battle. No proper air-sea rescue service was formed until 1941.[146]\nIn the late 1930s, Fighter Command expected to face only bombers over Britain, not single-engined fighters. A series of \"Fighting Area Tactics\" were formulated and rigidly adhered to, involving a series of manoeuvres designed to concentrate a squadron's firepower to bring down bombers. RAF fighters flew in tight, v-shaped sections (\"vics\") of three aircraft, with four such \"sections\" in tight formation. Only the squadron leader at the front was free to watch for the enemy; the other pilots had to concentrate on keeping station.[173] Training also emphasised by-the-book attacks by sections breaking away in sequence. Fighter Command recognised the weaknesses of this structure early in the battle, but it was felt too risky to change tactics during the battle, because replacement pilots\u2014often with only minimal flying time\u2014could not be readily retrained,[174] and inexperienced pilots needed firm leadership in the air only rigid formations could provide.[175] German pilots dubbed the RAF formations Idiotenreihen (\"rows of idiots\") because they left squadrons vulnerable to attack.[117][176]\nFront line RAF pilots were acutely aware of the inherent deficiencies of their own tactics. A compromise was adopted whereby squadron formations used much looser formations with one or two \"weavers\" flying independently above and behind to provide increased observation and rear protection; these tended to be the least experienced men and were often the first to be shot down without the other pilots even noticing that they were under attack.[117][177] During the battle, 74 Squadron under Squadron Leader Adolph \"Sailor\" Malan adopted a variation of the German formation called the \"fours in line astern\", which was a vast improvement on the old three aircraft \"vic\". Malan's formation was later generally used by Fighter Command.[178]\nThe weight of the battle fell upon 11 Group. Keith Park's tactics were to dispatch individual squadrons to intercept raids. The intention was to subject incoming bombers to continual attacks by relatively small numbers of fighters and try to break up the tight German formations. Once formations had fallen apart, stragglers could be picked off one by one. Where multiple squadrons reached a raid the procedure was for the slower Hurricanes to tackle the bombers while the more agile Spitfires held up the fighter escort. This ideal was not always achieved, resulting in occasions when Spitfires and Hurricanes reversed roles.[179] Park also issued instructions to his units to engage in frontal attacks against the bombers, which were more vulnerable to such attacks. Again, in the environment of fast moving, three-dimensional air battles, few RAF fighter units were able to attack the bombers from head-on.[179]\nDuring the battle, some commanders, notably Leigh-Mallory, proposed squadrons be formed into \"Big Wings,\" consisting of at least three squadrons, to attack the enemy en masse, a method pioneered by Douglas Bader.\nProponents of this tactic claimed interceptions in large numbers caused greater enemy losses while reducing their own casualties. Opponents pointed out the big wings would take too long to form up, and the strategy ran a greater risk of fighters being caught on the ground refuelling. The big wing idea also caused pilots to overclaim their kills, due to the confusion of a more intense battle zone. This led to the belief big wings were far more effective than they were.[180]\nThe issue caused intense friction between Park and Leigh-Mallory, as 12 Group was tasked with protecting 11 Group's airfields whilst Park's squadrons intercepted incoming raids. However, the delay in forming up Big Wings meant the formations often did not arrive at all or until after German bombers had hit 11 Group's airfields.[181] Dowding, to highlight the problem of the Big Wing's performance, submitted a report compiled by Park to the Air Ministry on 15 November. In the report, he highlighted that during the period of 11 September \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 31 October, the extensive use of the Big Wing had resulted in just 10 interceptions and one German aircraft destroyed, but his report was ignored.[182] Post-war analysis agrees Dowding and Park's approach was best for 11 Group.\nDowding's removal from his post in November 1940 has been blamed on this struggle between Park and Leigh-Mallory's daylight strategy. However, the intensive raids and destruction wrought during the Blitz damaged both Dowding and Park in particular, for the failure to produce an effective night-fighter defence system, something for which the influential Leigh-Mallory had long criticised them.[183]\nBomber Command and Coastal Command aircraft flew offensive sorties against targets in Germany and France during the battle.\nAn hour after the declaration of war, Bomber Command launched raids on warships and naval ports by day, and in night raids dropped leaflets as it was considered illegal to bomb targets which could affect civilians. After the initial disasters of the war, with Vickers Wellington bombers shot down in large numbers attacking Wilhelmshaven and the slaughter of the Fairey Battle squadrons sent to France, it became clear that they would have to operate mainly at night to avoid incurring very high losses.[184] Churchill came to power on 10 May 1940, and night raids on German towns began with the bombing of M\u00f6nchen-Gladbach on the night of 11 May. The War Cabinet on 12 May agreed that German actions justified \"unrestricted warfare\", and on 14 May they authorised an attack on the night of 14/15 May against oil and rail targets in Germany. At the urging of Clement Attlee, the Cabinet on 15 May authorised a full bombing strategy against \"suitable military objectives\", even where there could be civilian casualties. That evening, a night time bomber campaign began against the German oil industry, communications, and forests/crops, mainly in the Ruhr area. The RAF lacked accurate night navigation, and carried small bomb loads.[185] As the threat mounted, Bomber Command changed targeting priority on 3 June 1940 to attack the German aircraft industry. On 4 July, the Air Ministry gave Bomber Command orders to attack ports and shipping. By September, the build-up of invasion barges in the Channel ports had become a top priority target.[186]\nOn 7 September, the government issued a warning that the invasion could be expected within the next few days and, that night, Bomber Command attacked the Channel ports and supply dumps. On 13 September, they carried out another large raid on the Channel ports, sinking 80 large barges in the port of Ostend.[187] 84 barges were sunk in Dunkirk after another raid on 17 September and by 19 September, almost 200 barges had been sunk.[186] The loss of these barges may have contributed to Hitler's decision to postpone Operation Sea Lion indefinitely.[186] The success of these raids was in part because the Germans had few Freya radar stations set up in France, so that air defences of the French harbours were not nearly as good as the air defences over Germany; Bomber Command had directed some 60% of its strength against the Channel ports.\nThe Bristol Blenheim units also raided German-occupied airfields throughout July to December 1940, both during daylight hours and at night. Although most of these raids were unproductive, there were some successes; on 1 August, five out of twelve Blenheims sent to attack Haamstede and Evere (Brussels) were able to destroy or heavily damage three Bf 109s of II./JG 27 and apparently kill a Staffelkapit\u00e4n identified as a Hauptmann Albrecht von Ankum-Frank. Two other 109s were claimed by Blenheim gunners.[188][nb 16] Another successful raid on Haamstede was made by a single Blenheim on 7 August which destroyed one 109 of 4./JG 54, heavily damaged another and caused lighter damage to four more.[189]\nThere were some missions which produced an almost 100% casualty rate amongst the Blenheims; one such operation was mounted on 13 August 1940 against a Luftwaffe airfield near Aalborg in north-eastern Denmark by 12 aircraft of 82 Squadron. One Blenheim returned early (the pilot was later charged and due to appear before a court martial, but was killed on another operation); the other eleven, which reached Denmark, were shot down, five by flak and six by Bf 109s. Of the 33 crewmen who took part in the attack, 20 were killed and 13 captured.[190]\nAs well as the bombing operations, Blenheim-equipped units had been formed to carry out long-range strategic reconnaissance missions over Germany and German-occupied territories. In this role, the Blenheims again proved to be too slow and vulnerable against Luftwaffe fighters, and they took constant casualties.[191][page\u00c2\u00a0needed]\nCoastal Command directed its attention towards the protection of British shipping, and the destruction of enemy shipping. As invasion became more likely, it participated in the strikes on French harbours and airfields, laying mines, and mounting numerous reconnaissance missions over the enemy-held coast. In all, some 9,180 sorties were flown by bombers from July to October 1940. Although this was much less than the 80,000 sorties flown by fighters, bomber crews suffered about half the total number of casualties borne by their fighter colleagues. The bomber contribution was, therefore, much more dangerous on a loss-per-sortie comparison.[192]\nBomber, reconnaissance, and antisubmarine patrol operations continued throughout these months with little respite and none of the publicity accorded to Fighter Command. In his famous 20 August speech about \"The Few\", praising Fighter Command, Churchill also made a point of mentioning Bomber Command's contribution, adding that bombers were even then striking back at Germany; this part of the speech is often overlooked, even today.[193][194] The Battle of Britain Chapel in Westminster Abbey lists in a roll of honour, 718 Bomber Command crew members, and 280 from Coastal Command who were killed between 10 July and 31 October.[195]\nBomber and Coastal Command attacks against invasion barge concentrations in Channel ports were widely reported by the British media during September and October 1940.[196] In what became known as 'the Battle of the Barges' RAF attacks were claimed in British propaganda to have sunk large numbers of barges, and to have created widespread chaos and disruption to German invasion preparations. Given the volume of British propaganda interest in these bomber attacks during September and earlier October, it is striking how quickly this was overlooked once the Battle of Britain had been concluded. Even by mid-war the bomber pilots' efforts had been largely eclipsed by a continuing focus on the Few, this a result of the Air Ministry's continuing valorisation of the \u2033fighter boys\u2033, beginning with the March 1941 Battle of Britain propaganda pamphlet.[197]\nThe battle covered a shifting geographical area, and there have been differing opinions on significant dates: when the Air Ministry proposed 8 August as the start, Dowding responded that operations \"merged into one another almost insensibly\", and proposed 10 July as the onset of increased attacks.[198] With the caution that phases drifted into each other and dates are not firm, the Royal Air Force Museum states that five main phases can be identified:[199]\nThe RAF night bombing campaign against military objectives in German towns began on 11 May. The small forces available were given ambitious objectives, but lacked night navigation capability and their isolated inaccurate attacks were thought by the Germans to be intended to terrorise civilians. From 4 July the RAF achieved some successes with raids on Channel ports, anticipating the build up for an invasion.[185][200]\nFollowing Germany's rapid territorial gains in the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe had to reorganise its forces, set up bases along the coast, and rebuild after heavy losses. It began small scale bombing raids on Britain on the night of 5/6 June, and continued sporadic attacks throughout June and July.[201] The first large-scale attack was at night, on 18/19 June, when small raids scattered between Yorkshire and Kent involved in total 100 bombers.[202] These St\u00f6rangriffe (\"nuisance raids\") which involved only a few aeroplanes, sometimes just one, were used to train bomber crews in both day and night attacks, to test defences and try out methods, with most flights at night. They found that, rather than carrying small numbers of large high explosive bombs, it was more effective to use more small bombs, similarly incendiaries had to cover a large area to set effective fires. These training flights continued through August and into the first week of September.[203] Against this, the raids also gave the British time to assess the German tactics, and invaluable time for the RAF fighters and anti-aircraft defences to prepare and gain practice.[204]\nThe attacks were widespread: over the night of 30 June alarms were set off in 20 counties by just 20 bombers, then next day the first daylight raids occurred during 1 July, on both Hull in Yorkshire and Wick, Caithness. On 3 July most flights were reconnaissance sorties, but 15 civilians were killed when bombs hit Guildford in Surrey.[205] Numerous small St\u00f6rangriffe raids, both day and night, were made daily through August, September and into the winter, with aims including bringing RAF fighters up to battle, destruction of specific military and economic targets, and setting off air-raid warnings to affect civilian morale: four major air-raids in August involved hundreds of bombers, in the same month 1,062 small raids were made, spread across the whole of Britain.[206]\nThe Kanalkampf comprised a series of running fights over convoys in the English Channel. It was launched partly because Kesselring and Sperrle were not sure about what else to do, and partly because it gave German aircrews some training and a chance to probe the British defences.[135] Dowding could provide only minimal shipping protection, and these battles off the coast tended to favour the Germans, whose bomber escorts had the advantage of altitude and outnumbered the RAF fighters. From 9 July reconnaissance probing by Dornier Do 17 bombers put a severe strain on RAF pilots and machines, with high RAF losses to Bf 109s. When nine 141 Squadron Defiants went into action on 19 July six were lost to Bf 109s before a squadron of Hurricanes intervened. On 25 July a coal convoy and escorting destroyers suffered such heavy losses to attacks by Stuka dive bombers that the Admiralty decided convoys should travel at night: the RAF shot down 16 raiders but lost 7 aircraft. By 8 August 18 coal ships and 4 destroyers had been sunk, but the Navy was determined to send a convoy of 20 ships through rather than move the coal by railway. After repeated Stuka attacks that day, six ships were badly damaged, four were sunk and only four reached their destination. The RAF lost 19 fighters and shot down 31 German aircraft. The Navy now cancelled all further convoys through the Channel and sent the cargo by rail. Even so, these early combat encounters provided both sides with experience.[207]\nThe main attack upon the RAF's defences was code-named Adlerangriff (\"Eagle Attack\"). Intelligence reports gave G\u00f6ring the impression that the RAF was almost defeated, and raids would attract British fighters for the Luftwaffe to shoot down.[129] The strategy agreed on 6 August was to destroy RAF Fighter Command across the south of England in four days, then bombing of military and economic targets was to systematically extend up to the Midlands until daylight attacks could proceed unhindered over the whole of Britain, culminating in a major bombing attack on London.[130][208]\nPoor weather delayed Adlertag (\"Eagle Day\") until 13 August 1940. On 12 August, the first attempt was made to blind the Dowding system, when aircraft from the specialist fighter-bomber unit Erprobungsgruppe 210 attacked four radar stations. Three were briefly taken off the air but were back working within six hours.[209] The raids appeared to show that British radars were difficult to knock out. The failure to mount follow-up attacks allowed the RAF to get the stations back on the air, and the Luftwaffe neglected strikes on the supporting infrastructure, such as phone lines and power stations, which could have rendered the radars useless, even if the towers themselves (which were very difficult to destroy) remained intact.[154]\nAdlertag opened with a series of attacks, led again by Epro 210,[209] on coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, as well as 'satellite airfields'[nb 17] (including Manston and Hawkinge).[209] As the week drew on, the airfield attacks moved further inland, and repeated raids were made on the radar chain. 15 August was \"The Greatest Day\" when the Luftwaffe mounted the largest number of sorties of the campaign. Luftflotte 5 attacked the north of England. Believing Fighter Command strength to be concentrated in the south, raiding forces from Denmark and Norway ran into unexpectedly strong resistance. Inadequately escorted by Bf 110s, bombers were shot down in large numbers. North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt 110s, and RAF Great Driffield was attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent, 75 planes were destroyed and many others damaged beyond repair. Furthermore, due to early engagement by RAF fighters many of the bombers dropped their payloads ineffectively early.[210] As a result of these casualties, Luftflotte 5 did not appear in strength again in the campaign.\n18 August, which had the greatest number of casualties to both sides, has been dubbed \"The Hardest Day\". Following this grinding battle, exhaustion and the weather reduced operations for most of a week, allowing the Luftwaffe to review their performance. \"The Hardest Day\" had sounded the end for the Ju 87 in the campaign.[211] This veteran of Blitzkrieg was too vulnerable to fighters to operate over Britain. So as to preserve the Stuka force, G\u00c3\u00b6ring withdrew them from the fighting. This removed the main Luftwaffe precision-bombing weapon and shifted the burden of pinpoint attacks on the already-stretched Erpro 210. The Bf 110 proved too clumsy for dogfighting with single-engined fighters, and its participation was scaled back. It would only be used when range required it or when sufficient single-engined escort could not be provided for the bombers.\nG\u00f6ring made yet another fateful decision: to order more bomber escorts at the expense of free-hunting sweeps. To achieve this, the weight of the attack now fell on Luftflotte 2, and the bulk of the Bf 109s in Luftflotte 3 were transferred to Kesselring's command, reinforcing the fighter bases in the Pas-de-Calais. Stripped of its fighters, Luftflotte 3 would concentrate on the night bombing campaign. G\u00f6ring, expressing disappointment with the fighter performance thus far in the campaign, also made sweeping changes in the command structure of the fighter units, replacing many Geschwaderkommodore with younger, more aggressive pilots like Adolf Galland and Werner M\u00f6lders.[212]\nFinally, G\u00c3\u00b6ring stopped the attacks on the radar chain. These were seen as unsuccessful, and neither the Reichsmarschall nor his subordinates realised how vital the Chain Home stations were to the defence systems. It was known that radar provided some early warning of raids, but the belief among German fighter pilots was that anything bringing up the \"Tommies\" to fight was to be encouraged.[citation needed]\nOn the afternoon of 15 August, Hauptmann Walter Rubensd\u00f6rffer leading Erprobungsgruppe 210 mistakenly bombed Croydon airfield (on the outskirts of London) instead of the intended target, RAF Kenley.[213]\nGerman intelligence reports made the Luftwaffe optimistic that the RAF, thought to be dependent on local air control, was struggling with supply problems and pilot losses. After a major raid attacking Biggin Hill on 18 August, Luftwaffe aircrew said they had been unopposed, the airfield was \"completely destroyed\", and asked \"Is England already finished?\" In accordance with the strategy agreed on 6 August, defeat of the RAF was to be followed by bombing military and economic targets, systematically extending up to the Midlands.[214]\nG\u00c3\u00b6ring ordered attacks on aircraft factories on 19 August 1940.[187] Sixty raids on the night of 19/20 August targeted the aircraft industry and harbours, and bombs fell on suburban areas around London: Croydon, Wimbledon and the Maldens.[215] Night raids were made on 21/22 August on Aberdeen, Bristol and South Wales. That morning, bombs were dropped on Harrow and Wealdstone, on the outskirts of London. Overnight on 22/23 August, the output of an aircraft factory at Filton near Bristol was drastically affected by a raid in which Ju88 bombers released over 16 tons of high explosive bombs. On the night of 23/24 August over 200 bombers attacked the Fort Dunlop tyre factory in Birmingham, with a significant effect on production. A sustained bombing campaign began on 24 August with the largest raid so far, killing 100 in Portsmouth, and that night, several areas of London were bombed; the East End was set ablaze and bombs landed on central London. Some historians believe that these bombs were dropped accidentally by a group of Heinkel He 111s which had failed to find their target; this account has been contested.[216]\nMore night raids were made around London on 24/25 August, when bombs fell on Croydon, Banstead, Lewisham, Uxbridge, Harrow and Hayes. London was on red alert over the night of 28/29 August, with bombs reported in Finchley, St Pancras, Wembley, Wood Green, Southgate, Old Kent Road, Mill Hill, Ilford, Chigwell and Hendon.[131]\nG\u00c3\u00b6ring's directive issued on 23 August 1940 ordered ceaseless attacks on the aircraft industry and on RAF ground organisation to force the RAF to use its fighters, continuing the tactic of luring them up to be destroyed, and added that focussed attacks were to be made on RAF airfields.[216]\nFrom 24 August onwards, the battle was a fight between Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 and Park's 11 Group. The Luftwaffe concentrated all their strength on knocking out Fighter Command and made repeated attacks on the airfields. Of the 33 heavy attacks in the following two weeks, 24 were against airfields. The key sector stations were hit repeatedly: Biggin Hill and Hornchurch four times each; Debden and North Weald twice each. Croydon, Gravesend, Rochford, Hawkinge and Manston were also attacked in strength. Coastal Command's Eastchurch was bombed at least seven times because it was believed to be a Fighter Command aerodrome. At times these raids caused some damage to the sector stations, threatening the integrity of the Dowding system.\nTo offset some losses, some 58 Fleet Air Arm fighter pilot volunteers were seconded to RAF squadrons, and a similar number of former Fairey Battle pilots were used. Most replacements from Operational Training Units (OTUs) had as little as nine hours flying time and no gunnery or air-to-air combat training. At this point, the multinational nature of Fighter Command came to the fore. Many squadrons and personnel from the air forces of the Dominions were already attached to the RAF, including top level commanders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, Rhodesians and South Africans. In addition, there were other nationalities represented, including Free French, Belgian and a Jewish pilot from the British mandate of Palestine.\nThey were bolstered by the arrival of fresh Czechoslovak and Polish squadrons. These had been held back by Dowding, who mistakenly thought non-English speaking aircrew would have trouble working within his control system: Polish and Czech fliers proved to be especially effective. The pre-war Polish Air Force had lengthy and extensive training, and high standards; with Poland conquered and under brutal German occupation, the pilots of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, the highest-scoring Allied unit,[217] were strongly motivated. Josef Franti\u0161ek, a Czech regular airman who had flown from the occupation of his own country to join the Polish and then French air forces before arriving in Britain, flew as a guest of 303 Squadron and was ultimately credited with the highest \"RAF score\" in the Battle of Britain.[218]\nThe RAF had the advantage of fighting over home territory. Pilots who bailed out of their downed aircraft could be back at their airfields within hours, while if low on fuel and/or ammunition they could be immediately rearmed.[219] One RAF pilot interviewed in late 1940 had been shot down five times during the Battle of Britain, but was able to crash land in Britain or bail out each time.[220] For Luftwaffe aircrews, a bailout over England meant capture \u2013 in the critical August period, almost exactly as many Luftwaffe pilots were taken prisoner as were killed[221] \u2013 while parachuting into the English Channel often meant drowning or death from exposure. Morale began to suffer, and [Kanalkrankheit] (\"Channel sickness\") \u2013 a form of combat fatigue \u2013 began to appear among the German pilots. Their replacement problem became even worse than the British.\nThe effect of the German attacks on airfields is unclear. According to Stephen Bungay, Dowding, in a letter to Hugh Trenchard[222] accompanying Park's report on the period 8 August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 September 1940, states that the Luftwaffe \"achieved very little\" in the last week of August and the first week of September.[223] The only Sector Station to be shut down operationally was Biggin Hill, and it was non-operational for just two hours. Dowding admitted 11 Group's efficiency was impaired but, despite serious damage to some airfields, only two out of 13 heavily attacked airfields were down for more than a few hours. The German refocus on London was not critical.[223]\nRetired air marshal Peter Dye, head of the RAF Museum, discussed the logistics of the battle in 2000[224] and 2010,[225] dealing specifically with the single-seat fighters. Dye contends that not only was British aircraft production replacing aircraft, but replacement pilots were keeping pace with losses. The number of pilots in RAF Fighter Command increased during July, August and September. The figures indicate the number of pilots available never decreased: from July, 1,200 were available, and from 1 August, 1,400 were available. Just over that number were in the field by September. In October the figure was nearly 1,600. By 1 November 1,800 were available. Throughout the battle, the RAF had more fighter pilots available than the Luftwaffe.[224][225] Although the RAF's reserves of single seat fighters fell during July, the wastage was made up for by an efficient Civilian Repair Organisation (CRO), which by December had repaired and put back into service some 4,955 aircraft,[226] and by aircraft held at Air Servicing Unit (ASU) airfields.[227]\nRichard Overy agrees with Dye and Bungay. Overy asserts only one airfield was temporarily put out of action and \"only\" 103 pilots were lost. British fighter production produced 496 new aircraft in July and 467 in August, and another 467 in September (not counting repaired aircraft), covering the losses of August and September. Overy indicates the number of serviceable and total strength returns reveal an increase in fighters from 3 August to 7 September, 1,061 on strength and 708 serviceable to 1,161 on strength and 746 serviceable.[228] Moreover, Overy points out that the number of RAF fighter pilots grew by one-third between June and August 1940. Personnel records show a constant supply of around 1,400 pilots in the crucial weeks of the battle. In the second half of September it reached 1,500. The shortfall of pilots was never above 10%. The Germans never had more than between 1,100 and 1,200 pilots, a deficiency of up to one-third. \"If Fighter Command were 'the few', the German fighter pilots were fewer\".[229]\nOther scholars assert that this period was the most dangerous of all. In The Narrow Margin, published in 1961, historians Derek Wood and Derek Dempster believed that the two weeks from 24 August to 6 September represented a real danger. According to them, from 24 August to 6 September 295 fighters had been totally destroyed and 171 badly damaged, against a total output of 269 new and repaired Spitfires and Hurricanes. They assert that 103 pilots were killed or missing and 128 were wounded, which represented a total wastage of 120 pilots per week out of a fighting strength of just fewer than 1,000. They conclude that during August no more than 260 fighter pilots were turned out by OTUs and casualties in the same month were just over 300. A full squadron establishment was 26 pilots whereas the average in August was 16. In their assessment, the RAF was losing the battle.[230] Denis Richards, in his 1953 contribution to the official British account History of the Second World War, agreed that lack of pilots, especially experienced ones, was the RAF's greatest problem. He states that between 8 and 18 August 154 RAF pilots were killed, severely wounded, or missing, while only 63 new pilots were trained. Availability of aircraft was also a serious issue. While its reserves during the Battle of Britain never declined to a half dozen planes as some later claimed, Richards describes 24 August to 6 September as the critical period because during these two weeks Germany destroyed far more aircraft through its attacks on 11 Group's southeast bases than Britain was producing. Three more weeks of such a pace would indeed have exhausted aircraft reserves. Germany had seen heavy losses of pilots and aircraft as well however, thus its shift to night-time attacks in September. On 7 September RAF aircraft losses fell below British production and remained so until the end of the war.[231]\nHitler's \"Directive No. 17 \u2013 For the conduct of air and sea warfare against England\" issued on 1 August 1940, reserved to himself the right to decide on terror attacks as measures of reprisal.[58] Hitler issued a directive that London was not to be bombed save on his sole instruction.[232] In preparation, detailed target plans under the code name Operation Loge for raids on communications, power stations, armaments works and docks in the Port of London were distributed to the Fliegerkorps in July. The port areas were crowded next to residential housing and civilian casualties would be expected, but this would combine military and economic targets with indirect effects on morale. The strategy agreed on 6 August was for raids on military and economic targets in towns and cities to culminate in a major attack on London.[233] In mid August raids were made on targets on the outskirts of London.[216]\nLuftwaffe doctrine included the possibility of retaliatory attacks on cities, and since 11 May small scale night raids by RAF Bomber Command had frequently bombed residential areas. The Germans assumed this was deliberate, and as the raids increased in frequency and scale the population grew impatient for measures of revenge.[233] On 25 August 1940, 81 bombers of Bomber Command were sent out to raid industrial and commercial targets in Berlin. Clouds prevented accurate identification and the bombs fell across the city, causing some casualties among the civilian population as well as damage to residential areas.[234] Continuing RAF raids on Berlin led to Hitler withdrawing his directive on 30 August,[235] and giving the go-ahead to the planned bombing offensive.[233] On 3 September G\u00f6ring planned to bomb London daily, with General Albert Kesselring's enthusiastic support, having received reports the average strength of RAF squadrons was down to five or seven fighters out of twelve and their airfields in the area were out of action. Hitler issued a directive on 5 September to attack cities including London.[236][237] In his widely publicised speech delivered on 4 September 1940, Hitler condemned the bombing of Berlin and presented the planned attacks on London as reprisals. The first daylight raid was titled Vergeltungsangriff (revenge attack).[238]\nOn 7 September, a massive series of raids involving nearly four hundred bombers and more than six hundred fighters targeted docks in the East End of London, day and night. The RAF anticipated attacks on airfields and 11 Group rose to meet them, in greater numbers than the Luftwaffe expected. The first official deployment of 12 Group's Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing took twenty minutes to form up, missing its intended target, but encountering another formation of bombers while still climbing. They returned, apologetic about their limited success, and blamed the delay on being scrambled too late.[239][240]\nThe German press jubilantly announced that \"one great cloud of smoke stretches tonight from the middle of London to the mouth of the Thames.\" Reports reflected the briefings given to crews before the raids \u2013 \"Everyone knew about the last cowardly attacks on German cities, and thought about wives, mothers and children. And then came that word 'Vengeance!'\" Pilots reported seeing ruined airfields as they flew towards London, appearances which gave intelligence reports the impression of devastated defences. G\u00f6ring maintained that the RAF was close to defeat, making invasion feasible.[241]\nFighter Command had been at its lowest ebb, short of men and machines, and the break from airfield attacks allowed them to recover. 11 Group had considerable success in breaking up daytime raids. 12 Group repeatedly disobeyed orders and failed to meet requests to protect 11 Group airfields, but their experiments with increasingly large Big Wings had some success. The Luftwaffe began to abandon their morning raids, with attacks on London starting late in the afternoon for fifty-seven consecutive nights.[242]\nThe most damaging aspect to the Luftwaffe of targeting London was the increase in range. The Bf 109E escorts had a limited fuel capacity resulting in only a 660\u00a0km (410 mile) maximum range solely on internal fuel,[243] and when they arrived had only 10 minutes of flying time before turning for home, leaving the bombers undefended by fighter escorts. Its eventual stablemate, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A, was flying only in prototype form in the summer of 1940; the first 28 Fw 190s were not delivered until November 1940. The Fw 190A-1 had a maximum range of 940\u00a0km (584 miles) on internal fuel, 40% greater than the Bf 109E.[244] The Messerschmitt Bf 109E-7 corrected this deficiency by adding a ventral centre-line ordnance rack to take either an SC 250 bomb or a standard 300 litre Luftwaffe drop tank to double the range to 1,325\u00a0km (820\u00a0mi). The ordnance rack was not retrofitted to earlier Bf 109Es until October 1940.\nOn 14 September, Hitler chaired a meeting with the OKW staff. G\u00c3\u00b6ring was in France directing the decisive battle, so Erhard Milch deputised for him.[245] Hitler asked \"Should we call it off altogether?\" General Hans Jeschonnek, Luftwaffe Chief of Staff, begged for a last chance to defeat the RAF and for permission to launch attacks on civilian residential areas to cause mass panic. Hitler refused the latter, perhaps unaware of how much damage had already been done to civilian targets. He reserved for himself the power to unleash the terror weapon. Instead political will was to be broken by destroying the material infrastructure, the weapons industry, and stocks of fuel and food.\nOn 15 September, two massive waves of German attacks were decisively repulsed by the RAF by deploying every aircraft in 11 Group. Sixty German and twenty-six RAF aircraft were shot down. The action was the climax of the Battle of Britain.[246]\nTwo days after the German defeat Hitler postponed preparations for the invasion of Britain. Henceforth, in the face of mounting losses in men, aircraft and the lack of adequate replacements, the Luftwaffe completed their gradual shift from daylight bomber raids and continued with nighttime bombing. 15 September is commemorated as Battle of Britain Day.\nAt the 14 September OKW conference, Hitler acknowledged that the Luftwaffe had still not gained the air superiority needed for the Operation Sealion invasion. In agreement with Raeder's written recommendation, Hitler said the campaign was to intensify regardless of invasion plans: \"The decisive thing is the ceaseless continuation of air attacks.\" Jeschonnek proposed attacking residential areas to cause \"mass panic\", but Hitler turned this down: he reserved to himself the option of terror bombing. British morale was to be broken by destroying infrastructure, armaments manufacturing, fuel and food stocks. On 16 September, G\u00f6ring gave the order for this change in strategy.[59] This new phase was to be the first independent strategic bombing campaign, in hopes of a political success forcing the British to give up.[60] Hitler hoped it might result in \"eight million going mad\" (referring to the population of London in 1940), which would \"cause a catastrophe\" for the British. In those circumstances, Hitler said, \"even a small invasion might go a long way\". Hitler was against cancelling the invasion as \"the cancellation would reach the ears of the enemy and strengthen his resolve\".[nb 18][nb 19] On 19 September, Hitler ordered a reduction in work on Sealion.[248] He doubted if strategic bombing could achieve its aims, but ending the air war would be an open admission of defeat. He had to maintain the appearance of concentration on defeating Britain, to conceal from Joseph Stalin his covert aim to invade the Soviet Union.[249]\nThroughout the battle, most Luftwaffe bombing raids had been at night.[250] They increasingly suffered unsustainable losses in daylight raids, and the last massive daytime attacks were on 15 September. A raid of 70 bombers on 18 September also suffered badly, and day raids were gradually phased out leaving the main attacks at night. Fighter command still lacked any successful way of intercepting night-time raiders, the night fighter force was mostly Blenheims and Beaufighters, and lacked airborne radar so had no way of finding the bombers. Anti-aircraft guns were diverted to London's defences, but had a much reduced success rate against night attacks.[251]\nFrom mid September, Luftwaffe daylight bombing was gradually taken over by a Bf 109 fighters, adapted to take one 250\u00a0kg bomb. Small groups of fighter-bombers would carry out St\u00f6rangriffe raids escorted by large escort formations of about 200 to 300 combat fighters. They flew at altitudes over 20,000 feet (6,100\u00a0m) where the Bf109 had an advantage over RAF fighters, except the Spitfire.[nb 20][nb 21][254] The raids disturbed civilians, and continued the war of attrition against Fighter Command. The raids were intended to carry out precision bombing on military or economic targets, but it was hard to achieve sufficient accuracy with the single bomb. Sometimes, when attacked, the fighter-bombers had to jettison the bomb to function as fighters. The RAF was at a disadvantage, and changed defensive tactics by introducing standing patrols of Spitfires at high altitude to monitor incoming raids. On a sighting, other patrols at lower altitude would fly up to join the battle.[255][249]\nA Junkers Ju 88 returning from a raid on London was shot down in Kent on 27 September resulting in the Battle of Graveney Marsh, the last action between British and foreign military forces on British mainland soil.[256]\nGerman bombing of Britain reached its peak in October and November 1940. In post war interrogation, Wilhelm Keitel described the aims as economic blockade, in conjunction with submarine warfare, and attrition of Britain's military and economic resources. The Luftwaffe wanted to achieve victory on its own, and was reluctant to cooperate with the navy. Their strategy for blockade was to destroy ports and storage facilities in towns and cities. Priorities were based on the pattern of trade and distribution, so for these months London was the main target. In November their attention turned to other ports and industrial targets around Britain.[257]\nHitler postponed the Sealion invasion on 13 October \"until the spring of 1941\". It was not until Hitler's Directive 21 was issued, on 18 December 1940, that the threat to Britain of invasion finally ended.[187]\nDuring the battle, and for the rest of the war, an important factor in keeping public morale high was the continued presence in London of King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth. When war broke out in 1939, the King and Queen decided to stay in London and not flee to Canada, as had been suggested.[nb 22] George VI and Elizabeth officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they often spent weekends at Windsor Castle to visit their daughters, Elizabeth (the future queen) and Margaret.[258] Buckingham Palace was damaged by bombs which landed in the grounds on 10 September and, on 13 September, more serious damage was caused by two bombs which destroyed the Royal Chapel. The royal couple were in a small sitting room about 80 yards from where the bombs exploded.[259][260] On 24 September, in recognition of the bravery of civilians, King George VI inaugurated the award of the George Cross.\nOverall, by 2 November, the RAF fielded 1,796 pilots, an increase of over 40% from July 1940's count of 1,259 pilots.[261] Based on German sources (from a Luftwaffe intelligence officer Otto Bechtle attached to KG 2 in February 1944) translated by the Air Historical Branch, Stephen Bungay asserts German fighter and bomber \"strength\" declined without recovery, and that from August\u2013December 1940, the German fighter and bomber strength declined by 30 and 25 percent.[8] In contrast, Williamson Murray, argues (using translations by the Air Historical Branch) that 1,380 German bombers were on strength on 29 June 1940,[6][262] 1,420 bombers on 28 September,[263] 1,423 level bombers on 2 November[264] and 1,393 bombers on 30 November 1940.[264] In July\u2013September the number of Luftwaffe pilots available fell by 136, but the number of operational pilots had shrunk by 171 by September. The training organisation of the Luftwaffe was failing to replace losses. German fighter pilots, in contrast to popular perception, were not afforded training or rest rotations unlike their British counterparts.[115] The first week of September accounted for 25% of the Fighter Command, and 24% of the Luftwaffe's overall losses.[265] Between the dates 26 August \u2013 6 September, on only one day (1 September) did the Germans destroy more aircraft than they lost. Losses were 325 German and 248 British.[266]\nLuftwaffe losses for August numbered 774 aircraft to all causes, representing 18.5% of all combat aircraft at the beginning of the month.[267] Fighter Command's losses in August were 426 fighters destroyed,[268] amounting to 40 per cent of 1,061 fighters available on 3 August.[269] In addition, 99 German bombers and 27 other types were destroyed between 1 and 29 August.[270]\nFrom July to September, the Luftwaffe's loss records indicate the loss of 1,636 aircraft, 1,184 to enemy action.[262] This represented 47% of the initial strength of single-engined fighters, 66% of twin-engined fighters, and 45% of bombers. This indicates the Germans were running out of aircrew as well as aircraft.[271]\nThroughout the battle, the Germans greatly underestimated the size of the RAF and the scale of British aircraft production. Across the Channel, the Air Intelligence division of the Air Ministry consistently overestimated the size of the German air enemy and the productive capacity of the German aviation industry. As the battle was fought, both sides exaggerated the losses inflicted on the other by an equally large margin. However, the intelligence picture formed before the battle encouraged the Luftwaffe to believe that such losses pushed Fighter Command to the very edge of defeat, while the exaggerated picture of German air strength persuaded the RAF that the threat it faced was larger and more dangerous than was the case.[272] This led the British to the conclusion that another fortnight of attacks on airfields might force Fighter Command to withdraw their squadrons from the south of England. The German misconception, on the other hand, encouraged first complacency, then strategic misjudgement. The shift of targets from air bases to industry and communications was taken because it was assumed that Fighter Command was virtually eliminated.[273]\nBetween 24 August and 4 September, German serviceability rates, which were acceptable at Stuka units, were running at 75% with Bf 109s, 70% with bombers and 65% with Bf 110s, indicating a shortage of spare parts. All units were well below established strength. The attrition was beginning to affect the fighters in particular.\"[274] By 14 September, the Luftwaffe's Bf 109 Geschwader possessed only 67% of their operational crews against authorised aircraft. For Bf 110 units it was 46 per cent; and for bombers it was 59 per cent. A week later the figures had dropped to 64 per cent, 52% and 52 per cent.[271] Serviceability rates in Fighter Command's fighter squadrons, between 24 August and 7 September, were listed as: 64.8% on 24 August; 64.7% on 31 August and 64.25% on 7 September 1940.[269]\nDue to the failure of the Luftwaffe to establish air supremacy, a conference assembled on 14 September at Hitler's headquarters. Hitler concluded that air superiority had not yet been established and \"promised to review the situation on 17 September for possible landings on 27 September or 8 October. Three days later, when the evidence was clear that the German Air Force had greatly exaggerated the extent of their successes against the RAF, Hitler postponed Sea Lion indefinitely.\"[275]\nPropaganda was an important element of the air war which began to develop over Britain from 18 June 1940 onwards, when the Luftwaffe began small, probing daylight raids to test RAF defences. One of many examples of these small-scale raids was the destruction of a school at Polruan in Cornwall, by a single raider. Into early July, the British media's focus on the air battles increased steadily, the press, magazines, BBC radio and newsreels daily conveying the contents of Air Ministry communiques.[276] The German OKW communiques matched Britain's efforts in claiming for the upper hand.[277]\nCentral to the propaganda war on both sides of the Channel were aircraft claims, this discussed under 'Attrition statistics'. These daily claims were important both for sustaining British home front morale and persuading America to support Britain, and were produced by the Air Ministry's Air Intelligence branch. Under pressure from American journalists and broadcasters to prove that the RAF's claims were genuine, RAF intelligence compared pilots' claims with actual aircraft wrecks and those seen to crash into the sea. It was soon realised that there was a discrepancy between the two, but the Air Ministry decided not to reveal this.[278] In fact, it was not until May 1947 that the actual figures were released to the public, by which time it was of far less importance. Many though refused to believe the revised figures, including Douglas Bader.[279]\nThe place of the Battle of Britain in British popular memory is due in no small part to the successful propaganda campaign waged by the Air Ministry, between July\u00e2\u20ac\u201cOctober 1940, but also in valorising the Few from March 1941 onwards. The publication of the immensely successful 3d pamphlet, The Battle of Britain, saw huge international sales, leading even Goebbels to admire its propaganda value. Focusing only upon the Few, with no mention of RAF bomber attacks against invasion barges, the Battle of Britain was soon established as a major victory for Fighter Command. This in turn inspired a wide range of feature films, books, magazines, works of art, poetry, radio plays and MOI short films.\nIt is notable that this most impressive of British victories had, in essence, been proclaimed within only five months of the cessation of large-scale daylight air battles, and without reference to Hitler and the OKW's reasoning for not proceeding with Operation Sea Lion. The continuing post-war popularity of the Battle of Britain is in fact directly attributable to the Air Ministry's latter-1940 air communiques, the media in turn broadcasting or publishing RAF aircraft claims. Noted above, this in turn led to the March 1941 pamphlet, which inspired a wide range of cultural responses to the Few, and the Battle of Britain. The Air Ministry built upon this with the development of the Battle of Britain Sunday commemoration, also supported the Battle of Britain clasp for issue to the Few in 1945, and from 1945 Battle of Britain Week. The Battle of Britain window in Westminster Abbey was also encouraged by the Air Ministry, Lords Trenchard and Dowding on its committee. By July 1947 when the window was unveiled, the Battle of Britain had already attained central prominence as Fighter Command's most notable victory, the Few alone credited with preventing invasion in 1940. Although given widespread media coverage in September and October 1940, RAF Bomber and Coastal Command raids against invasion barge concentrations had already been forgotten by war's end.\nThe Battle of Britain marked the first major defeat of Hitler's military forces, with air superiority seen as the key to victory.[280] Pre-war theories had led to exaggerated fears of strategic bombing, and UK public opinion was buoyed by coming through the ordeal.[281] For the RAF, Fighter Command had achieved a great victory in successfully carrying out Sir Thomas Inskip's 1937 air policy of preventing the Germans from knocking Britain out of the war. Churchill concluded his famous 18 June 'Battle of Britain' speech in the House of Commons by referring to pilots and aircrew who fought the Battle: \"...\u00c2\u00a0if the British Empire and its Commonwealth lasts for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'\"[282][nb 23]\nThe battle also significantly shifted American opinion. During the battle, many Americans accepted the view promoted by Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador in London, who believed that the United Kingdom could not survive. Roosevelt wanted a second opinion, and sent \"Wild Bill\" Donovan on a brief visit to the UK; he became convinced the UK would survive and should be supported in every possible way.[283][284] Before the end of the year American journalist Ralph Ingersoll, after returning from Britain, published a book concluding that \"Adolf Hitler met his first defeat in eight years\" in what might \"go down in history as a battle as important as Waterloo or Gettysburg\". The turning point was when the Germans reduced the intensity of the Blitz after 15 September. According to Ingersoll, \"[a] majority of responsible British officers who fought through this battle believe that if Hitler and G\u00c3\u00b6ring had had the courage and the resources to lose 200 planes a day for the next five days, nothing could have saved London\"; instead, \"[the Luftwaffe's] morale in combat is definitely broken, and the RAF has been gaining in strength each week.\"[285]\nBoth sides in the battle made exaggerated claims of numbers of enemy aircraft shot down. In general, claims were two to three times the actual numbers, because of the confusion of fighting in dynamic three-dimensional air battles. Postwar analysis of records has shown that between July and September, the RAF claimed 2,698 kills, while the Luftwaffe fighters claimed 3,198 RAF aircraft downed.[citation needed] Total losses, and start and end dates for recorded losses, vary for both sides. Luftwaffe losses from 10 July to 30 October 1940 total 1,977 aircraft, including 243 twin- and 569 single-engined fighters, 822 bombers and 343 non combat types.[14] In the same period, RAF Fighter Command aircraft losses number 1,087, including 53 twin-engined fighters.[citation needed] To the RAF figure should be added 376 Bomber Command and 148 Coastal Command aircraft lost conducting bombing, mining, and reconnaissance operations in defence of the country.[8]\nThere is a consensus among historians that the Luftwaffe were unable to crush the RAF. Stephen Bungay described Dowding and Park's strategy of choosing when to engage the enemy whilst maintaining a coherent force as vindicated; their leadership, and the subsequent debates about strategy and tactics, however, had created enmity among RAF senior commanders and both were sacked from their posts in the immediate aftermath of the battle.[286] All things considered, the RAF proved to be a robust and capable organisation which was to use all the modern resources available to it to the maximum advantage.[287] Richard Evans wrote:\nIrrespective of whether Hitler was really set on this course, he simply lacked the resources to establish the air superiority that was the sine qua non-of a successful crossing of the English Channel. A third of the initial strength of the German air force, the Luftwaffe, had been lost in the western campaign in the spring. The Germans lacked the trained pilots, the effective fighter aircraft, and the heavy bombers that would have been needed.[288][nb 24]\nThe Germans launched some spectacular attacks against important British industries, but they could not destroy the British industrial potential, and made little systematic effort to do so. Hindsight does not disguise the fact the threat to Fighter Command was very real, and for the participants it seemed as if there was a narrow margin between victory and defeat. Nevertheless, even if the German attacks on the 11 Group airfields which guarded southeast England and the approaches to London had continued, the RAF could have withdrawn to the Midlands out of German fighter range and continued the battle from there.[290] The victory was as much psychological as physical. Writes Alfred Price:\nThe truth of the matter, borne out by the events of 18 August is more prosaic: neither by attacking the airfields, nor by attacking London, was the Luftwaffe likely to destroy Fighter Command. Given the size of the British fighter force and the general high quality of its equipment, training and morale, the Luftwaffe could have achieved no more than a Pyrrhic victory. During the action on 18 August it had cost the Luftwaffe five trained aircrew killed, wounded or taken prisoner, for each British fighter pilot killed or wounded; the ratio was similar on other days in the battle. And this ratio of 5:1 was very close to that between the number of German aircrew involved in the battle and those in Fighter Command. In other words the two sides were suffering almost the same losses in trained aircrew, in proportion to their overall strengths. In the Battle of Britain, for the first time during the Second World War, the German war machine had set itself a major task which it patently failed to achieve, and so demonstrated that it was not invincible. In stiffening the resolve of those determined to resist Hitler the battle was an important turning point in the conflict.[291]\nThe British victory in the Battle of Britain was achieved at a heavy cost. Total British civilian losses from July to December 1940 were 23,002 dead and 32,138 wounded, with one of the largest single raids on 19 December 1940, in which almost 3,000 civilians died. With the culmination of the concentrated daylight raids, Britain was able to rebuild its military forces and establish itself as an Allied stronghold, later serving as a base from which the Liberation of Western Europe was launched.[23]\nWinston Churchill summed up the effect of the battle and the contribution of RAF Fighter Command, RAF Bomber Command, RAF Coastal Command and the Fleet Air Arm with the words, \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\".[292] Pilots who fought in the battle have been known as The Few ever since; at times being specially commemorated on 15 September, \"Battle of Britain Day\". On this day in 1940, the Luftwaffe embarked on their largest bombing attack yet, forcing the engagement of the entirety of the RAF in defence of London and the South East, which resulted in a decisive British victory that proved to mark a turning point in Britain's favour.[293][294]\nWithin the Commonwealth, Battle of Britain Day has been observed more usually on the third Sunday in September, and even on the 2nd Thursday in September in some areas in the British Channel Islands.\nThe day has been observed by many artists over the years, often with works that show the battle itself. Many mixed media artists have also created pieces in honour of the Battle of Britain.[295]\nPlans for the Battle of Britain window in Westminster Abbey were begun during wartime, the committee chaired by Lords Trenchard and Dowding. Public donations paid for the window itself, this officially opened by King George VI on 10 July 1947. Although not actually an 'official' memorial to the Battle of Britain in the sense that government paid for it, the window and chapel have since been viewed as such. During the late 1950s and 1960, various proposals were advanced for a national monument to the Battle of Britain, this also the focus of several letters in The Times. In 1960 the Conservative government decided against a further monument, taking the view that the credit should be shared more broadly than Fighter Command alone, and there was little public appetite for one. All subsequent memorials are the result of private subscription and initiative, as discussed below.[296]\nThere are numerous memorials to the battle. The most important ones are the Battle of Britain Monument in London and the Battle of Britain Memorial at Capel-le-Ferne in Kent. Westminster Abbey and St James's Church, Paddington both have memorial windows to the battle, replacing windows that were destroyed during the campaign. There is also a memorial at the former Croydon Airport, one of the RAF bases during the battle, and a memorial to the pilots at Armadale Castle on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, which is topped by a raven sculpture.\nThere are also two museums to the battle: one at Hawkinge in Kent and one at Stanmore in London, at the former RAF Bentley Priory.[297]\nIn 2015 the RAF created an online 'Battle of Britain 75th Anniversary Commemorative Mosaic' composed of pictures of \"the few\" \u2013 the pilots and aircrew who fought in the battle \u2013 and \"the many\" \u2013 'the often unsung others whose contribution during the Battle of Britain was also vital to the RAF's victory in the skies above Britain', submitted by participants and their families.[298]\nVictoria Embankment, London\nCapel-le-Ferne, Kent\nSt James's Church, Paddington\nMonument of Polish Pilots, Northolt\nThe battle was the subject of the 1969 film Battle of Britain. The cast included Laurence Olivier as Hugh Dowding and Trevor Howard as Keith Park.[299] It also starred Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer and Robert Shaw as Squadron Leaders.[299] Former participants of the battle served as technical advisors including Douglas Bader, Adolf Galland and Hugh Dowding. An Italian film around the same time entitled Eagles Over London (1969) also featured the Battle of Britain. The 1988 ITV mini-series Piece of Cake, an aerial drama about a fictional Second World War RAF fighter squadron in 1940, features the battle. The Czech film Dark Blue World (2001) also featured the battle, focusing on the Czech pilots who fought in the battle. A fictional version of the battle is shown in the 2001 movie, Pearl Harbor, in which the battle is depicted as still going on into 1941.[citation needed]\nIt has also been the subject of many documentaries, including the 1941 Allied propaganda film Churchill's Island, winner of the first Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject.[300][301] There was also the 1943 The Battle of Britain in Frank Capra's Why We Fight series. It was included in an episode of 2004 BBC television documentary series Battlefield Britain. In 2010, actor Julian Glover played a 101-year-old Polish veteran RAF pilot in the short film Battle for Britain.[302]\nThe Few, a novel by Alex Kershaw, tells the stories of the men who flew in the Battle of Britain. As of 2003[update], a Hollywood film similarly named The Few was in preparation for release in 2008, based on the story of real-life US pilot Billy Fiske, who ignored his country's neutrality rules and volunteered for the RAF. A Variety magazine outline of the film's historical content[303] was said in The Independent to have been described by Bill Bond, who conceived the Battle of Britain Monument in London, as \"Totally wrong. The whole bloody lot.\"[304] The project was later cancelled.",

        "text": "Charmed is an American television series created by Constance M. Burge and produced by Aaron Spelling and his production company Spelling Television, with Brad Kern serving as showrunner. The series was originally broadcast by The WB for eight seasons from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006. The series narrative follows a trio of sisters, known as The Charmed Ones, the most powerful good witches of all time, who use their combined \"Power of Three\" to protect innocent lives from evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to maintain normal lives in modern-day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series. The series initially focuses on the three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano). Following Prue's death in the third-season finale, their long-lost half sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan) assumes her place within the \"Power of Three\" from season four onwards.\nCharmed achieved a cult following[1][2] and popularity on The WB with its first episode \"Something Wicca This Way Comes\" garnering 7.7\u00c2\u00a0million viewers, breaking the record for the network's highest-rated debut episode.[3] The show's ratings, although smaller than rival shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB network. Charmed went through several timeslot changes during its eight-season run. For its first three seasons in the Wednesday/Thursday 9:00 pm timeslot, Charmed was the second-highest rated series on The WB, behind 7th Heaven.[4] During its fifth season, the show moved to the Sunday 8:00 pm timeslot, where it became the highest-rated Sunday night program in The WB's history.[5][6] At 178 episodes, Charmed was the second-longest drama broadcast by The WB, behind the 10 seasons and 221 episodes The WB aired of 7th Heaven. In 2006, it became the longest running hour-long television series featuring all female leads, before being surpassed by Desperate Housewives in 2012.[7]\nThe series has also received numerous awards and nominations. In 2010, The Huffington Post and AOL TV ranked Charmed within their joint list of \"The Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time,\" while in 2013, TV Guide listed the series as one of \"The 60 Greatest Sci-Fi Shows of All Time.\" Charmed has also become a source of pop culture references in film and television and has influenced other succeeding television series in the same subgenre. The show's success has led to its development in other media, including a video game, board games, soundtracks, novels, and a comic book series which served as a continuation of its narrative. In 2012, six years after it ceased broadcasting, Charmed was the second-most binge watched television series on subscription video-on-demand services Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and Hulu Plus.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201dPhoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano) in \"Something Wicca This Way Comes\"\nThe series starts when Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano) returns from New York and moves back into the family's Halliwell Manor in San Francisco to live with her sisters Prue (Shannen Doherty) and Piper (Holly Marie Combs). When Phoebe discovers the family's Book of Shadows in the attic, she learns that she and her sisters are the most powerful witches ever known, destined to protect both innocents and the world at large from demons, warlocks, and other evil creatures. Phoebe, reasonably suspecting the book to be a novelty, reads its initial inscription\u00e2\u20ac\u201dunaware that it also happens to be an incantation activating the sisters' supernatural powers once all three are reunited in their ancestral home.\nBy the end of the first episode, each sister learns that she has a unique magical power and that they can each cast spells and brew potions. Prue, the eldest, has the power of telekinesis (the ability to move objects with her mind), and in season two she develops the power of astral projection (the ability to be in two places at once). Piper, the middle sister, has the power to effectively \"freeze\" people and objects in time. As she grows more proficient, she learns how to freeze only certain people or objects or body parts, as she wishes. In season three, her powers evolve further, as she is able to cause evil beings or objects to explode using her hands. Phoebe, the youngest of the three, initially possesses the power of premonition allowing her to receive visions of the future and later of the past. She later develops the powers of levitation in season three, and empathy in season six, the latter allowing her to sense and tap into others' emotions and, sometimes, powers. In accordance with the series' mythology, witches' powers are tied to their emotions.\nDuring the first two seasons, the sisters face various evil beings from week to week. However, in the third season, they discover that their ultimate enemy is The Underworld's demonic ruler, The Source of All Evil. Eventually, Prue is killed in the season three finale by The Source's personal assassin, Shax (Michael Bailey Smith). While grieving for their older sister, Piper and Phoebe discover that they also have a younger half-sister, Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan), who had been the secret love child of their witch mother, Patty (Finola Hughes), and her whitelighter (guardian angel) Sam Wilder (Scott Jaeck). Paige's magical abilities represent her dual heritage as both a witch and whitelighter; like Prue, she possesses a form of telekinesis, but she has to verbally call for objects to orb (or, teleport) them to their intended destination. As she attempts to control the two sides of her ancestry, Paige also learns how to orb herself and others, and to heal others with the touch of her hand; she eventually receives her own whitelighter charges to train and protect as they learn witchcraft.\nThe Source, responsible for the majority of attacks on the sisters, becomes the main villain during season four until he is finally vanquished. After his demise, an annual season-long storyline and several antagonists are introduced in subsequent seasons (occasionally following the \"Big Bad\" television format). These include Phoebe's demonic ex-husband, Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), until mid-season five; the scheming, misguided Elder, Gideon (Gildart Jackson), throughout season six; The Avatars until mid-season seven; the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) until the season seven finale; and, in season eight, powerful sister witches Billie (Kaley Cuoco) and Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson), who fall under the influence of the demonic Triad (who earlier feature as early-season three antagonists). In addition to the supernatural themes explored in Charmed, the characters contend with serious issues in their day-to-day lives such as relationships, careers, marriage, childbirth, illness and the deaths of loved ones. The sisters also fight to prevent the exposure of the existence of magic to the human community at large, contending with several police and FBI investigations. Often through the assistance of their long-term ally, Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory) of the San Francisco Police Department, they are able to avoid police suspicion, including the investigation of the most-recurring human antagonist, Inspector Sheridan (Jenya Lano), in the sixth and seventh seasons.\nThe sisters also face romantic storylines. Prue's love interests include her high school sweetheart, Inspector Andy Trudeau (Ted King), who dies in the season one finale in an attempt to save the sisters, and a brief co-worker, Jack Sheridan (Lochlyn Munro), in season two. Piper's central love interest throughout the series is the sisters' whitelighter Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause); their early relationship is problematic due to the forbidden nature of witch-whitelighter relationships, and so in season two a love triangle forms with Piper, Leo and her neighbor, Dan Gordon (Greg Vaughan). Eventually, the two manage to marry and consecrate their union in season three, producing a son named Wyatt in season five. The couple separate due to supernatural circumstances at the end of the fifth season; however, they reconnect in the subsequent season, resulting in a second son named Chris. The final episode of Charmed shows them to have a daughter, many grandchildren, and to grow old together in the future. Phoebe's romantic history involves a tortured relationship with half-demon Cole Turner in the show's third, fourth and fifth seasons; they have a turbulent marriage in the fourth, and in the fifth, following their divorce, she is compelled to vanquish him. Phoebe has a number of multi-episode human boyfriends in subsequent seasons, including her boss, Jason Dean (Eric Dane), before meeting a cupid named Coop (Victor Webster) in the eighth season, whom she marries. Paige, like Phoebe, has several multi-episode boyfriends, including fellow-witch and magic \"addict\" Richard Montana (Balthazar Getty) in season six, and an unstable FBI agent-turned-whitelighter Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith) in season seven. In the eighth season, she becomes committed to a human parole officer, Henry Mitchell (Ivan Sergei), whom she marries. The final episode's flashforward montage reveals Piper, Phoebe, and Paige to have three children each with their respective husbands.\nIn 1998, when The WB began looking for a new drama series for the 1998\u201399 season, they approached Spelling Television (which had produced the network's then-most successful series, 7th Heaven) to create it. Expanding on the popularity of supernatural-themed dramas such as The Craft (1996)[8][9] and Practical Magic (1998),[10] the production company explored different forms of mythology to find characters they could realize with contemporary storytelling.[11]\nConstance M. Burge was hired to create the series as she was under contract with 20th Century Fox and Spelling Television after conceiving the drama series Savannah (1996\u00e2\u20ac\u201c97).[11] When the theme of witchcraft was first pitched to her, she was aware of stereotypes of witches (flying brooms, black cats, and warts). After researching Wicca, she changed her perspective[12] and aimed at telling a story of good witches who looked and acted like ordinary people. With this, her initial concept was a series set in Boston, Massachusetts[12] about three friends and roommates who were all witches.[11] However, executive producer E. Duke Vincent lacked confidence, asking \"Why would anybody want to watch a show about three witches?\" He proposed that the series should focus on family values and developed the series-long mantra of it being about \"three sisters who happen to be witches, not three witches who happen to be sisters.\" Spelling warmed to Burge's ideas and, after the concept was re-crafted to be a series about three sisters (now living in San Francisco) descended from a line of witches,[12] it was pitched to The WB's President of Entertainment, Susanne Daniels, who liked it, allowing the series to begin development.[11]\nThe series was retitled Charmed after Spelling's suggestion of House of Sisters was dropped. Burge wrote the pilot script. A 28-minute version was filmed (the \"unaired pilot,\" never aired on network television) with which the series was picked up by The WB. Upon its debut, Charmed received the largest audience for a series premiere in the network's history.[3] The first season of 22 episodes was picked up by The WB after only two episodes had aired.\nFormer Beverly Hills, 90210 actress Shannen Doherty was cast as the eldest sister Prue Halliwell, while her best friend and former Picket Fences actress Holly Marie Combs played the role of the middle sister Piper Halliwell.[13] Lori Rom was originally cast as the youngest sister Phoebe Halliwell in the 28-minute unaired pilot episode.[13] However, Rom quit the series, and a new pilot was filmed with former Who's the Boss actress Alyssa Milano in the role of Phoebe.[13] Doherty departed Charmed at the end of the third season and was replaced in the fourth season by film actress Rose McGowan, who played the long-lost younger half-sister Paige Matthews.[14]\nIn season one, Ted King was cast as the inspector Andy Trudeau, Dorian Gregory was cast as his inspector partner Darryl Morris, and Brian Krause was cast as the Halliwell sisters' whitelighter Leo Wyatt.[13] King departed Charmed at the end of the first season, while Gregory remained on the show until the seventh season. In season two, Greg Vaughan joined the series as the Halliwell sisters' new next-door neighbor Dan Gordon, while Karis Paige Bryant was cast as his niece Jenny Gordon. Bryant left her role midway through the second season, while Vaughan left at the end of the season. Australian actor Julian McMahon joined the cast of Charmed in season three as the half-demon Cole Turner. He departed the show midway through season five. Drew Fuller joined Charmed at the end of the fifth season as Piper and Leo's second son from the future, Chris Halliwell. Fuller left his role at the end of season six. In the eighth and final season, Kaley Cuoco joined the show as the young witch Billie Jenkins.\nExecutive producers Aaron Spelling and E. Duke Vincent maintained their roles until the series ended. Constance M. Burge became an executive producer when she was hired to create the series and write the pilot. After the short \"unaired pilot\" was shown to The WB and the series was picked up by the network, Brad Kern was recruited as the fourth executive producer and as the show runner in order to decipher how the series would develop over the course of its run. While Kern remained with the show until its end, between the second and third seasons Burge was not an executive producer. She remained as executive consultant until the end of season four when she left Charmed.\nScripting was done by a large number of writers. Brad Kern did the most writing, with a total of 26 episodes, as well as directing one of them. The writers with the most writing credits other than Kern include Daniel Cerone, Curtis Kheel, Zack Estrin, Chris Levinson, Krista Vernoff, Sheryl J. Anderson, Monica Owusu-Breen, Alison Schapker, Cameron Litvack, and Jeannine Renshaw.[15] Constance M. Burge wrote seven episodes for the first and second seasons before leaving her position as executive producer. Scripting was carried out after group brainstorms took place, discussing the events of the episodes, the emotions of the characters, and the mythology involved. Robert Masello, an executive story editor for the series, credits himself as the only demonologist hired for a series, in order to add his experience to the storyline.[16]\nCharmed is the only show that has a licensed fully bonded demonologist, which is me, on staff and as a result because I've written books about demonology and the occult of witchcraft, I'm there to answer questions about how a demon would behave.\nHowever, as Holly Marie Combs revealed in The Women of Charmed documentary, the series aimed at following a mythology created by fantasy, and not adhering to Wiccan rules too closely, for fear of coming under criticism for either not being \"technically correct enough\" or missing the truth completely.[16] Between the second and the third season, Burge left, leaving her former position to executive producer Kern. She remained as creative consultant until season four.[17] Burge's departure resulted in changes in the story structure of the show, from a \"demon of the week\" system to using third or half-season-long story arcs. In addition, more importance was given to the protagonists' personal lives. The serial connection of episodes culminated in the second half of season four. Despite the ratings increasing during season four's final story arc from 4.19 to 4.21, The WB asked Kern to abandon the serial system. This led to the largely episodic structure of season five, and resulted in the two systems being balanced from the sixth season onwards.\nThe first six seasons of Charmed were filmed at Ray-Art Studios in Canoga Park, Los Angeles on four of the studio's sound stages.[18][19][20] After Ray-Arts Studio was sold in 2003,[18] production for Charmed moved to the Paramount Studios lot for seasons seven and eight.[21][22][23] Executive producer Brad Kern revealed that the show's eighth and final season was shot only on the Paramount Studios lot as they could not go out on location anymore due to budget cuts.[24] The Innes House located at 1329 Carroll Avenue in Los Angeles was used as the exterior for the show's fictional Halliwell Manor, and has become popular with tourists over the years.[25][26][27][28]\nThe opening credits for Charmed was used to introduce the main and supporting cast members in each season. It consisted of various scenes from episodes and individual footages of the cast that were mostly updated from season to season.[29][30] The opening began with images of the Golden Gate Bridge and flashing shots of the triquetra symbol in a circle.[31] The show's title card then appeared, featuring the triquetra symbol and Book of Shadows.[31] After the title card shot in the seasons 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 opening, scenes from the pilot episode were shown, which included an overhead view of the sisters casting a spell at a round table and a shot of them coming downstairs.[31] A scene of the sisters reciting a spell was then shown with the word \"starring.\"[31] This was followed by the individual footages and names of each lead actress; Shannen Doherty's appeared first, then Holly Marie Combs' and Alyssa Milano's, followed by the individual footages and names of each supporting cast member.[31] The last few scenes in the opening showed the sisters' cat, a San Francisco cable car, and lastly the sisters walking upstairs into their home, with Doherty's character closing the door using her telekinetic powers.[31]\nFollowing Doherty's departure at the end of season three, the season four opening credits had to be recreated to remove all footage of Doherty and to include her replacement, Rose McGowan.[29] The beginning of the opening remained the same.[29] However, after the title card was shown, scenes were changed to include images of the Golden Gate Bridge, a gargoyle, talisman, scrying crystal, tattoo of the triquetra symbol, and candles.[29] The order in which each lead actresses individual footage and name appeared in the opening was also changed; Milano's was moved up first, McGowan's was put in second, and Combs' was moved down third and listed \"as Piper.\"[29] The last few scenes in the opening were also changed to include a cemetery, exterior shots of the Halliwell Manor, and pages in the Book of Shadows.[29] A five-second opening was used for the two-part premiere episodes of seasons four and five; it featured flashing shots of the triquetra symbol and the show's title in large blue letters.[32][33]\nThe opening theme song used in the television airings of all eight seasons was Love Spit Love's cover version of \"How Soon Is Now?\" by The Smiths.[34][35] The song had previously appeared on the soundtrack of The Craft.[9] In the shortened five-second opening for the two-part premiere episodes of seasons four and five, the song was replaced by instrumental music.[32][33] \"How Soon Is Now?\" was also replaced by hard-rock instrumental music in the season eight DVD because the music license to use it had expired.[35][36] This hard-rock instrumental music was also used in the opening of all eight seasons on Netflix.[37][38]\nThe earlier seasons of Charmed received mostly favorable reviews from television critics, with its first season scoring a Metacritic score of 61 out of 100.[39] During the first season, Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker, speaking on the comparisons between Charmed and rival series, argued: \"spike-heeled where Buffy is fleet-footed, Charmed is Charlie's Angels with an Ouija board.\"[40] As well as the show's action sequences\u2014describing the Halliwells as \"superheroes\"\u2014he noted that the series \"plays up the stars' separate-but-equal charms\" and admired both its \"casting and pop-culture timing.\"[40] Vanessa Thorpe of The Guardian agreed with Alyssa Milano's description of Charmed as \"perfect post-feminist girl-power,\" praising the balance between action and emotion as the \"three sibling sorceresses know mischief, but are accessibly feminine.\"[41] Entertainment Weekly critic Karyn L. Barr labelled Charmed a \"crafty cult classic\" and in her retrospective review of the first season, wrote that it \"remains spellbinding thanks to its proper balance of quirky humor, Buffy-esque drama\" and Shannen Doherty's character Prue.[2] Angelica Bastien of Bustle magazine commended the \"strong female characters\" and felt that the show resembled Xena: Warrior Princess more than Buffy due to its \"mix of drama, wacky humor, intensely layered mythology, and feminism-lite vibe.\"[42]\nDuring the third season, Michael Abernethy of PopMatters praised the \"well-choreographed action sequences, respectable acting\" and \"believable\" sisterly relationship between Milano, Doherty, and Holly Marie Combs.[43] Abernethy credited Charmed as \"more enjoyable than most shows in the good vs evil genre\" largely due to the strength of the performers, and noted that despite the monster of the week format, \"the writers tend to explore the sibling dynamics to keep the show from growing redundant.\"[43] Christel Loar also from PopMatters agreed that \"episodes go beyond the demon-of-the-week formula to tap into the relationships of the characters and their...flaws. Charmed...succeeded by combining sisterhood with the supernatural.\"[44] Loar also claimed that the Halliwells' struggle for normal lives, \"stability, and a sense of self is one of the reasons Charmed strikes such a chord with its viewers.\"[44] The A.V. Club's Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya described the fourth season as \"one of the grimmest seasons of Charmed,\" following Doherty's departure and her character's death \"informing the overall tone.\" Upadhyaya also praised the \"smart decisions\" the writers made of how they introduced a new sister into the series, calling the transition \"Charmed's greatest accomplishment\" that \"opened up whole new avenues for grounded, emotional storytelling.\"[45] During the sixth season, Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly described Charmed as \"a guilty-pleasure fantasy\" that is \"inherently cute and incredibly simple.\"[46] Flynn also praised the comedic acting between Milano, Combs and Rose McGowan, adding that \"selling this kind of comedy takes a certain gameness, and the actresses have got it.\"[46]\nThe latter seasons of Charmed also received a mixed reception from some critics. Bustle's Bastien felt that after Doherty's departure, \"Charmed got pretty bad\" and noted that the show \"lost track of its core theme\" of witchcraft and sisterhood by introducing mystical beings, focusing more on \"soapy plots and the sister's love lives.\"[42] Similarly, BuzzFeed writer Jarett Wieselman agreed that \"After Doherty's exit, Charmed veered into slightly-absurd-yet-no-less-entertaining territory,\" noting that McGowan's addition \"ushered in a wave of increasingly campy episodes.\"[47] The A.V. Club's Upadhyaya felt that the latter seasons \"got too complicated\" and campy by focusing too much on the magic \"and not enough about the themes that grounded the show earlier on.\"[45] Becca James also from The A.V. Club felt that the show \"should have died the same time\" Doherty's character did.[48] Hugh Armitage of Digital Spy believed that Charmed \"began to feel very self-indulgent towards its stars\" in the latter seasons, noting that character-driven storylines were replaced with gimmicks such as the revealing costumes worn by the sisters, particularly Milano's character.[49] Nick Romano of Screen Crush wrote that \"the storylines became wicca ridiculous and the dialogue became too cheesy,\" particularly in season eight.[50] Jon Langmead of PopMatters believed that Charmed \"slipped markedly\" in seasons seven and eight, noting that the final season lost appealing elements such as \"smart casting\" and \"attention to relationship drama\" of the show's earlier seasons.[51] Langmead also disliked the introduction of Kaley Cuoco and Marnette Patterson in the eighth season, and felt that Cuoco was \"consistently painful to watch.\"[51] DVD Verdict's Ryan Keefer also felt that Cuoco joining the show was a \"poor choice\" by the producers, and commented that season eight \"failed to recapture the glory days of the first few seasons.\"[52]\nCharmed has gathered several awards and nominations. The show was nominated for one TV Guide Award,[53] two International Horror Guild Awards,[54] three Teen Choice Awards,[55][56] three Wand Awards[56] and seven RATTY Awards, with Holly Marie Combs winning \"Best Science Fiction Lead Actress\" in 2003.[57] It was also nominated for three Saturn Awards, including one \"Best Network Television Series\" nomination for its first season and two \"Best Actress on Television\" nominations for Shannen Doherty in 1999 and 2000.[56] In 2001, Charmed won a Cable Guide Award in the United Kingdom for \"Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Series.\"[58] The series also won a \"Certificate of Merit\" at the 2003 EDGE Awards for the season four episode \"Muse to My Ears.\"[59]\nIn 2004, Alyssa Milano was nominated for a Spacey Award in Canada for \"Favorite Female TV Character\" and in 2005, she was nominated for \"Favorite Television Actress\" at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.[56][60] That same year, Rose McGowan won the award for \"Favorite Sister\" at the Family Television Awards.[61] Charmed also received recognition for its young guest actors, having been nominated for five Young Artist Awards, with Alex Black winning once for his role in the season four episode \"Lost and Bound.\"[62]\nIn the United States, Charmed premiered on The WB on October 7, 1998 and ended on May 21, 2006.[63][64] The first season aired on

there until its eighth and final season.[64][68] By the end of season eight, Charmed had aired a total of 178 episodes and became the longest running hour-long television series featuring all female leads.[7] Most seasons consisted of 22 episodes, except for the fifth and sixth seasons, which contained 23 episodes, including their double-episode premieres and double-episode finales.\nTNT has aired reruns of Charmed ever since the show ended, with three repeat episodes every weekday morning at 7:00 am, 8:00 am and 9:00 am.[69] Full episodes of Charmed are also available for viewing on TNT's official website.[70] In 2010, WE tv aired two repeat episodes each weeknight at 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm.[71] Subscription video-on-demand service Netflix released the full series in July 2011 via their Instant Streaming Service.[72] In 2012, Charmed was found to be the second-most binge watched television series on Netflix, as well as on other video-on-demand services Amazon Video and Hulu Plus.[73][74]\nIn Australia, Charmed was originally broadcast on Network Ten.[75] Reruns of the series have aired on the Sci Fi Channel[76] and Network Ten's digital channel Eleven.[77] In Austria,

\"Something Wicca This Way Comes\" broke the record for the highest-rated debut episode for The WB, with 7.7\u00c2\u00a0million viewers.[3] The show's ratings, although smaller than rival shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB network. Charmed's premiere in 1998 helped ratings rise for The WB, with TV Guide's Mark Schwed noting that the network's viewing figures were way up than the previous year.[101] For its first three seasons, Charmed was the second-highest rated series on The WB, behind 7th Heaven.[4][102][103] During its fifth season, the series became the highest-rated Sunday night program in The WB's history.[5][6]\nCharmed was the first primetime television show about a coven of witches.[128] Following the broadcast of the season eight episode \"Payback's a Witch\" in January 2006, Charmed became the longest running hour-long series in American television history featuring all female leads.[129][130] However, this accolade was surpassed in 2012 by Desperate Housewives, which also lasted for eight seasons but aired two more episodes than Charmed.[7][131] In 2000, Cult TV placed Charmed at number forty-four on its list of the \"Top 100 Cult TV Shows.\"[132] In 2007, AOL TV ranked each Charmed One on its list of the \"Top TV Witches\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dPiper third, Phoebe seventh, Prue ninth and Paige twelfth.[133][134] In 2010, HuffPost TV and AOL TV ranked Charmed at number ten on their joint list of \"The Top 20 Magic/Supernatural Shows of All Time\"[135] and in 2013, TV Guide placed the series on its list of \"The 60 Greatest Sci-Fi Shows of All Time.\"[136]\nIn 2012, six years after it ceased broadcasting, Charmed was found to be the second-most binge watched television series on subscription video-on-demand services Netflix, Amazon Video and Hulu Plus.[73][74] After Charmed ended, there were never any other long-running shows about witches to rival shows about vampires and zombies.[137] In 2013, Joe Rhodes of The New York Times referred to Charmed as \"the last successful witch TV series,\"[137] while BuzzFeed writer Jarett Wieselman wrote that \"no subsequent series have been able to replicate Charmed's success.\"[7] Many witch-themed shows after Charmed have been cancelled after one or two seasons.[138][139][140] The 2013\u201314 season saw a resurgence of witches in new shows The Originals, Witches of East End, Salem, and in the third season of American Horror Story titled Coven.[141][142] In an interview with E! Online, cast member Alyssa Milano stated that she believed the success of Charmed helped pave the way for these witch-themed shows, saying \"I feel like networks are trying to replicate that.\"[141] The growing trend of witches on television that year as well as Charmed's success on Netflix prompted CBS to develop a reboot of Charmed, which later did not go past the development stage.[141][143] However, a new reboot is being developed by The CW network for the 2018\u201319 season.[144]\nWitches of East End (2013\u201314) was noted by critics for its strong resemblance to Charmed, as both shows are about a sisterhood of witches battling evil and live in similar houses, which its executive producer Maggie Friedman has acknowledged.[131][145][146][147] Other witch-themed shows that have been compared to Charmed include The Secret Circle (2011\u201312)[128][148] and Hex (2004\u201305), which has been described as \"the U.K.'s edgier, oversexed response to Charmed.\"[149] Eastwick (2009) was noted for its surface similarities to Charmed as it also focused on a trio of female witches,[150][151] which led to the show's pilot director David Nutter to say that Eastwick was not a clone of Charmed.[152] The season four episode of Smallville titled \"Spell\" also received comparisons to Charmed as it focused on three of its main female characters, who get possessed by a trio of 16th Century witches.[153][154]\nThe depiction of witchcraft in Charmed has had a significant impact on popular culture. In 2008, the religious organisation Beliefnet ranked The Charmed Ones at number eight on their list of the \"Top 10 Witches in Pop Culture.\"[155] Beliefnet praised the cultural image of Charmed for its female empowerment, mythology and how the sisters \"managed to solve their cases\" week-on-week.[155] In 2011, Seventeen magazine named The Charmed Ones ninth in its list of the top fictional witches of all time,[156] while E! Online ranked Piper at number six on their list of \"Pop Culture's Top 10 Most Bitchin' Witches.\"[157] In 2012, the Chicago Tribune placed The Charmed Ones at number seven on their list of \"The Top Pop Culture Witches of All Time.\"[158] In 2014, The Charmed Ones were ranked at number six on the \"Pop Culture's Favorite Witches\" list by MSN's Wonderwall.[159] In 2016, Piper was also ranked at number six in The Huffington Post's list of \"The Top 10 Greatest Witches of All Time.\"[160]\nCharmed has also become a pop culture reference in television shows and films. In the 2000 parody film, Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth, Barbara\u00a0Primesuspect\u00a0(Julie Benz) is said to be yelling \"Charmed my ass!\" at Shannen Doherty, who does not appear on-screen.[161] The series is also mentioned in the episode \"Ur-ine Trouble\" of teen comedy-drama series Popular, when Josh Ford (Bryce Johnson) tells Brooke McQueen (Leslie Bibb) to go home and watch Charmed.[162][163] In another episode of Popular, entitled \"The Shocking Possession of Harrison John,\" Josh asks George Austin (Anthony Montgomery) who is Michael Bernardino's (Ron Lester) \"favorite hottie witch\" on Charmed and George says it is Prue.[164] In the episode \"Faith\" of Third Watch, Fred Yokas (Chris Bauer) mentions to his wife Faith (Molly Price) that their daughter was upset she could not watch Charmed.[165] In the 2002 teen comedy film Big Fat Liar, Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) recalls watching an episode of Charmed on The WB where Alyssa\u00a0Milano's character Phoebe was about to put a spell on her demon boyfriend.[166]\nIn a 2003 episode of the Australian soap opera Neighbours, Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher) and Erin Perry (Talia Zucker) find out they have a lot in common like their love for Charmed.[167] In a 2005 episode of Neighbours, Bree Timmins (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) mentions that The O.C. is the best show on television since Charmed.[168] In the episode \"Plucky\" of sitcom So Notorious, Aaron Spelling tells his daughter Tori Spelling that \"there's always room for another witch on Charmed\" after hearing of her latest cable telemovie role.[169] In another episode of So Notorious, entitled \"Cursed,\" Tori and Sasan (Zachary Quinto) discuss who has put a curse on her and Sasan says, \"It's Shannen\u00a0[Doherty]! She knows all that witchcraft from Charmed.\"[170][171] In the season four episode \"Me and the Devil\" of True Blood, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) tells a witch named Marnie Stonebrook (Fiona Shaw) that one of her favorite television shows she watched as a child was Charmed.[172] In the episode \"Boy Parts\" of American Horror Story: Coven, a witch named Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) mentions that she grew up watching Charmed.[173] Both the show and character Piper were referenced in the episode \"Sorry for Your Loss\" of The Tomorrow People, when Piper\u00a0Nichols (Aeri\u00e9l Miranda) introduces herself to Russell Kwon (Aaron Yoo), who responds by saying \"Charmed, Piper.\"[174] Critics noted references of Charmed in the witchcraft-themed music video for British girl group Little Mix's song \"Black Magic\" (2015).[175][176][177][178]\nEver since Charmed ended in 2006, academics have appropriated its content and released essays and articles pointing out to the fact that Charmed is again more than meets the eye. It has been the subject of several collective books such as Investigating Charmed: The Magic Power of TV edited by Karin and Stan Beeler, which adopts a gender perspective to carry out an in-depth analysis of third-wave feminism as shown in the series. Between 2012 and 2015, French academic and essayist Alexis Pichard delivered a set of three lectures on Charmed. In 2012, he spoke about intertexuality and postmodernism in the series at the Universit\u00e9 de Rouen.[179] In 2014, he explored Charmed's transmedia storytelling at the Universit\u00e9 Paris 3.[180] In 2015, he investigated the show's postfeminist subversion of fairy tales at the University of Lorient, a presentation which was followed,two years later, by the publication in French academic journal TV/Series of an article entitled \"'When you said sea hag, did you mean like old woman hag or evil magic hag?'\u00a0: Imbrication du conte de f\u00e9es et du (post)f\u00e9minisme dans Charmed\" ('The embedding of fairy tales and (post)feminism in Charmed').[181] The journal's editor summarises Pichard's work as follows: \"Alexis Pichard examines gender norms as they appear on the small screen, scrutinizing the relationship between supernatural soap Charmed (The WB, 1998-2006) and the fairy tale. He describes a complex relationship where literary associations are a way of subverting traditions and expectations on the one hand \u2013 and ultimately succumbing to them on the other, with a problematic post-feminist emphasis on 'having it all'\".[182]\nThe Charmed novels are a series of books that accompany the television series. Between 1999 and 2008, forty-three novels were published by Simon & Schuster and were roughly set during the same period as the events of the television series. The first novel, The Power of Three, was released in November 1999 as a novelization of the series premiere episode, \"Something Wicca This Way Comes.\"[183] All subsequent novels \u2013 apart from Charmed Again (2001) which narrates the events of the two-part episode of the same name[184] \u2013 are original stories revolving around the Halliwell sisters and their allies. The first ten novels involve the original Charmed Ones, Prue, Piper, and Phoebe Halliwell, while the remaining thirty-three are set after both Prue's murder and the introduction of Paige Matthews as the youngest, new Charmed One. Two novels, Seasons of the Witch (2003) and The Warren Witches (2005), are anthologies of short stories.[185][186] Writers of the series include Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis who also co-authored two volumes of the official guidebook, The Book of Three (2004; 2006).\nIn 2015, HarperCollins acquired the rights to publish a second series of Charmed novels from CBS Consumer Products.[187] The first novel, The War on Witches, was published in May 2015 and its narrative is set between the events of Seasons 9 and 10 of the comic book series.[188] It is written by Ruditis, who previously authored Season 9 and edited Season 10, and follows the younger Charmed Ones' reunions with Prue and Cole Turner after their resurrections.\nThe Charmed comic books serve as a continuation of the television series and were originally published by Zenescope Entertainment.[189] The first comic book series, Charmed: Season 9, was released in June 2010 and is set eighteen months after the events of the televised show's final episode, \"Forever Charmed.\"[190] Author Paul Ruditis was the lead writer of the first series and Raven Gregory helped him co-write the first three issues.[189] The second and final comic book series by Zenescope, Charmed: Season 10, debuted at the New York Comic Con during the weekend of October 9, 2014.[191] Pat Shand was the lead writer of the second series while Ruditis assumed the role of editor.[191] In 2017, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to publish a new comic book series titled Charmed: A Thousand Deaths. It was written by Erica Schultz and illustrated by Maria Sanapo.[192]\nFour soundtrack albums of Charmed have been released and feature music that were used in the show.[193] The first soundtrack album, Charmed: The Soundtrack, was released in September 2003.[193] The second soundtrack, Charmed: The Book of Shadows, was released in January 2005[194] and the third, Charmed: The Final Chapter, was released in May\u00c2\u00a02006.[195] A retrospect of songs compiled from all eight seasons of the show, Charmed: The Final Chapter was positively received by Heather Phares of AllMusic, who praised it for \"feel[ing] like a late '90s/early 2000s time capsule\".[196] The fourth soundtrack, Charmed: Score from the Television Series, was released as a limited edition in June 2013 and featured a selection of cues from the show by composer J. Peter Robinson.[197]\nSeveral official board games of Charmed have been published by Clash of Arms and Tilsit. The show's first board game, Charmed: The Book of Shadows, was released in 2001 and the second board game, Charmed: The Source, was released in 2003.[198][199] Other board games include Charmed: The Power of Three and Charmed: The Prophecy, both of which were released in 2005.[200][201] An action, platform video game of Charmed was developed by DC Studios and published by In-Fusio.[202] The game was released for mobile phones in Europe in 2003[202] and North America in 2004.[203] Titan Magazines began publishing the Charmed Magazine in 2004, which was issued bi-monthly and featured interviews with the cast and crew, the latest news and developments, and behind-the-scenes information on the show.[204][205] The 24th and final issue of Charmed Magazine was released in 2008.[206]\nAll eight seasons of Charmed were released individually on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 between February 2005 and September 2007.[207][208] A new packaging of the Region 4 DVDs for all seasons were released in April 2011.[209] A limited Book of Shadows box set edition was released in Region 4 on November 16, 2006 and featured seasons 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7.[210] A limited Magic Chest box set edition was released in Region 2 on March 5, 2007 and included all eight seasons.[211] An ultimate box set was released in Region 2 on October 27, 2008[212] and Region 4 on November 6, 2008.[213] The set includes all seasons, with a cover that features all four Halliwell sisters together.[212] Two complete series box sets were released in Region 1 on November 18, 2008.[214] Both sets are styled after the show's Book of Shadows, with one set being a regular release and the other being a limited deluxe edition.[214][215] The complete series box set was re-released in the United States on November 11, 2014 and features a brand new cover of all four sisters.[216]\nOn October 25, 2013, it was announced that a reboot of Charmed was in development at CBS (who own all of Spelling Television's properties).[217] Party of Five co-creator Christopher Keyser and Sydney Sidner were reportedly writing the script for CBS Television Studios and The Tannenbaum Company, who were going to executive produce the reboot alongside Keyser and Sidner.[217][218] The reboot was described as a \"re-imagining of the original series centered around four sisters who discover their destiny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to battle against the forces of evil using their witchcraft.\"[219] CBS only ordered a script for a pilot, however; no commitment to filming was made.[73]\nFollowing the announcement, the original cast of Charmed shared their opinions of the reboot through Twitter. Rose McGowan tweeted, \"They really are running out of ideas in Hollywood,\" followed up by another tweet, \"lame lame lame lamertons.\"[73] Alyssa Milano tweeted, \"The thing about them doing a #charmed reboot is\u00a0...\u00a0it just\u00a0...\u00a0it feels like yesterday. It feels too close.\"[220] Holly Marie Combs tweeted, \"Here's the thing. Everything is a reboot. If you think otherwise you haven't read enough Shakespeare yet. At least they had the decency to call it what it is. Instead of ripping it off and then pretending to not be ripping it off.\"[221] Shannen Doherty tweeted to a fan, \"I don't know yet. It's strange to think about a reboot. I guess I'm still processing the idea.\"[221] However, on August 12, 2014, TVLine's Michael Ausiello revealed that CBS were not going ahead with the reboot.[222]\nOn January 5, 2017, it was announced that The CW network was working on a new reboot of Charmed by Jane the Virgin creator Jennie Snyder Urman.[144] The original pilot script was going to be set in 1976 about three witches (Tina, Paige and Annie) not related by blood, who are brought together to fight evil in a small New England town.[223][224] At the time, The CW president Mark Pedowitz stated that it would not be a prequel to the original series, and described the reboot as \"a self-contained, self-sustained\" and \"very standalone show.\"[225] However, on February 3, 2017, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the reboot would be redeveloped and delayed until the 2018\u201319 season, as the draft script \"didn't come in the way the network had hoped\" and that Urman, who was busy with Jane the Virgin, did not have enough time to fully commit to the reboot for the 2017\u201318 season.[226] Pedowitz gave an update on the reboot during the Television Critics Association summer press tour in August 2017, saying that it was still in the redevelopment process and that the network was waiting to see what Urman had come up with for the redeveloped script.[227]\nOn January 25, 2018, The CW officially ordered the Charmed reboot to pilot. The redeveloped script will now be set in the present day and has been described as \"a fierce, funny, feminist reboot\" centered on \"three sisters in a college town who, after the tragic death of their mother, are stunned to discover they are witches.\"[228][229] The reboot will revolve around the sisters \"vanquishing supernatural demons, tearing down the patriarchy and maintaining familial bonds.\"[228] The pilot will be written by Jane the Virgin writers Jessica O'Toole and Amy Rardin, and is based on a story by Urman. The trio are executive producers of the reboot alongside Ben Silverman and Brad Silberling, who will also direct the pilot.[230]\nOn February 7, 2018, TVLine revealed the reboot's casting breakdowns, with the three sisters bearing the unofficial names of Macy, Mel and Madison Pruitt.[231] Madison's name was later changed to Maggie, and the sisters' surname was changed to Vera.[232] The eldest sister Macy is a \"practical, driven, and brilliant geneticist\" with the power of telekinesis.[231][229] The second-eldest Mel is \"a passionate, outspoken activist\" and lesbian with the power of time-freezing,[233] while the youngest Maggie is \"a bubbly college freshman\" with the power to hear people's thoughts.[231][232] Madeleine Mantock has been cast as Macy,[234] Melonie Diaz has been cast as Mel,[233] and Sarah Jeffery has been cast as Maggie.[232][235] Rupert Evans will play college professor and the trio's whitelighter Harry,[236] while Ser'Darius Blain will play Macy's \"aspiring filmmaker\" boyfriend Galvin.[237] Additionally, Charlie Gillespie will play Maggie's high school boyfriend Brian, while Ellen Tamaki will play Mel's detective girlfriend Niko.[231][238] The pilot was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia from March 19 to April 6, 2018.[239][240]",

        "text": "The Smashing Pumpkins[1] are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988. Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar), the band included D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums) in its original incarnation. It has undergone many line-up changes over the course of its existence, with the current lineup being Corgan and rhythm guitarist Jeff Schroeder.\nDisavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries,[2] they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal,[3] dream pop, psychedelic rock,[3] progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\".[4]\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 20\u00c2\u00a0million albums sold in the United States alone,[5][6] The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope\u00e2\u20ac\u201dOceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. As of 2016, Corgan and Schroeder remained the band's only official core members, though Corgan began working with prior members gradually as well, including Chamberlin as a touring drummer since 2015 and Iha in some guest appearances in concerts in 2016. By mid-2016, Corgan stated that they were considering reforming the band's original lineup, though no concrete plans have been revealed.\nAfter the breakup of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins.[7][8] While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order.[9] The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar[10] with a drum machine.[11] Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub.[12][13] After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer.[14]\nJazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan's.[13] Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, \"We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.\"[9] On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.[13]\nIn 1989, the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, \"I Am One\", in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, \"Tristessa\", on Sub Pop, after which they signed to Caroline Records.[15] The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin for $20,000.[16] In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction.[17] Gish became a minor success, with the single \"Rhinoceros\" receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline.[15] The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression,[18] writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.[19]\nWith the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, \"We've graduated now from 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana', now we're 'the next Pearl Jam'.\"[20]\nAmid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer.[9] The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections.[9] The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment.[21][22] The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant.[23] Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened to the point where he contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio.[24] Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time.[9] In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.[21]\nDespite all the problems in its recording, Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart,[25] and sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone.[26] Alongside the band's mounting mainstream recognition, the band's reputation as careerists among their former peers in the independent music community was worsened.[11] Indie rock band Pavement's 1994 song \"Range Life\" directly mocks the band in its lyrics, although Stephen Malkmus, lead singer of Pavement, has stated, \"I never dissed their music. I just dissed their status.\"[27] Former H\u7aefsker D\u7aef frontman Bob Mould called them \"the grunge Monkees\",[9] and fellow Chicago musician/producer Steve Albini wrote a scathing letter in response to an article praising the band, derisively comparing them to REO Speedwagon (\"by, of and for the mainstream\") and concluding their ultimate insignificance.[28] The opening track and lead single of Siamese Dream, \"Cherub Rock\", directly addresses Corgan's feud with the \"indie-world\".[29]\nIn 1994, Virgin released the B-sides/rarities compilation Pisces Iscariot which charted higher than Siamese Dream by reaching number four on the Billboard 200.[30] Also released was a VHS cassette titled Vieuphoria featuring a mix of live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Following relentless touring to support the recordings, including headline slots on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour and at Reading Festival in 1995, the band took time off to write the follow-up album.\nDuring 1995 Corgan wrote about fifty-six songs,[31] following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \"The Wall for Generation X\",[32] and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death.[11] Praised by Time as \"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\",[33] Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995.[34] Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States[35] and became the best-selling double album of the decade to date.[36] It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\". The album spawned five singles\u2014\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\", \"1979\", \"Zero\", \"Tonight, Tonight\" which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song \"I'll Be with You Tonight\", [37] and \"Thirty-Three\"\u2014of which the first three were certified gold and all but \"Zero\" entered the Top 40. Many of the remaining songs that did not make it onto Mellon Collie were released as B-sides to the singles, and were eventually compiled in The Aeroplane Flies High box set. As a testament to the band's popularity, Virgin Records originally intended to limit the set to 200,000 copies, but produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming demand.[38]\nIn 1996, the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of Mellon Collie. Corgan's look during this period\u2014a shaved head, a longsleeve black shirt with the word \"Zero\" printed on it, and silver pants\u2014became iconic.[39] That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons, \"Homerpalooza\". With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and \"Zero\" shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time.[40][41] But the year was far from entirely positive for the band. In May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band's repeated requests for moshing to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O'Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her.[42] However, while Corgan maintained that moshing's \"time [had] come and gone\", the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.[43]\nThe band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident.[44] The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation.[9] Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he'd \"gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe.\" But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, \"For nine years we have battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We wish [him] the best we have to offer\".[45] Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of Mellon Collie stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record,[46] and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, \"The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music.\"[47]\nAfter the release of Mellon Collie, the Pumpkins contributed a number of songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song \"Eye\", which appeared on the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins' previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his \"idea [was] to reconfigure the focus and get away from the classic guitars-bass-drum rock format.\"[48] Later that year, the group contributed \"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\" to the soundtrack for the film Batman & Robin. With Matt Walker on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to \"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\" while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the 1998 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future,[49] the band's next album would feature few guitar driven songs.\nRecorded following the death of Corgan's mother and his divorce, 1998's Adore represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance. Although Adore received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States by the end of the year, which led the music industry to consider it a failure.[50] The album nonetheless sold three times as many copies overseas.[9] The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of Adore. At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of tickets sales to a local charity organization. The tour's expenses were entirely funded out of the band's own pockets. All told, the band donated over $2.8\u00c2\u00a0million to charity as a result of the tour.[51]\nIn 1999, the band surprised fans by reuniting with a rehabilitated Jimmy Chamberlin for a brief tour dubbed \"The Arising\", which showcased both new and classic material. The lineup was short-lived, however, as the band announced the departure of Wretzky in September during work on the album Machina/The Machines of God.[52] Former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited for the \"Sacred and Profane\" tour in support of the album and appeared in the videos accompanying its release. Released in 2000, Machina was initially promoted as the Pumpkins' return to a more traditional rock sound, after the more gothic, electronic-sounding Adore.[53] The album debuted at number three on the Billboard charts,[54] but quickly disappeared and as of 2007 had only been certified gold.[55][56] Music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who described the album as \"one of the strongest of their career\", noted that the stalled sales for Machina in comparison to teen pop ascendant at the time \"seems like concrete proof that a new wave of young pop fans has turned a deaf ear toward alternative rock.\"[57]\nOn May 23, 2000, in a live radio interview on KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break up at the end of that year following additional touring and recording.[53] The group's final album before the break-up, Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music, was released in September 2000 in a limited pressing on vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans. Only twenty-five copies were cut, each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs.[58] Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer Machina II as a free download to anyone who bought Machina. When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.[59]\nOn December 2, 2000, Smashing Pumpkins played a farewell concert at The Metro, the same Chicago club where their career had effectively started twelve years earlier. The four-and-a-half-hour-long show featured 35 songs spanning the group's career, and attendees were given a recording of the band's first concert at The Metro, Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88.[59] The single \"Untitled\" was released commercially to coincide with the farewell show.\nIn 2005, Billy Corgan discussed an issue that impacted the band back in 1993. In an A.P. profile that was published about the Smashing Pumpkins, guitarist James Iha and bass guitarist D'arcy Wretzky informed the writer that Billy Corgan played all of the instruments on the band's recordings. According to Corgan, this represented \"a cataclysmic moment\" in the band's history. Although this peeved other members of the band, they held together and continued onward. Billy Corgan explained that the A.P. article was one of the principal reasons that the band decided to break up.[60]\nIn 2001, the compilation Rotten Apples was released. The double-disc version of the album, released as a limited edition, included a collection of B-sides and rarities called Judas O. The Greatest Hits Video Collection DVD was also released at the same time. This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from Gish to Machina along with unreleased material.[61] Vieuphoria was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album Earphoria, previously released solely to radio stations in 1994.\nBilly Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan's next project, the short-lived supergroup Zwan. The group's only album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001, Corgan also toured as part of New Order and provided vocals on their comeback album Get Ready. In October 2004, Corgan released his first book, Blinking with Fists, a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, which he described as \"(picking) up the thread of the as-of-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins\".[62] Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, \"Walking Shade\", was released in support of the album.\nIn addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/jazz fusion project band called The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. The group released an album in 2005 titled Life Begins Again. Corgan provided guest vocals on the track \"Lokicat\". James Iha served as a guitarist in A Perfect Circle, appearing on their Thirteenth Step club tour and 2004 album, eMOTIVe. He has also been involved with other acts such as Chino Moreno's Team Sleep and Vanessa and the O's. He continues to work with his own record label as well, Scratchie Records. D'arcy Wretzky has, aside from one radio interview in 2009, not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999. On January 25, 2000, she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of crack cocaine, but after successfully completing a court-ordered drug education program, the charges were dropped.[63]\nCorgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform, although when Zwan broke up he announced, \"I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me.\"[64] Corgan said in 2005, \"I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan.\"[65] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a \"mean-spirited drug addict\" and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins.[66] On June 3, 2004, he added that \"the depth of my hurt [from Iha] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude\".[67] Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, \"No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy.\"[68]\nOn June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \"For a year now\", Corgan wrote, \"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\".[62] Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.[69][70][71]\nIn April 2007, Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion.[72][73] Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \"didn't want to be a part of\" the reunion.[74] The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton.[75] That same month, \"Tarantula\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.[76]\nThe band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week.[77] Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\".\nCorgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \"Superchrist\" and \"G.L.O.W.\" later that year.[78] That November, the group released the DVD If All Goes Wrong, which chronicled the group's 2007 concert residences in Asheville, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. In late 2008, the band commenced on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour. Around this time, Corgan said the group will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, \"The listening patterns have changed, so why are we killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track to set up the single? It's done.\"[79]\nIn March 2009, Corgan announced on the band's website that Chamberlin had left the group and would be replaced.[80] Chamberlin subsequently stated that his departure from the band is \"a positive move forward for me. I can no longer commit all of my energy into something that I don't fully possess.\"[81] Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable, commenting, \"I am glad [Corgan] has chosen to continue under the name. It is his right.\"[82] Chamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw, which has released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear.[83] In July 2009, Billy Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky, initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of The Seeds, who had recently died. The following month Corgan confirmed on the band's website that 19-year-old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair was working on new Pumpkins recordings.[84]\nThe group announced plans to release a 44-track concept album, Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, for free over the Internet one track at a time.[85] The first track, \"A Song for a Son\", was released in December 2009 to moderate press acclaim.[86][87] In March 2010, Ginger Reyes officially left the band, prompting an open call for auditions for a new bassist.[88] In May, Nicole Fiorentino announced she had joined the band as bass player, and would be working on Teargarden by Kaleidyscope.[89] The new lineup went on a world tour through to the end of 2010.[90] One of the first shows with the new lineup was a concert to benefit Matthew Leone, bassist for the rock band Madina Lake, at the Metro on July 27, 2010. In late 2010, all four members contributed to the sessions for the third volume of Teargarden.[91][92]\nOn April 26, 2011, Corgan announced that the Smashing Pumpkins would be releasing a new album titled Oceania, which he labeled as \"an album within an album\" in regards to the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project, in the fall.[93][94] As with the previous recording sessions, all four band members contributed to the project.[95] Also, the entire album catalog was to be remastered and reissued with bonus tracks, starting with Gish and Siamese Dream in November 2011.[93] The pre-Gish demos, Pisces Iscariot, and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness were released in 2012, with The Aeroplane Flies High released the following year. Adore was released in 2014, and Machina/The Machines of God and the yet commercially unreleased Machina II/Friends and Enemies of Modern Music are expected to be combined, remixed, and released in the same year. The band did a thirteen-city US tour in October 2011 followed by a European tour in November and December.[96]\nOceania was released on June 19, 2012 and received generally positive reviews. The album debuted at No.\u00a04 on the Billboard 200 and at No.\u00a01 on the Billboard Independent. The album spawned two singles, \"The Celestials\" and \"Panopticon\". The band proceeded to tour in support of the album, including a US tour involving playing the album in its entirety. By September 2012, Corgan stated that the band had already begun work on their next album.[97] However, despite this, the band concentrated on touring, playing at Glastonbury Festival, Dour Festival and the Barclays Center, where they recorded Oceania: Live in NYC, which was released on September 24, 2013, without much comment on new material.[98]\nOn March 25, 2014, Corgan announced he had signed a new record deal with BMG, for two new albums, titled Monuments to an Elegy and Day for Night, respectively.[99] In June, it was revealed that Mike Byrne was no longer in the band, to be replaced by Tommy Lee of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce on the new album, and Fiorentino would not be recording on the album either.[100][101][102] Monuments to an Elegy was released on December 5, 2014, to generally positive reviews. The band toured in support of the album starting on November 26, with Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk filling in on drums and The Killers' Mark Stoermer filling in on bass.[103] The follow-up album, which will no longer be titled Day For Night, was pushed back to a late 2015 or early 2016 release as the band continued to tour.[104]\nLater in 2015, Corgan announced that the band would undertake a co-headlining tour of North America with Marilyn Manson. The End Times Tour was set to begin in Concord, California, at the Concord Pavilion on July 7, and was scheduled to end with a concert in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the Riverbend Music Center on August 8.[105][106] Prior to the co-headlining dates, the band performed a series of acoustic shows with drum machines and tapes for percussion. When the time came for the co-headlining tour, plans for a drummer fell through and Corgan recruited Chamberlin to reunite for the shows.[107] On February 1, 2016, it was announced that the band would continue their In Plainsong acoustic tour with Jimmy Chamberlin on drums and were planning to head \"straight to the studio after the dates to record a brand new album inspired by the sounds explored in the new acoustic setting\".[108] On February 25, 2016, Corgan posted a video from a Los Angeles studio on the band's Facebook account, giving an update on the writing process for the new songs for the upcoming album to be released after the In Plainsong tour.[109] The tour began in Portland, Oregon, on March 22, 2016.[110]\nOn his birthday on March 26, 2016, original guitarist James Iha joined Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jeff Schroeder on stage unannounced at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. He performed a few songs, including \"Mayonaise\", \"Soma\" and \"Whir\" marking his first appearance with the Smashing Pumpkins in 16 years.[111] Iha also played at the second of the two Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel the following day, which was Easter Sunday. Iha joined the Pumpkins for a third time at their April 14 concert at the Civic Opera House in Chicago.[112] In August, Corgan mentioned that he had been reaching out to the original lineup, including speaking to Wretzky for the first time in sixteen years, in hopes of rekindling the relationship between members and seeing if it were potentially feasible to reform the band's original lineup of Corgan, Iha, Wretzky, and Chamberlin.[113] In June 2017, Chamberlin also mentioned the possibility of a reunion tour in 2018.[114]\nThe direction of the band is dominated by chief guitarist, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter Billy Corgan. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, \"The music [of the Smashing Pumpkins] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers.\"[9] Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, \"Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy [Chamberlin]\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho he has on board.\"[115] In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band \"as sort of an open source collective\" [116] noting that \"It's whoever feels right at the time.\".[116] Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him.[9] Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times article that Corgan's lyrics \"too often sound like sophomoric poetry\",[117] although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement.[118] Corgan responded to DeRogatis' words with \"fuck the Sun-Times\", at the band's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago.[119]\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' distinctive sound up until Adore involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process, a tactic that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness coproducer Flood called the \"Pumpkin guitar overdub army.\"[46] Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on Gish, Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with Siamese Dream; Corgan has stated that \"Soma\" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts.[120] While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\"[121] This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists & bands such as: David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra,[120] as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.[122]\nLike many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare,[9] and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions.[123] Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, \"Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin.\"[124] This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as \"arcane night music\" in prerelease promotion)[125] and the Machina albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).[9]\nThe Pumpkins drew inspiration from a variety of other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist.[46][126] When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that \"Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal\" and that they \"were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt\". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East.[46] The song \"Zero\", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed \"cybermetal.\"[127] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them.[128] Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, \"In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do.\"[129] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as \"the Pumpkin chord\" (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for \"Cherub Rock\", \"Drown\", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix.[120] Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, The Stooges, and Blue Cheer.[130]\nRegarding the band's influence upon other groups, Greg Kot wrote in 2001, \"Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini-Nirvanas, the Pumpkins remain an island unto themselves.\"[9] Still, some artists and bands have been influenced by the Pumpkins, such as Nelly Furtado,[131] Marilyn Manson,[132] Tegan and Sara,[133] Panic! at the Disco,[134] and members of My Chemical Romance. My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way has said that they pattern their career upon the Pumpkins',[135] including music videos.[136] The members of fellow Chicago band Kill Hannah are friends with Corgan,[137] and lead singer Mat Devine has compared his group to the Pumpkins.[138]\nThe Smashing Pumpkins have been praised as \"responsible for some of the most striking and memorable video clips\" and for having \"approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums\".[140] MTV's 2001 anniversary special Testimony: 20\u00c2\u00a0Years of Rock on MTV credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, \"We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff.\"[141] The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake (\"Cherub Rock\"), Samuel Bayer (\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (\"Rocket\", \"1979\", \"Tonight, Tonight\", \"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\", and \"Perfect\"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, \"I know my [initial] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler.\"[142] Videos like \"Today\", \"Rocket\", and \"1979\" dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for \"Thirty-Three\", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.[143]\nThe band was nominated for several MTV Video Music Awards during the 1990s. In 1996, the group won seven VMAs total for the \"1979\" and \"Tonight, Tonight\" videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for \"Tonight, Tonight\". The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony. Of the \"Tonight, Tonight\" video, Corgan remarked, \"I don't think we've ever had people react [like this]... it just seemed to touch a nerve.\"[144]\nShortly after the band's 2000 breakup, the Greatest Hits Video Collection was released, collecting the band's music videos from 1991 to 2000 and including commentary from Corgan, Iha, Chamberlin, Wretzky, and various music video directors with outtakes, live performances, and the extended \"Try, Try, Try\" short film.[145] The band has also released several music videos to YouTube and other online sources since reuniting.",

Kennedy in West Berlin. It is widely regarded as the best-known speech of the Cold War and the most famous anti-communist speech. Kennedy aimed to underline the support of the United States for West Germany 22 months after Soviet-supported East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to prevent mass emigration to the West. The message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. Another phrase in the speech was also spoken in German, \"Lasst sie nach Berlin kommen\" (\"Let them come to Berlin\"), addressed at those who claimed \"we can work with the Communists\", a remark at which Nikita Khrushchev scoffed only days later.\nThe speech is considered one of Kennedy's best, both a notable moment of the Cold War and a high point of the New Frontier. It was a great morale boost for West Berliners, who lived in an enclave deep inside East Germany and feared a possible East German occupation. Speaking from a platform erected on the steps of Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg for an audience of 450,000, Kennedy said,\nTwo thousand years ago, the proudest boast was civis romanus sum [\"I am a Roman citizen\"]. Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"... All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\"\nKennedy used the phrase twice in his speech, including at the end, pronouncing the sentence with his Boston accent and reading from his note \"ish bin ein Bearleener\", which he had written out using English orthography to approximate the German pronunciation. He also used classical Latin pronunciation of civis romanus sum, with the c pronounced /k/ and the v as /w/.\nThere is a widespread misconception (outside German-speaking countries) that the phrase is incorrect German and in fact means \"I'm a doughnut\". It has even been embellished into an urban legend including equally incorrect claims about the audience laughing at this phrase.\nGermany's capital, Berlin, was deep within the area controlled after World War II by the Soviet Union. Initially governed in four sectors controlled by the four Allied powers (United States, United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union), tensions of the Cold War escalated until the Soviet forces implemented the Berlin Blockade, which the Western allies relieved with the dramatic airlift. Afterward, the sectors controlled by the NATO Allies became an effective exclave of West Germany, completely surrounded by East Germany. From 1952, the border between East and West was closed everywhere but in Berlin. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans defected to the West via West Berlin, a labour drain that threatened East Germany with economic collapse.\nIn 1961, the East German government under Walter Ulbricht erected a barbed-wire barrier around West Berlin, officially called the antifaschistischer Schutzwall (anti-fascist protective barrier). The East German authorities argued that it was meant to prevent spies and agents of West Germany from crossing into the East. However, it was universally known as the Berlin Wall and its real purpose was to keep East German citizens from escaping to the West. Over a period of months the wall was rebuilt using concrete, and buildings were demolished to create a \"death zone\" in view of East German guards armed with machine guns. The Wall closed the biggest loophole in the Iron Curtain, and Berlin went from being one of the easiest places to cross from East Europe to West Europe to being one of the most difficult.[1]\nThe West, including the U.S., was accused of failing to respond forcefully to the erection of the Wall. Officially, Berlin was under joint occupation by the four allied powers, each with primary responsibility for a certain zone. Kennedy's speech marked the first instance where the U.S. acknowledged that East Berlin was part of the Soviet bloc along with the rest of East Germany. On July 25, 1961, Kennedy insisted in a presidential address that the U.S. would defend West Berlin, asserting its Four-Power rights, while making it clear that challenging the Soviet presence in Germany was not possible.\nThe Ich bin ein Berliner speech is in part derived from a speech Kennedy gave at a Civic Reception on May 4, 1962, in New Orleans; there also he used the phrase civis Romanus sum by saying \"Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was to say, \"I am a citizen of Rome.\" Today, I believe, in 1962 the proudest boast is to say, \"I am a citizen of the United States.\" And it is not enough to merely say it; we must live it. Anyone can say it. But Americans who serve today in West Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyour sons and brothers --[...] are the Americans who are bearing the great burden.\"[2] The phrases \"I am a Berliner\" and \"I am proud to be in Berlin\" were typed already a week before the speech on a list of expressions to be used, including a phonetic transcription of the German translation. Such transcriptions are also found in the third draft of the speech (in Kennedy's own handwriting), from June 25. The final typed version of the speech does not contain the transcriptions, which are added by hand by Kennedy himself.[3]\nIn practice sessions before the trip, Kennedy had run through a number of sentences, even paragraphs, to recite in German; in these sessions, he was helped by Margaret Plischke, a translator working for the US State Department; by Ted Sorensen, Kennedy's counsel and habitual speechwriter; and by an interpreter, Robert Lochner, who had grown up in Berlin. It became clear quickly that the president did not have a gift for languages and was more likely to embarrass himself if he was to cite in German for any length.[3]\nBut there are differing accounts on the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner. Plischke wrote a 1997 account[4] of visiting Kennedy at the White House weeks before the trip to help compose the speech and teach him the proper pronunciation; she also claims that the phrase had been translated stateside already by the translator scheduled to accompany him on the trip (\"a rather unpleasant man who complained bitterly that he had had to interrupt his vacation just to watch the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mannerisms\").[5] Additionally, Ted Sorensen claimed in his memoir Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History (2008) to have had a hand in the speech, and said he had incorrectly inserted the word ein, incorrectly taking responsibility for the \"jelly doughnut misconception\", below,[6] a claim apparently supported by Berlin mayor Willy Brandt but dismissed by later scholars since the final typed version, which does not contain the words, is the last one Sorensen could have worked on.[3] Robert Lochner claimed in his memoirs that Kennedy had asked him for a translation of \"I am a Berliner\", and that they practiced the phrase in Brandt's office.[3] Daum credited the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner to Kennedy and his 1962 speech in New Orleans quoted above. According to Daum, Kennedy was affected by seeing the Berlin Wall, so that he \"falls back on the most memorable passage of his New Orleans speech given the year before, changing pride in being an American in being a Berliner.\"[3]\nBehind the long table set up on the steps of the Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg were U.S. and German dignitaries, including Dean Rusk (Kennedy's Secretary of State), Lucius D. Clay (the US administrator of Germany), Konrad Adenauer (the German chancellor), Willy Brandt, and Otto Bach (President of the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin). The crowd was estimated at 450,000 people.[7] Bach spoke first, of the recent developments in Berlin, especially the wall. He was followed by Konrad Adenauer, who spoke briefly and introduced the president.\nKennedy was accompanied not by Robert Lochner, but by Heinz Weber of the Berlin mission; Weber translated the president's speech to the audience. Besides the typescript, Kennedy had a cue card on which he himself had written the phonetic spelling, and he surprised everyone by completely disregarding the speech, which had taken weeks to prepare. Instead, he improvised: \"He says more than he should, something different from what his advisers had recommended, and is more provocative than he had intended to be.\"[3]\nThe speech culminated with the second use in the speech of the Ich bin ein Berliner phrase: \"Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner!\" The crowd was quiet while Weber translated and repeated the president's German line; Kennedy was obviously relieved at the crowd's positive response and thanked Weber for his translation. Weber translated this compliment also. According to Daum, after this first successful delivery, \"Kennedy, who fiddles a bit with his suit jacket, is grinning like a boy who has just pulled off a coup.\"[3]\nKennedy's National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy thought the speech had gone \"a little too far\", and the two revised the text for a softer stance before repeating the speech at the Freie Universit\u00c3\u00a4t Berlin later that day.[8]\nWhile the immediate response from the West German population was positive, the Soviet authorities were less pleased with the combative Lass sie nach Berlin kommen. Only two weeks before, Kennedy had spoken in a more conciliatory tone, speaking of \"improving relations with the Soviet Union\": in response to Kennedy's Berlin speech, Nikita Khrushchev, days later, remarked that \"one would think that the speeches were made by two different Presidents.\"[9]\nRonald Reagan would evoke both the sentiment and the legacy of Kennedy's speech 24 years later in his \"Tear down this wall!\" speech.\nThere are commemorative sites to Kennedy in Berlin, such as the German-American John F. Kennedy School and the John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies of the FU Berlin. The public square in front of the Rathaus Sch\u00c3\u00b6neberg was renamed John-F.-Kennedy-Platz. A large plaque dedicated to Kennedy is mounted on a column at the entrance of the building and the room above the entrance and overlooking the square is dedicated to Kennedy and his visit.\nThe original manuscript of the speech is stored with the National Archives and Records Administration.\nThere is a widespread perception that Kennedy made an embarrassing mistake by saying Ich bin ein Berliner. By not leaving out the indefinite article \"ein,\" he supposedly changed the meaning of the sentence from the intended \"I am a citizen of Berlin\" to \"I am a Berliner\" (a Berliner being a type of German pastry, similar to a jelly doughnut).\nAccording to some grammar texts,[10] the indefinite article can be omitted in German when speaking of an individual's profession or origin but is in any case used when speaking in a figurative sense.[11][12]\nFurthermore, although the word \"Berliner\"[9][13] is used for a jelly doughnut in the north, west and southwest of Germany, it is not used in Berlin itself or the surrounding region, where the usual word is \"Pfannkuchen.\"\nA further part of the misconception is that the audience to his speech laughed at his supposed error. They actually cheered and applauded both times the phrase was used. They laughed and cheered a few seconds after the first use of the phrase when Kennedy joked with the interpreter: \"I appreciate my interpreter translating my German.\"[14]\nA reference to this misconception appears in Len Deighton's spy novel Berlin Game, published in 1983, which contains the following passage, spoken by Bernard Samson:\n'Ich bin ein Berliner,' I said. It was a joke. A Berliner is a doughnut. The day after President Kennedy made his famous proclamation, Berlin cartoonists had a field day with talking doughnuts.[15]\nIn Deighton's novel, Samson is an unreliable narrator, and his words cannot be taken at face value. However, The New York Times' review of Deighton's novel appeared to treat Samson's remark as factual and added the detail that Kennedy's audience found his remark funny:\nHere is where President Kennedy announced, Ich bin ein Berliner, and thereby amused the city's populace because in the local parlance a Berliner is a doughnut.[16]\nFour years later, it found its way into a New York Times op-ed:\nIt's worth recalling, again, President John F. Kennedy's use of a German phrase while standing before the Berlin Wall. It would be great, his wordsmiths thought, for him to declare himself a symbolic citizen of Berlin. Hence, Ich bin ein Berliner. What they did not know, but could easily have found out, was that such citizens never refer to themselves as 'Berliners.' They reserve that term for a favorite confection often munched at breakfast. So, while they understood and appreciated the sentiments behind the President's impassioned declaration, the residents tittered among themselves when he exclaimed, literally, \"I am a jelly-filled doughnut.\"[17]\nThe doughnut misconception has since been repeated by media such as the BBC (by Alistair Cooke in his Letter from America program),[18] The Guardian,[19] MSNBC,[20] CNN,[21] Time magazine,[22] and The New York Times;[6] mentioned in several books about Germany written by English-speaking authors, including Norman Davies[23] and Kenneth C. Davis;[24] and used in the manual for the Speech Synthesis Markup Language.[25] It is also mentioned in Robert Dallek's biography of Kennedy, An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917\u20131963.[26]\nAnother reference to this misconception appears in David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest, published in 1996, which contains the following passage:\nFew foreigners realize that the German term Berliner is also the vulgate idiom for a common jelly doughnut, and thus that Kennedy's seminal 'Ich bin ein Berliner' was greeted by the Teutonic crowds with a delight only apparently political.[27]\nThe phrase and the legend are quoted very often in fiction and popular culture in the United States. Besides a direct quote, there exist many variations starting \"Ich bin ein (+ noun, e.g., Frankfurter, Hamburger)\" that is supposed to be understood by the primarily English-speaking audience based on the widespread knowledge of this German phrase and its myth. The phrase is perhaps ambiguous, but in context it is clear.",

        "text": "The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about 106,460,000 square kilometers (41,100,000 square miles).[2][3] It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \"Old World\" from the \"New World\".\nThe Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected global ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica). The Equatorial Counter Current subdivides it into the North Atlantic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean at about 8\u00c2\u00b0N.[5]\nScientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.[5]\nThe oldest known mentions of an \"Atlantic\" sea come from Stesichorus around mid-sixth century BC (Sch. A. R. 1. 211):[6] Atlantikoi pel\u00e1gei (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9; English: 'the Atlantic sea'; etym. 'Sea of Atlantis') and in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): Atlantis thalassa (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1; English: 'Sea of Atlantis' or 'the Atlantis sea'[7]) where the name refers to \"the sea beyond the pillars of Heracles\" which is said to be part of the ocean that surrounds all land.[8] Thus, on one hand, the name refers to Atlas, the Titan in Greek mythology, who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in Medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases.[9] On the other hand, to early Greek sailors and in Ancient Greek mythological literature such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, this all-encompassing ocean was instead known as Oceanus, the gigantic river that encircled the world; in contrast to the enclosed seas well-known to the Greeks: the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.[10] In contrast, the term \"Atlantic\" originally referred specifically to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the sea off the Strait of Gibraltar and the North African coast.[9] The Greek word thalassa has been reused by scientists for the huge Panthalassa ocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea hundreds of million years ago.\nThe term \"Aethiopian Ocean\", derived from Ancient Ethiopia, was applied to the Southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.[11]\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953,[12] but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities, institutions, and countries, see for example the CIA World Factbook. Correspondingly, the extent and number of oceans and seas varies.\nThe Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are Europe: the Strait of Gibraltar (where it connects with the Mediterranean Sea\u2013one of its marginal seas\u2013and, in turn, the Black Sea, both of which also touch upon Asia) and Africa.\nIn the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20\u00b0 East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica defines its border. In the 1953 definition it extends south to Antarctica, while in later maps it is bounded at the 60\u00b0 parallel by the Southern Ocean.[12]\nThe Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Labrador Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies.[1] Including these marginal seas the coast line of the Atlantic measures 111,866\u00a0km (69,510\u00a0mi) compared to 135,663\u00a0km (84,297\u00a0mi) for the Pacific.[1][13]\nIncluding its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers an area of 106,460,000\u00a0km2 (41,100,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) or 23.5% of the global ocean and has a volume of 310,410,900\u00a0km3 (74,471,500\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) or 23.3%. Excluding its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers 81,760,000\u00a0km2 (31,570,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has a volume of 305,811,900\u00a0km3 (73,368,200\u00a0cu\u00a0mi). The North Atlantic covers 41,490,000\u00a0km2 (16,020,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (11.5%) and the South Atlantic 40,270,000\u00a0km2 (15,550,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (11.1%).[4] The average depth is 3,646\u00a0m (11,962\u00a0ft) and the maximum depth, the Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico Trench, is 8,486\u00a0m (27,841\u00a0ft).[4][14]\nThe bathymetry of the Atlantic is dominated by a submarine mountain range called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). It runs from 87\u00b0N or 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) south of the North Pole to the subantarctic Bouvet Island at 42\u00b0S.[15]\nThe MAR divides the Atlantic longitudinally into two halves, in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary, transverse ridges. The MAR reaches above 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) along most of its length, but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places: the Romanche Trench near the Equator and the Gibbs Fracture Zone at 53\u00b0N. The MAR is a barrier for bottom water, but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other.[16]\nThe MAR rises 2\u20133\u00a0km (1.2\u20131.9\u00a0mi) above the surrounding ocean floor and its rift valley is the divergent boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates in the North Atlantic and the South American and African plates in the South Atlantic. The MAR produces basaltic volcanoes in Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, Iceland, and pillow lava on the ocean floor.[17] The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than 2,700\u00a0m (1,500 fathoms; 8,900\u00a0ft) in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep.[18]\nThe MAR is intersected by two perpendicular ridges: the Azores\u2013Gibraltar Transform Fault, the boundary between the Nubian and Eurasian plates, intersects the MAR at the Azores Triple Junction, on either side of the Azores microplate, near the 40\u00b0N.[19] A much vaguer, nameless boundary, between the North American and South American plates, intersects the MAR near or just north of the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone, approximately at 16\u00b0N.[20]\nIn the 1870s, the Challenger expedition discovered parts of what is now known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, or:\nAn elevated ridge rising to an average height of about 1,900 fathoms\u00a0[3,500\u00a0m; 11,400\u00a0ft] below the surface traverses the basins of the North and South Atlantic in a meridianal direction from Cape Farewell, probably its far south at least as Gough Island, following roughly the outlines of the coasts of the Old and the New Worlds.[21]\nThe remainder of the ridge was discovered in the 1920s by the German Meteor expedition using echo-sounding equipment.[22] The exploration of the MAR in the 1950s led to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics.[15]\nMost of the MAR runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands. While nine of these have collectively been nominated a World Heritage Site for their geological value, four of them are considered of \"Outstanding Universal Value\" based on their cultural and natural criteria: \u00deingvellir, Iceland; Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture, Portugal; Gough and Inaccessible Islands, United Kingdom; and Brazilian Atlantic Islands: Fernando de Noronha and Atol das Rocas Reserves, Brazil.[15]\nContinental shelves in the Atlantic are wide off Newfoundland, southern-most South America, and north-eastern Europe. In the western Atlantic carbonate platforms dominate large areas, for example the Blake Plateau and Bermuda Rise. The Atlantic is surrounded by passive margins except at a few locations where active margins form deep trenches: the Puerto Rico Trench (8,414\u00a0m or 27,605\u00a0ft maximum depth) in the western Pacific and South Sandwich Trench (8,264\u00a0m or 27,113\u00a0ft) in the South Atlantic. There are numerous submarine canyons off north-eastern North America, western Europe, and north-western Africa. Some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep-sea channels.[16]\nIn 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred. The USS Stewart used a Navy Sonic Depth Finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the Atlantic. This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel.[23] The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, abyssal plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and some guyots. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.\nThe mean depth between 60\u00b0N and 60\u00b0S is 3,730\u00a0m (12,240\u00a0ft), or close to the average for the global ocean, with a modal depth between 4,000 and 5,000\u00a0m (13,000 and 16,000\u00a0ft).[16]\nIn the South Atlantic the Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise form barriers to ocean currents. The Laurentian Abyss is found off the eastern coast of Canada.\nSurface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F) to over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C (13\u201314\u00a0\u00b0F).[5]\nFrom October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and Baltic Sea.[5]\nThe Coriolis effect circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above 40\u00c2\u00b0 North some east-west oscillation, known as the North Atlantic oscillation, occurs.[5]\nOn average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 \u2013 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25\u00b0 north and south, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.[5]\nThe high surface salinity in the Atlantic, on which the Atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent, is maintained by two processes: the Agulhas Leakage/Rings, which brings salty Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic, and the \"Atmospheric Bridge\", which evaporates subtropical Atlantic waters and exports it to the Pacific.[24]\nThe Atlantic Ocean consists of four major, upper water masses with distinct temperature and salinity. The Atlantic Subarctic Upper Water in the northern-most North Atlantic is the source for Subarctic Intermediate Water and North Atlantic Intermediate Water. North Atlantic Central Water can be divided into the Eastern and Western North Atlantic central Water since the western part is strongly affected by the Gulf Stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water. The eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to Mediterranean Water. North Atlantic Central Water flows into South Atlantic Central Water at 15\u00c2\u00b0N.[26]\nThere are five intermediate waters: four low-salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high-salinity formed through evaporation. Arctic Intermediate Water, flows from north to become the source for North Atlantic Deep Water south of the Greenland-Scotland sill. These two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins. The wide range of salinities in the North Atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources: Labrador Sea, Norwegian-Greenland Sea, Mediterranean, and South Atlantic Intermediate Water.[26]\nThe North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a complex of four water masses, two that form by deep convection in the open ocean\u00a0\u2014 Classical and Upper Labrador Sea Water\u00a0\u2014 and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland sill\u00a0\u2014 Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water. Along its path across Earth the composition of the NADW is affected by other water masses, especially Antarctic Bottom Water and Mediterranean Overflow Water.[27] The NADW is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern North Atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in Europe. Changes in the formation of NADW have been linked to global climate changes in the past. Since man-made substances were introduced into the environment, the path of the NADW can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from nuclear weapon tests in the 1960s and CFCs.[28]\nThe clockwise warm-water North Atlantic Gyre occupies the northern Atlantic, and the counter-clockwise warm-water South Atlantic Gyre appears in the southern Atlantic.[5]\nIn the North Atlantic surface circulation is dominated by three inter-connected currents: the Gulf Stream which flows north-east from the North American coast at Cape Hatteras; the North Atlantic Current, a branch of the Gulf Stream which flows northward from the Grand Banks; and the Subpolar Front, an extension of the North Atlantic Current, a wide, vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre. This system of currents transport warm water into the North Atlantic, without which temperatures in the North Atlantic and Europe would plunge dramatically.[29]\nNorth of the North Atlantic Gyre, the cyclonic North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre plays a key role in climate variability. It is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography, rather than being steered by wind, both in the deep ocean and at sea level.[30] The subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation. Its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the North Atlantic Current which transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic. There this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of Greenland where they form an intense (40\u201350\u00a0Sv) current which flows around the continental margins of the Labrador Sea. A third of this water become parts of the deep portion of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The NADW, in its turn, feed the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change. Large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decade-century scale, associated with the North Atlantic oscillation, are especially pronounced in Labrador Sea Water, the upper layers of the MOC.[31]\nThe South Atlantic is dominated by the anti-cyclonic southern subtropical gyre. The South Atlantic Central Water originates in this gyre, while Antarctic Intermediate Water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region, near the Drake Passage and Falkland Islands. Both these currents receive some contribution from the Indian Ocean. On the African east coast the small cyclonic Angola Gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre.[32] The southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a wind-induced Ekman layer. The residence time of the gyre is 4.4\u20138.5\u00a0years. North Atlantic Deep Water flows southerward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre.[33]\nThe Sargasso Sea in the western North Atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of Sargassum (S. fluitans and natans) float, an area 4,000\u00a0km (2,500\u00a0mi) wide and encircled by the Gulf Stream, North Atlantic Drift, and North Equatorial Current. This population of seaweed probably originated from Tertiary ancestors on the European shores of the former Tethys Ocean and has, if so, maintained itself by vegetative growth, floating in the ocean for millions of years.[34]\nOther species endemic to the Sargasso Sea include the sargassum fish, a predator with algae-like appendages who hovers motionless among the Sargassum. Fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former Tethys Ocean, in what is now the Carpathian region, that were similar to the Sargasso Sea. It is possible that the population in the Sargasso Sea migrated to the Atlantic as the Tethys closed at the end of the Miocene around 17\u00a0Ma.[34] The origin of the Sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries. The fossils found in the Carpathians in the mid-20th century, often called the \"quasi-Sargasso assemblage\", finally showed that this assemblage originated in the Carpathian Basin from were it migrated over Sicily to the Central Atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the Sargasso Sea.[35]\nThe location of the spawning ground for European eels remained unknown for decades. In the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern Sargasso Sea is the spawning ground for both the European and American eel and that the former migrate more than 5,000\u00a0km (3,100\u00a0mi) and the latter 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi). Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream transport eel larvae from the Sargasso Sea to foraging areas in North America, Europe, and Northern Africa.[36] Recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use Earth's magnetic field to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults.[37]\nClimate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.[5]\nThe oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.[5]\nThe Gulf Stream and its northern extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate. For example, the Gulf Stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern North America, keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas. The Gulf Stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the Florida Peninsula. In the higher latitudes, the North Atlantic Drift, warms the atmosphere over the oceans, keeping the British Isles and north-western Europe mild and cloudy, and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the Grand Banks of Newfoundland area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas.[5]\nIcebergs are common from February to August in the Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda and Madeira. Ships are subject to superstructure icing in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).\nThe United States' southeast coast, especially the Virginia and North Carolina coasts, has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs.\nThe Bermuda Triangle is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but Coast Guard records do not support this belief.\nHurricanes are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely tropical cyclones form in the southern parts. Hurricanes usually form annually between June and November.\nThe break-up of Pangaea began in the Central Atlantic, between North America and Northwest Africa, where rift basins opened during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. This period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the Atlas Mountains. The exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170\u00c2\u00a0Ma.[38]\nThe opening of the Atlantic Ocean coincided with the initial break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea, both of which were initiated by the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in Earth's history associated with the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event, one of Earth's major extinction events.[39] Theoliitic dikes, sills, and lava flows from the CAMP eruption at 200\u00a0Ma have been found in West Africa, eastern North America, and northern South America. The extent of the volcanism has been estimated to 4.5\u00d7106\u00a0km2 (1.7\u00d7106\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of which 2.5\u00d7106\u00a0km2 (9.7\u00d7105\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) covered what is now northern and central Brazil.[40]\nThe formation of the Central American Isthmus closed the Central American Seaway at the end of the Pliocene 2.8\u00c2\u00a0Ma ago. The formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many land-living animals, known as the Great American Interchange, but the closure of the seaway resulted in a \"Great American Schism\" as it affected ocean currents, salinity, and temperatures in both the Atlantic and Pacific. Marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct.[41]\nGeologically the Northern Atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins, Newfoundland and Iberia, and to the north by the Arctic Eurasian Basin. The opening of the Northern Atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor, the Iapetus Ocean, and spread from the Central Atlantic in six stages: Iberia\u2013Newfoundland, Porcupine\u2013North America, Eurasia\u2013Greenland, Eurasia\u2013North America. Active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the Iceland hotspot.[42]\nWest Gondwana (South America and Africa) broke up in the Early Cretaceous to form the South Atlantic. The apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the South Atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computer-assisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965.[43][44] This magnificent fit, however, has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward-propagating break-up.[43] Intra-continental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into sub-plates.[45]\nGeologically the South Atlantic can be divided into four segments: Equatorial segment, from 10\u00c2\u00b0N to the Romanche Fracture Zone (RFZ);; Central segment, from RFZ to Florianopolis Fracture Zone (FFZ, north of Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise); Southern segment, from FFZ to the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone (AFFZ); and Falkland segment, south of AFFZ.[46]\nIn the southern segment the Early Cretaceous (133\u2013130\u00a0Ma) intensive magmatism of the Paran\u00e1\u2013Etendeka Large Igneous Province produced by the Tristan hotspot resulted in an estimated volume of 1.5\u00d7106 to 2.0\u00d7106\u00a0km3 (3.6\u00d7105 to 4.8\u00d7105\u00a0cu\u00a0mi). It covered an area of 1.2\u00d7106 to 1.6\u00d7106\u00a0km2 (4.6\u00d7105 to 6.2\u00d7105\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay and 0.8\u00d7105\u00a0km2 (3.1\u00d7104\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Africa. Dyke swarms in Brazil, Angola, eastern Paraguay, and Namibia, however, suggest the LIP originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas. Associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the Falkland Islands and South Africa. Traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 147\u201349\u00a0Ma with two peaks between 143\u2013121\u00a0Ma and 90\u201360\u00a0Ma.[46]\nIn the Falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the Patagonia and Colorado sub-plates between the Early Jurassic (190\u00a0Ma) and the Early Cretaceous (126.7\u00a0Ma). Around 150\u00a0Ma sea-floor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment. No later than 130\u00a0Ma rifting had reached the Walvis Ridge\u2013Rio Grande Rise.[45]\nIn the central segment rifting started to break Africa in two by opening the Benue Trough around 118\u00a0Ma. Rifting in the central segment, however, coincided with the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (also known as the Cretaceous quiet period), a 40\u00a0Ma period without magnetic reversals, which makes it difficult to date sea-floor spreading in this segment.[45]\nThe equatorial segment is the last phase of the break-up, but, because it is located on the Equator, magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating. Various estimates date the propagation of sea-floor spreading in this segment to the period 120\u201396\u00a0Ma. This final stage, nevertheless, coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in Africa.[45]\nAbout 50\u00a0Ma the opening of the Drake Passage resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the South American and Antarctic plates. First small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the Middle Eocene. 34\u201330\u00a0Ma a deeper seaway developed, followed by an Eocene\u2013Oligocene climatic deterioration and the growth of the Antarctic ice sheet.[47]\nAn embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of Gibraltar. The Gibraltar Arc in the western Mediterranean is migrating westward into the Central Atlantic where it joins the converging African and Eurasian plates. Together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern Atlantic Basin. Meanwhile, the Scotia Arc and Caribbean Plate in the western Atlantic Basin are eastward-propagating subduction systems that might, together with the Gibraltar system, represent the beginning of the closure of the Atlantic Ocean and the final stage of the Atlantic Wilson Cycle.[48]\nHumans evolved in Africa; first by diverging from other apes around 7\u00a0Ma; then developing stone tools around 2.6\u00a0Ma; to finally evolve as modern humans around 100\u00a0kya. The earliest evidences for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) along the coast of South Africa. During the latest glacial stages the now-submerged plains of the Agulhas Bank were exposed above sea level, extending the South African coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers. A small population of modern humans\u00a0\u2014 probably fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals\u00a0\u2014 survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these Palaeo-Agulhas plains. The GCFR is delimited to the north by the Cape Fold Belt and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex Stone Age technologies emerged.[49] Human history thus begins on the coasts of South Africa where the Atlantic Benguela Upwelling and Indian Ocean Agulhas Current meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish, fur seal, fishes and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources.[50] The African origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70,000 years-old engravings from Blombos Cave, South Africa.[51]\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies indicate that 80\u201360,000 years ago a major demographic expansion within Africa, derived from a single, small population, coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid MIS\u00a05\u20134 environmental changes. This group of people not only expanded over the whole of Africa, but also started to disperse out of Africa into Asia, Europe, and Australasia around 65,000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions.[52] During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 20,000 years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the European North Atlantic coast and retreat to the Mediterranean. Following rapid climate changes at the end of the LGM this region was repopulated by Magdalenian culture. Other hunter-gatherers followed in waves interrupted by large-scale hazards such as the Laacher See volcanic eruption, the inundation of Doggerland (now the North Sea), and the formation of the Baltic Sea.[53] The European coasts of the North Atlantic were permanently populated about 9\u20138.5 thousand years ago.[54]\nThis human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean. 50\u00a0ka-old, deeply stratified shell middens found in Ysterfontein on the western coast of South Africa are associated with the Middle Stone Age (MSA). The MSA population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations. While their middens resemble 12\u201311\u00a0ka-old Late Stone Age (LSA) middens found on every inhabited continent, the 50\u201345\u00a0ka-old Enkapune Ya Muto in Kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of Africa.[55]\nThe same development can be seen in Europe. In La Riera Cave (23\u201313\u00a0ka) in Asturias, Spain, only some 26,600 molluscs were deposited over 10\u00a0ka. In contrast, 8\u20137\u00a0ka-old shell middens in Portugal, Denmark, and Brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts. The Erteb\u00f8lle middens in Denmark, for example, accumulated 2,000\u00a0m3 (71,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of shell deposits representing some 50 million molluscs over only a thousand years. This intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologies\u00a0\u2014 such as boats, harpoons, and fish-hooks\u00a0\u2014 because many caves found in the Mediterranean and on the European Atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower. The earliest exploitation, however, took place on the now submerged shelves, and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves. The reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland.[56]\nDuring the LGM the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of northern North America while Beringia connected Siberia to Alaska. In 1973 late U.S. geoscientist Paul S. Martin proposed a \"blitzkrieg\" colonization of America by which Clovis hunters migrated into North America around 13,000 years ago in a single wave through an ice-free corridor in the ice sheet and \"spread southward explosively, briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey.\"[57] Others later proposed a \"three-wave\" migration over the Bering Land Bridge.[58] These hypotheses remained the long-held view regarding the settlement of the Americas, a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries: the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas have been found in South America; sites in north-east Siberia report virtually no human presence there during the LGM; and most Clovis artefacts have been found in eastern North America along the Atlantic coast.[59] Furthermore, colonisation models based on mtDNA, yDNA, and atDNA data respectively support neither the \"blitzkrieg\" nor the \"three-wave\" hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results. Contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will, eventually, confirm each other.[60] A proposed route across the Pacific to South America could explain early South American finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path, through the Canadian Arctic and down the North American Atlantic coast.[61] Early settlements across the Atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories, ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed, including the Solutrean hypothesis and some of the Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories.\nThe Norse settlement of the Faroe Islands and Iceland began during the 9th and 10th centuries. A settlement on Greenland was established before 1000\u00a0CE, but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early Little Ice Age. This setback was caused by a range of factors: an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation, while conflicts with the local Inuit resulted in the failure to adapt their Arctic technologies; a colder climate resulted in starvation; and the colony got economically marginalized as the Great Plague and Barbary pirates harvested its victims on Iceland in the 15th century.[62] Iceland was initially settled 865\u2013930\u00a0CE following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around 2\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F) which made farming favorable at high latitudes. This did not last, however, and temperatures quickly dropped; at 1080\u00a0CE summer temperatures had reached a maximum of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). The Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k (Book of Settlement) records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement\u00a0\u2014 \"men ate foxes and ravens\" and \"the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs\"\u00a0\u2014 and by the early 1200s hay had to be abandoned for short-season crops such as barley.[63]\nChristopher Columbus discovered the Americas in 1492 under Spanish flag.[64] Six years later Vasco da Gama reached India under Portuguese flag, by navigating south around the Cape of Good Hope, thus proving that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are connected. In 1500, in his voyage to India following Vasco da Gama, Pedro Alvares Cabral reached Brazil, taken by the currents of the South Atlantic Gyre. Following these explorations, Spain and Portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the New World and forced the Native American population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found. Spain and Portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other European nations out, but conflicting interests nevertheless led to a series of Spanish-Portuguese wars. A peace treaty mediated by the Pope divided the conquered territories into Spanish and Portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away. England, France, and the Dutch Republic enviously watched the Spanish and Portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as Henry Mainwaring and Alexandre Exquemelin. They could explore the convoys leaving America because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable.[64]\nIn the American colonies depredation, disease, and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous American population to the extent that the Atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace them\u00a0\u2014 a trade that became norm and an integral part of the colonization. Between the 15th century and 1888, when Brazil became the last part of America to end slave trade, an estimated ten million Africans were exported as slaves, most of them destined for agricultural labour. The slave trade was officially abolished in the British Empire and the United States in 1808, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire in 1838 and in the U.S. in 1865 after the Civil War.[65][66]\nFrom Columbus to the Industrial Revolution Trans-Atlantic trade, including colonialism and slavery, became crucial for Western Europe. For European countries with a direct access to the Atlantic (including Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) 1500\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in Eastern Europe and Asia. Colonialism evolved as part of the Trans-Atlantic trade, but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs. Growth was more rapid in non-absolutist countries, such as Britain and the Netherlands, and more limited in absolutist monarchies, such as Portugal, Spain, and France, where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies.[67]\nTrans-Atlantic trade also resulted in an increasing urbanization: in European countries facing the Atlantic urbanization grew from 8% in 1300, 10.1% in 1500, to 24.5% in 1850; in other European countries from 10% in 1300, 11.4% in 1500, to 17% in 1850. Likewise, GDP doubled in Atlantic countries but rose by only 30% in the rest of Europe. By end of the 17th century the volume of the Trans-Atlantic trade had surpassed that of the Mediterranean trade.[67]\nThe Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves.[5]\nThe Atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, and precious stones.[68] Gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor, however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through. Currently, there is no cost-effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit.[69]\nVarious international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, marine debris, and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea.[5]\nThe shelves of the Atlantic hosts one of the world's richest fishing resources. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the Scotian Shelf, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Bay of Fundy, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks.[5] Fisheries have, however, undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the Atlantic: fisheries in the Eastern Central and South-West Atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value, the rest of the Atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks. The third group, \"continuously increasing trend since 1950\", is only found in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.[70]\nIn the North-East Atlantic total catches decreased between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons in 2013. Blue whiting reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628,000 tons in 2013. Recovery plans for cod, sole, and plaice have reduced mortality in these species. Arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1980s but is now recovered. Arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished; Sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished. Limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep-water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing. Stocks of northern shrimp and Norwegian lobster are in good condition. In the North-East Atlantic 21% of stocks are considered overfished.[70]\nIn the North-West Atlantic landings have decreased from 4.2 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013. During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including Greenland halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.[70]\nIn 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as \"Newfoundland Currency\" this discovery supplied mankind with some 200\u00c2\u00a0million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, witch flounder, and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including American plaice, redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.[71]\nIn the Eastern Central Atlantic small pelagic fishes constitute about 50% of landings with sardine reaching 0.6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.0 million tons per year. Pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fishes or overfished, with sardines south of Cape Bojador the notable exception. Almost half of stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels. Total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s; reaching 3.9 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010.[70]\nIn the Western Central Atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013. The most important species in the area, Gulf menhaden, reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished. Round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished. Groupers and snappers are overfished and northern brown shrimp and American cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching overfished. 44% of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels.[70]\nIn the South-East Atlantic catches have decreased from 3.3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.3 million tons in 2013. Horse mackerel and hake are the most important species, together representing almost half of the landings. Off South Africa and Namibia deep-water hake and shallow-water Cape hake have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of Southern African pilchard and anchovy have improved to fully fished in 2013.[70]\nIn the South-West Atlantic a peak was reached in the mid-1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons. The most important species, the Argentine shortfin squid, which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value, is considered fully fished to overfished. Another important species was the Brazilian sardinella, with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished. Half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels: Whitehead\u2019s round herring has not yet reached fully fished but Cunene horse mackerel is overfished. The sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished.[70]\nEndangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles, and whales. Drift net fishing can kill dolphins, albatrosses and other seabirds (petrels, auks), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.[72] Municipal pollution comes from the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.\nNorth Atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature (SST) at tropical latitudes, changes that can be attributed to either the natural Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or to anthropogenic climate change.[73] A 2005 report indicated that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) slowed down by 30% between 1957 and 2004.[74] If the AMO were responsible for SST variability, the AMOC would have increased in strength, which is apparently not the case. Furthermore, it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity.[73] Therefore, these changes in SST must be caused by human activities.[75]\nThe ocean mixed layer plays an important role heat storage over seasonal and decadal time-scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and has a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer. This heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in a thermal expansion of the oceans which contribute to sea-level rise. 21st century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea-level rise five times greater than today, whilst melting of glaciers, including that of the Greenland ice-sheet, expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century, will probably result in a sea-level rise of 3\u20136\u00a0m over a millennium.[76]\nOn 7 June 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.\nMarine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.[77]\nMarine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.",

        "text": "The American entry into World War I came in April 1917, after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[1] as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.[2] Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.\nAs U.S. president, it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs: while the country was at peace, the domestic economy ran on a laissez-faire basis, with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France \u00e2\u20ac\u201d funds that were in large part used to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic. Until 1917, Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing, despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness. He did however expand the United States Navy.\nIn 1917, with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war, and with Britain and France low on credit, Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe,[3] while Germany's ally, the Ottoman Empire, clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East. In the same year, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican\u2013American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for \"a war to end all wars\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.[4]\nOn December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary.[5][6]\nU.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918.\nBritain used its large navy to prevent cargo vessels entering German ports, mainly by intercepting them in the North Sea between the coasts of Scotland and Norway. The wider sea approaches to Britain and France, their distance from German harbours and the smaller size of the German surface fleet all made it harder for Germany to reciprocate. Instead, Germany used submarines to lie in wait for, and then sink, merchant ships heading for enemy ports.\nThe United States insisted on maintaining the traditional rights of ships registered in neutral countries and protested strongly against American ships being intercepted or sunk: the British seized American ships for supposed violations, while the Germans sank them \u00e2\u20ac\u201d often without warning, in violation of international law that said sailors must be allowed an opportunity to reach their lifeboats. After several violations, Germany stopped this practice but in early 1917 she decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, in the hope that this would starve out the British before the Americans could make any effective military retaliation.\nThe British Royal Navy successfully stopped the shipment of most war supplies and food to Germany. Neutral American ships that tried to trade with Germany were seized or turned back by the Royal Navy who viewed such trade as in direct conflict with the Allies' war efforts. The strangulation came about very slowly, because Germany and its allies controlled extensive farmlands and raw materials. It was eventually successful because Germany and Austria-Hungary had decimated their agricultural production by taking so many farmers into their armies. By 1918, German cities were on the verge of starvation; the front-line soldiers were on short rations and were running out of essential supplies.[7]\nGermany also considered a blockade. \"England wants to starve us\", said Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the man who built the German fleet and who remained a key advisor to the Kaiser Wilhelm II. \"We can play the same game. We can bottle her up and destroy every ship that endeavors to break the blockade\".[8] Unable to challenge the more powerful Royal Navy on the surface, Tirpitz wanted to scare off merchant and passenger ships en route to Britain. He reasoned that since the island of Britain depended on imports of food, raw materials, and manufactured goods, scaring off a substantial number of the ships would effectively undercut its long-term ability to maintain an army on the Western Front. While Germany had only nine long-range U-boats at the start of the war, it had ample shipyard capacity to build the hundreds needed. However, the United States demanded that Germany respect the international agreements upon \"freedom of the seas\", which protected neutral American ships on the high seas from seizure or sinking by either belligerent. Furthermore, Americans insisted that the drowning of innocent civilians was barbaric and grounds for a declaration of war. The British frequently violated America's neutral rights by seizing ships.[9] Wilson's top advisor, Colonel Edward M. House commented that, \"The British have gone as far as they possibly could in violating neutral rights, though they have done it in the most courteous way\".[10] When Wilson protested British violations of American neutrality, the British backed down.\nGerman submarines torpedoed ships without warning, causing sailors and passengers to drown. Berlin explained that submarines were so vulnerable that they dared not surface near merchant ships that might be carrying guns and which were too small to rescue submarine crews. Britain armed most of its merchant ships with medium calibre guns that could sink a submarine, making above-water attacks too risky. In February 1915, the United States warned Germany about misuse of submarines. On April 22, the German Imperial Embassy warned U.S. citizens against boarding vessels to Britain, which would have to face German attack. On May 7, Germany torpedoed the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania, sinking her. This act of aggression caused the loss of 1,198 civilian lives, including 128 Americans. The sinking of a large, unarmed passenger ship, combined with the previous stories of atrocities in Belgium, shocked Americans and turned public opinion hostile to Germany, although not yet to the point of war. Wilson issued a warning to Germany that it would face \"strict accountability\" if it sank more neutral U.S. passenger ships.[11] Berlin acquiesced, ordering its submarines to avoid passenger ships.\nBy January 1917, however, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff decided that an unrestricted submarine blockade was the only way to achieve a decisive victory. They demanded that Kaiser Wilhelm order unrestricted submarine warfare be resumed. Germany knew this decision meant war with the United States, but they gambled that they could win before America's potential strength could be mobilized.[12] However, they overestimated how many ships they could sink and thus the extent Britain would be weakened. Finally, they did not foresee that convoys could and would be used to defeat their efforts. They believed that the United States was so weak militarily that it could not be a factor on the Western Front for more than a year. The civilian government in Berlin objected, but the Kaiser sided with his military.[13]\nThe beginning of war in Europe coincided with the end of the Recession of 1913\u20131914 in America. Exports to belligerent nations rose rapidly over the first four years of the War from $824.8 million in 1913 to $2.25 billion in 1917.[14] Loans from American financial institutions to the Allied nations in Europe also increased dramatically over the same period.[15] Economic activity towards the end of this period boomed as government resources aided the production of the private sector. Between 1914 and 1917, industrial production increased 32% and GNP increased by almost 20%.[16] The improvements to industrial production in the United States outlasted the war. The capital build-up that had allowed American companies to supply belligerents and the American army resulted in a greater long-run rate of production even after the war had ended in 1918.[17]\nIn 1913, J. P. Morgan, Jr. took over the House of Morgan, an American-based investment bank consisting of separate banking operations in New York, London, and Paris, after the death of his father, J. Pierpont Morgan.[15] The House of Morgan offered assistance in the wartime financing of Britain and France from the earliest stages of the war in 1914 through America's entrance in 1917. J.P. Morgan & Co., the House of Morgan's bank in New York, was designated as the primary financial agent to the British government in 1914 after successful lobbying by the British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring Rice.[15] The same bank would later take a similar role in France and would offer extensive financial assistance to both warring nations. J.P. Morgan &Co. became the primary issuer of loans to the French government by raising money from American investors.[15] Morgan, Harjes, the House of Morgan's French affiliated bank, controlled the majority of the wartime financial dealings between the House of Morgan and the French government after primary issuances of debt in American markets.[15] Relations between the House of Morgan and the French government became tense as the war raged on with no end in sight.[15] France's ability to borrow from other sources diminished, leading to greater lending rates and a depressing of the value of the franc. After the war, in 1918, J.P. Morgan & Co. continued to aid the French government financially through monetary stabilization and debt relief.[15]\nBecause America was still a declared neutral state, the financial dealings of American banks in Europe caused a great deal of contention between Wall Street and the U.S. government. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan strictly opposed financial support of warring nations and wanted to ban loans to the belligerents in August 1914.[15] He told President Wilson that \"refusal to loan to any belligerent would naturally tend to hasten a conclusion of the war.\" Wilson at first agreed, but then reversed himself when France argued that if it was legal to buy American goods then it was legal to take out credits on the purchase.[18]\nJ.P. Morgan issued loans to France including one in March 1915 and, following negotiations with the Anglo-French Financial Commission, another joint loan to Britain and France in October 1915, the latter amounting to US$500,000,000.[15] Although the stance of the U.S. government was that stopping such financial assistance could hasten the end of the war and therefore save lives, little was done to insure adherence to the ban on loans, in part due to pressure from Allied governments and American business interests.[15]\nThe American steel industry had faced difficulties and declining profits during the Recession of 1913\u20131914.[19] As war began in Europe, however, the increased demand for tools of war began a period of heightened productivity that alleviated many U.S. industrial companies from the low-growth environment of the recession. Bethlehem Steel took particular advantage of the increased demand for armaments abroad. Prior to American entrance into the War, these companies benefitted from unrestricted commerce with sovereign customers abroad. After President Wilson issued his declaration of war, the companies were subjected to price controls created by the U.S. Trade Commission in order to insure that the U.S. military would have access to the necessary armaments.[19]\nBy the end of the war in 1918, Bethlehem Steel had produced 65,000 pounds of forged military products and 70 million pounds of armor plate, 1.1 billion pounds of steel for shells, and 20.1 million rounds of artillery ammunition for Britain and France.[20] Bethlehem Steel took advantage of the domestic armaments market and produced 60% of the American weaponry and 40% of the artillery shells used in the War.[20] Even with price controls and a lower profit margin on manufactured goods, the profits resulting from wartime sales expanded the company into the third largest manufacturing company in the country. Bethlehem Steel became the primary arms supplier for the United States and other allied powers again in 1939.[20]\nHistorians divide the views of American political and social leaders into four distinct groupings\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe camps were mostly informal:\nThe first of these were the Non-Interventionists, a loosely affiliated and politically diverse anti-war movement which sought to keep the United States out of the war altogether. Members of this group tended to view the war as a clash between British imperialism and German militarism, both of which they regarded as equally corrupt. Others were pacifists, who objected on moral grounds. Prominent leaders included Democrats like former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, industrialist Henry Ford and publisher William Randolph Hearst; Republicans Robert M. La Follette, Senator from Wisconsin and George W. Norris, Senator from Nebraska; and Progressive Party activist Jane Addams.\nAt the far-left end of the political spectrum the Socialists, led by their perennial candidate for President Eugene V. Debs and movement veterans like Victor L. Berger and Morris Hillquit, were staunch anti-militarists and opposed to any US intervention, branding the conflict as a \"capitalist war\" that American workers should avoid. However, after the US did join the war in April, 1917 a schism developed between the anti-war Party majority and a pro-war faction of Socialist writers, journalists and intellectuals led by John Spargo, William English Walling and E. Haldeman-Julius. This group founded the rival Social Democratic League of America to promote the war effort among their fellow Socialists.[21]\nNext were the more moderate Liberal-Internationalists. This bipartisan group reluctantly supported a declaration of war against Germany with the postwar goal of establishing collective international security institutions designed to peacefully resolve future conflicts between nations and to promote liberal democratic values more broadly. This groups's views were advocated by interest groups such as the League to Enforce Peace. Adherents included US President Woodrow Wilson, his influential advisor Edward M. House, former President William Howard Taft, famed inventor Alexander Graham Bell, Wall Street financier Bernard Baruch and Harvard University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell.[19]\nFinally, there were the so-called Atlanticists. Ardently pro-Entente, they had strongly championed American intervention in the war since 1915. Their primary political motivation was to both prepare the US for war with Germany and to forge an enduring military alliance with Great Britain. This group actively supported the Preparedness Movement and was strong among the Anglophile political establishment of the northeast, boasting such luminaries as former President Theodore Roosevelt, Major General Leonard Wood, prominent attorney and diplomat Joseph Hodges Choate, former Secretary of War Henry Stimson, journalist Walter Lippman and Senators Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr. of Massachusetts and Elihu Root of New York.[22]\nA cosmopolitan group of upper and upper-middle class businessmen based in the largest cities took the lead in promoting military preparedness and in defining how far America could be pushed around before it would fight back. Many public figures hated war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSecretary of State William Jennings Bryan was the most prominent, and he resigned when he thought Wilson had become too bellicose.[23] Grassroots opposition to American entry came especially from German and Irish elements.[24][25]\nA surprising factor in the development of American public opinion was how little the political parties became involved. Wilson and the Democrats in 1916 campaigned on the slogan \"He kept us out of war!\", saying a Republican victory would mean war with both Mexico and Germany. His position probably was critical in winning the Western states.[26] Charles Evans Hughes, the GOP candidate, insisted on downplaying the war issue.[27]\nThe Socialist party talked peace. Socialist rhetoric declared the European conflict to be \"an imperialist war\". It won 2% of the 1916 vote for Eugene V. Debs, blamed the war on capitalism and pledged total opposition. \"A bayonet\", its propaganda said, \"was a weapon with a worker at each end\".[28] When war began, however, about half the Socialists, typified by Congressman Meyer London, supported the decision and sided with the pro-Allied efforts. The rest, led by Debs, remained ideological and die-hard opponents.[29] Many socialists came under investigation from the Espionage Act of 1917 and many suspected of treason were arrested, including Debs. This would only increase the Socialist's anti-war groups in resentment toward the American government.[30]\nThe working class was relatively quiet, and tended to divide along ethnic lines. At the beginning of the war, neither working men nor farmers took a large interest in the debates on war preparation.[31][32][33] Samuel Gompers, head of the AFL labor movement, denounced the war in 1914 as \"unnatural, unjustified, and unholy\", but by 1916 he was supporting Wilson's limited preparedness program, against the objections of Socialist union activists. In 1916 the labor unions supported Wilson on domestic issues and ignored the war question.[34]\nThe war at first disrupted the cotton market; Britain blockaded shipments to Germany, and prices fell from 11 cents a pound to only 4 cents. By 1916, however, the British decided to bolster the price to 10 cents to avoid losing Southern support. The cotton growers seem to have moved from neutrality to intervention at about the same pace as the rest of the nation.[35][36] Midwestern farmers generally opposed the war, especially those of German and Scandinavian descent. The Midwest became the stronghold of isolationism; other remote rural areas also saw no need for war.[37]\nThe African-American community did not take a strong position one way or the other. A month after congress declared war, W. E. B. Du Bois called on African-Americans to \"fight shoulder to shoulder with the world to gain a world where war shall be no more\".[38] Once war began and black men were drafted, they worked to achieve equality.[39] Many had hoped the community's help in the war efforts abroad would earn civil rights at home. When such civil liberties were still not granted, many African-Americans grew tired of waiting for recognition of their rights as American citizens.[40]\nThere was a strong antiwar element in the white South and border states. In rural Missouri for example, distrust of powerful Eastern influences focused on the risk that Wall Street would lead America into war.[41] Across the South poor white farmers warned each other that \"a rich man's war meant a poor man's fight,\" and they wanted nothing of it.[42] Congressman James Hay, Democrat of Virginia was the powerful chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs. He repeatedly blocked prewar efforts to modernize and enlarge the army. Preparedness was not needed because Americans were already safe, he insisted in January 1915:\nGerman Americans by this time usually had only weak ties to Germany; however, they were fearful of negative treatment they might receive if the United States entered the war (such mistreatment was already happening to German-descent citizens in Canada and Australia). Almost none called for intervening on Germany's side, instead calling for neutrality and speaking of the superiority of German culture. As more nations were drawn into the conflict, however, the English-languages press increasingly supporting Britain, while the German-American media called for neutrality while also defending Germany's position. Chicago's Germans worked to secure a complete embargo on all arms shipments to Europe. In 1916, large crowds in Chicago's Germania celebrated the Kaiser's birthday, something they had not done before the war.[44] German Americans in early 1917 still called for neutrality, but proclaimed that if a war came they would be loyal to the United States. By this point, they had been excluded almost entirely from national discourse on the subject.[45] Once war started, they were harassed in so many ways that historian Carl Wittke noted in 1936, it was \"one of the most difficult and humiliating experiences suffered by an ethnic group in American history.\"[46] German-American Socialists in Milwaukee, Wisconsin actively campaigned against entry into the war.[47]\nLeaders of most religious groups (except the Episcopalians) tended to pacifism, as did leaders of the woman's movement. The Methodists and Quakers among others were vocal opponents of the war.[48] President Wilson, who was a devout Presbyterian, would often frame the war in terms of good and evil in an appeal for religious support of the war.[49]\nA concerted effort was made by pacifists including Jane Addams, Oswald Garrison Villard, David Starr Jordan, Henry Ford, Lillian Wald, and Carrie Chapman Catt. Their goal was to encourage Wilson's efforts to mediate an end of the war by bringing the belligerents to the conference table.[50] Finally in 1917 Wilson convinced some of them that to be truly anti-war they needed to support what he promised would be \"a war to end all wars\".[51]\nOnce war was declared, the more liberal denominations, which had endorsed the Social Gospel, called for a war for righteousness that would help uplift all mankind. The theme\u2014an aspect of American exceptionalism\u2014was that God had chosen America as his tool to bring redemption to the world.[52]\nAmerican Catholic bishops maintained a general silence toward the issue of intervention. Millions of Catholics lived in both warring camps, and Catholic Americans tended to split on ethnic lines in their opinions toward American involvement in the war. At the time, heavily Catholic towns and cities in the East and Midwest often contained multiple parishes, each serving a single ethnic group, such as Irish, German, Italian, Polish, or English. American Catholics of Irish and German descent opposed intervention most strongly. Pope Benedict XV made several attempts to negotiate a peace. All of his efforts were rebuffed by both the Allies and the Germans, and throughout the war the Vatican maintained a policy of strict neutrality.\nJewish American sympathies likewise broke along ethnic lines, with recently arrived Yiddish speaking Jews inclined to Zionism, and the established German-American Jewish community largely opposed to it. In 1914\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1916, there were few Jewish forces in favor of American entry into the war. Many regarded Britain as hostile to Jewish interests. New York City, with its well-organized element numbering 1.5 million Jews, was the center of antiwar activism.[53][54]\nThe different Jewish communities worked together during the war years to provide relief to Jewish communities in Eastern Europe.[55][56]\nOf greatest concern to Jews was the tsarist regime in Russia because it was notorious for tolerating pogroms and following anti-Semitic policies. As historian Joseph Rappaport reported through his study of Yiddish press during the war, \"The pro-Germanism of America's immigrant Jews was an inevitable consequence of their Russophobia\".[57] The fall of the tsarist regime in March 1917 removed a major obstacle for many Jews who refused to support tsarism.[58] The draft went smoothly in New York City, and left-wing opposition to the war largely collapsed when Zionists saw the possibility of using the war to demand a state of Israel.[59]\nThe most effective domestic opponents of the war were Irish-American Catholics. They had little interest in the continent, but were neutral about helping the United Kingdom because it had recently enacted the Government of Ireland Act 1914, allowing Irish Home Rule. However, the Act was suspended until the war ended. John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) declared that Irish Volunteers should support America's pro-Allied war efforts first; his political opponents argued that it was not the time to support Britain in its attempt to \"strengthen and expand her empire\".[60] The attacks on the IPP and pro-Allied press showed a firm belief that a German victory would hasten the achievement of Irish independence. Yet rather than proposing intervention on behalf of the Germans, Irish American leaders and organizations focused on demanding American neutrality. But the increased contact between militant Irish nationalists and German agents in the United States only fueled concerns of where the primary loyalties of Irish Americans lay.[61] Nevertheless, close to 1,000 Irish-born Americans died fighting with the U.S. armed forces in WWI.[62]\nThe Easter Rising in Dublin in April 1916 was crushed within a week and its leaders executed by firing squad. The mainstream American press treated the uprising as foolish and misguided, and theorized it was largely inspired by the Germans. Overall public opinion remained faithfully pro-British.[63]\nIrish-Americans dominated the Democratic party in many large cities so Wilson had to take account of their views. They did not prevent him from being hostile to Germany, but they did force him to keep his distance from Britain. Indeed, Irish-American pressure influenced the United States into not accepting Britain's war aims as its own and define its own objectives, primarily self-determination. The Irish-American community thought they had Wilson's promise to promote Irish independence in exchange for their support of his war policies, but after the war they were bitterly disappointed by his refusal to support them in 1919.[64] Wilson saw the Irish situation purely as an internal UK matter and did not perceive the dispute and the unrest in Ireland as comparable to the plight of the various nationalities in Europe as a fall-out from World War I.[65] The progress of the Irish Race Conventions give a flavour of the differing and changing opinions during the war.\nSome British immigrants worked actively for intervention. London-born Samuel Insull, Chicago's leading industrialist, for example, enthusiastically provided money, propaganda, and means for volunteers to enter the British or Canadian armies. After the United States' entry, Insull directed the Illinois State Council of Defense, with responsibility for organizing the state's mobilization.[66]\nImmigrants from eastern Europe usually cared more about politics in their homeland than politics in the United States. Spokesmen for Slavic immigrants hoped that an Allied victory would bring independence for their homelands.[67] Large numbers of Hungarian immigrants who were liberal and nationalist in sentiment, and sought an independent Hungary, separate from the Austro-Hungarian Empire lobbied in favor of the war and allied themselves with the Atlanticist or Anglophile portion of the population. This community was largely pro-British and anti-German in sentiment.[68][69][70] Albanian-Americans in communities such as Boston also campaigned for entry into the war and were overwhelmingly pro-British and anti-German, as well as hopeful the war would lead to an independent Albania which would be free from the Ottoman Empire.[71] Polish, Slovak, and Czech immigrants were enthusiastically pro-war and generally pro-British.\nHenry Ford supported the pacifist cause by sponsoring a large-scale private peace mission, with numerous activists and intellectuals aboard the \"Peace Ship' (the ocean liner Oscar II). Ford chartered the ship in 1915 and invited prominent peace activists to join him to meet with leaders on both sides in Europe. He hoped to create enough publicity to prompt the belligerent nations to convene a peace conference and mediate an end to the war. The mission was widely mocked by the press, which wrote about the \"Ship of Fools.\" Infighting between the activists, mockery by the press contingent aboard, and an outbreak of influenza marred the voyage. Four days after the ship arrived in neutral Norway, a beleaguered and physically ill Ford abandoned the mission and returned to the United States; he had demonstrated that independent small efforts accomplished nothing.[73]\nOn July 24, 1915, the German embassy's commercial attach\u00e9, Heinrich Albert, left his briefcase on a train in New York City, where an alert Secret Service agent, Frank Burke, snatched it up.[74] Wilson let the newspapers publish the contents, which indicated a systematic effort by Berlin to subsidize friendly newspapers and block British purchases of war materials. Berlin's top espionage agent, debonnaire Franz Rintelen von Kleist was spending millions to finance sabotage in Canada, stir up trouble between the United States and Mexico and to incite labor strikes. The British were engaged in propaganda too, though not illegal espionage. But they did not get caught.[75] Germany took the blame as Americans grew ever more worried about the vulnerability of a free society to subversion. Indeed, one of the main fears Americans of all stations had in 1916\u20131919 was that spies and saboteurs were everywhere. This sentiment played a major role in arousing fear of Germany, and suspicions regarding everyone of German descent who could not \"prove\" 100% loyalty.[76]\nBy 1915, Americans were paying much more attention to the war. The sinking of the Lusitania had a strong effect on public opinion because of the deaths of American civilians. That year, a strong \"Preparedness\" movement emerged.[77] Proponents argued that the United States needed to immediately build up strong naval and land forces for defensive purposes; an unspoken assumption was that America would fight sooner or later. General Leonard Wood (still on active duty after serving a term as Chief of Staff of the Army), former president Theodore Roosevelt, and former secretaries of war Elihu Root and Henry Stimson were the driving forces behind Preparedness, along with many of the nation's most prominent bankers, industrialists, lawyers and scions of prominent families. Indeed, there emerged an \"Atlanticist\" foreign policy establishment, a group of influential Americans drawn primarily from upper-class lawyers, bankers, academics, and politicians of the Northeast, committed to a strand of Anglophile internationalism. Representative was Paul D. Cravath, one of New York's foremost corporation lawyers. For Cravath, in his mid-fifties when the war began, the conflict served as an epiphany, sparking an interest in international affairs that dominated his remaining career. Fiercely Anglophile, he strongly supported American intervention in the war and hoped that close Anglo-American cooperation would be the guiding principle of postwar international organization.[78]\nThe Preparedness movement had a \"realistic\" philosophy of world affairs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey believed that economic strength and military muscle were more decisive than idealistic crusades focused on causes like democracy and national self-determination. Emphasizing over and over the weak state of national defenses, they showed that America's 100,000-man Army even augmented by the 112,000 National Guardsmen, was outnumbered 20 to one by Germany's army, which was drawn from a smaller population. Similarly in 1915, the armed forces of Great Britain and the British empire (the world's most powerful military and economic power at the time[79]), France, Russia, the Austro-Hungarian empire, Ottoman empire, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Belgium, Japan and Greece were all larger and more experienced than the United States military, in many cases significantly so.[80]\nReform to them meant UMT or \"universal military training\". They proposed a national service program under which the 600,000 men who turned 18 every year would be required to spend six months in military training, and afterwards be assigned to reserve units. The small regular army would primarily be a training agency.\nAntimilitarists complained the plan would make America resemble Germany (which required two years' active duty). Advocates retorted that military \"service\" was an essential duty of citizenship, and that without the commonality provided by such service the nation would splinter into antagonistic ethnic groups. One spokesman promised that UMT would become \"a real melting pot, under which the fire is hot enough to fuse the elements into one common mass of Americanism\". Furthermore, they promised, the discipline and training would make for a better paid work force. Hostility to military service was strong at the time, and the program failed to win approval. In World War II, when Stimson as Secretary of War proposed a similar program of universal peacetime service, he was defeated.[81]\nUnderscoring its commitment, the Preparedness movement set up and funded its own summer training camps at Plattsburgh, New York, and other sites, where 40,000 college alumni became physically fit, learned to march and shoot, and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps.[82] Suggestions by labor unions that talented working-class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored. The Preparedness movement was distant not only from the working classes but also from the middle-class leadership of most of small-town America. It had had little use for the National Guard, which it saw as politicized, localistic, poorly armed, ill trained, too inclined to idealistic crusading (as against Spain in 1898), and too lacking in understanding of world affairs. The National Guard on the other hand was securely rooted in state and local politics, with representation from a very broad cross section of American society. The Guard was one of the nation's few institutions that (in some northern states) accepted blacks on an equal footing.\nThe Democratic party saw the Preparedness movement as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to the rich and powerful in the first place. Working with the Democrats who controlled Congress, Wilson was able to sidetrack the Preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress to the effect that the nation's military was in excellent shape.\nIn fact, neither the Army nor Navy was in shape for war. The Navy had fine ships but Wilson had been using them to threaten Mexico, and the fleet's readiness had suffered. The crews of the Texas and the New York, the two newest and largest battleships, had never fired a gun, and the morale of the sailors was low. In addition, it was outnumbered and outgunned by the British, German, French, and Italian navies. The Army and Navy air forces were tiny in size. Despite the flood of new weapons systems unveiled by the British, Germans, French, Austro-Hungarians, Italians, and others in the war in Europe, the Army was paying scant attention. For example, it was making no studies of trench warfare, poison gas, heavy artillery, or tanks and was utterly unfamiliar with the rapid evolution of Aerial warfare. The Democrats in Congress tried to cut the military budget in 1915. The Preparedness movement effectively exploited the surge of outrage over the Lusitania in May 1915, forcing the Democrats to promise some improvements to the military and naval forces. Wilson, less fearful of the Navy, embraced a long-term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the British Royal Navy by the mid-1920s, although this would not be achieved until World War II. \"Realism\" was at work here; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to none\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, equal to Britain. The facts of submarine warfare (which necessitated destroyers, not battleships) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany (or with Britain, for that matter), were simply ignored.\nWilson's program for the Army touched off a firestorm.[83] Secretary of War Lindley Garrison adopted many of the proposals of the Preparedness leaders, especially their emphasis on a large federal reserve and abandonment of the National Guard. Garrison's proposals not only outraged the localistic politicians of both parties, they also offended a strongly held belief shared by the liberal wing of the Progressive movement. They felt that warfare always had a hidden economic motivation. Specifically, they warned the chief warmongers were New York bankers (like J. P. Morgan) with millions at risk, profiteering munition makers (like Bethlehem Steel, which made armor, and DuPont, which made powder) and unspecified industrialists searching for global markets to control. Antiwar critics blasted them. These special interests were too powerful, especially, Senator La Follette noted, in the conservative wing of the Republican Party. The only road to peace was disarmament, reiterated Bryan.\nGarrison's plan unleashed the fiercest battle in peacetime history over the relationship of military planning to national goals. In peacetime, War Department arsenals and Navy yards manufactured nearly all munitions that lacked civilian uses, including warships, artillery, naval guns, and shells. Items available on the civilian market, such as food, horses, saddles, wagons, and uniforms were always purchased from civilian contractors. Armor plate (and after 1918, airplanes) was an exception that has caused unremitting controversy for a century. After World War II, the arsenals and Navy yards were much less important than giant civilian aircraft and electronics firms, which became the second half of the \"military-industrial complex\" Peace leaders like Jane Addams of Hull House and David Starr Jordan of Stanford redoubled their efforts, and now turned their voices against the president because he was \"sowing the seeds of militarism, raising up a military and naval caste\". Many ministers, professors, farm spokesmen, and labor union leaders joined in, with powerful support from a band of four dozen southern Democrats in Congress who took control of the House Military Affairs Committee. Wilson, in deep trouble, took his cause to the people in a major speaking tour in early 1916, a warmup for his reelection campaign that fall. Wilson seems to have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson replaced Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness (Garrison kept quiet, but felt Wilson was \"a man of high ideals but no principles\"). The upshot was a compromise passed in May 1916, as the war raged on and Berlin was debating whether America was so weak it could be ignored. The Army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserve, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburg model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant. America would now be too weak to go to war. Colonel Robert L. Bullard privately complained that \"Both sides [Britain and Germany] treat us with scorn and contempt; our fool, smug conceit of superiority has been exploded in our faces and deservedly.\" The House gutted the naval plans as well, defeating a \"big navy\" plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. The battle of Jutland (May 31/June 1, 1916) was used by the navalists to argue for the primacy of seapower; they then took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships. A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armor plate factory. The very weakness of American military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with America, but it could discount the immediate risk because the U.S. Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919 by which time the war would be over, with Germany victorious. The notion that armaments led to war was turned on its head: refusal to arm in 1916 led to war in 1917.\nAmericans felt an increasing need for a military that could command respect. As one editor put it, \"The best thing about a large army and a strong navy is that they make it so much easier to say just what we want to say in our diplomatic correspondence.\" Berlin thus far had backed down and apologized when Washington was angry, thus boosting American self-confidence. America's rights and America's honor increasingly came into focus. The slogan \"Peace\" gave way to \"Peace with Honor\". The Army remained unpopular, however. A recruiter in Indianapolis noted that, \"The people here do not take the right attitude towards army life as a career, and if a man joins from here he often tries to go out on the quiet\". The Preparedness movement used its easy access to the mass media to demonstrate that the War Department had no plans, no equipment, little training, no reserve, a laughable National Guard, and a wholly inadequate organization for war. Motion pictures like The Battle Cry of Peace (1915) depicted invasions of the American homeland that demanded action.[84]\nThe readiness and capability of the U.S. Navy was a matter of controversy. The press at the time reported that the only thing the military was ready for was an enemy fleet attempting to seize New York harbor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat a time when the German battle fleet was penned up by the Royal Navy. The Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels was a journalist with pacifist leanings.[85] He had built up the educational resources of the Navy and made its Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island an essential experience for would-be admirals. However, he alienated the officer corps with his moralistic reforms, including no wine in the officers' mess, no hazing at the Naval Academy, and more chaplains and YMCAs. Daniels, as a newspaperman, knew the value of publicity. In 1915 he set up the Naval Consulting Board headed by Thomas Edison to obtain the advice and expertise of leading scientists, engineers, and industrialists. It popularized technology, naval expansion, and military preparedness, and was well covered in the media.[86] But according to Coletta he ignored the nation's strategic needs, and disdaining the advice of its experts, Daniels suspended meetings of the Joint Army and Navy Board for two years because it was giving unwelcome advice, chopped in half the General Board's recommendations for new ships, reduced the authority of officers in the Navy yards where ships were built and repaired, and ignored the administrative chaos in his department. Bradley Fiske, one of the most innovative admirals in American naval history, in 1914 was Daniels' top aide; he recommended a reorganization that would prepare for war, but Daniels refused. Instead he replaced Fiske in 1915 and brought in for the new post of Chief of Naval Operations an unknown captain, William Benson. Chosen for his compliance, Benson proved a wily bureaucrat who was more interested in preparing for an eventual showdown with Britain than an immediate one with Germany. Benson told Sims he \"would as soon fight the British as the Germans\". Proposals to send observers to Europe were blocked, leaving the Navy in the dark about the success of the German submarine campaign. Admiral William Sims charged after the war that in April 1917, only ten percent of the Navy's warships were fully manned; the rest lacked 43% of their seamen. Light antisubmarine ships were few in number, as if Daniels had been unaware of the German submarine menace that had been the focus of foreign policy for two years. The Navy's only warfighting plan, the \"Black Plan\" assumed the Royal Navy did not exist and that German battleships were moving freely about the Atlantic and the Caribbean and threatening the Panama Canal. Daniels' tenure would have been even less successful save for the energetic efforts of Assistant Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt, who effectively ran the Department.[85] His most recent biographer concludes that, \"it is true that Daniels had not prepared the navy for the war it would have to fight.\"[87]\nBy 1916 a new factor was emerging\u2014a sense of national self-interest and American nationalism. The unbelievable casualty figures in Europe were sobering\u2014two vast battles caused over one million casualties each. Clearly this war would be a decisive episode in the history of the world. Every American effort to find a peaceful solution was frustrated.\nKendrick Clements claims bureaucratic decision-making was one of the main sources pushing the United States to declaring war on Germany and aligning itself with the Allies. He cites the State Department's demand that Germany's submarines obey outdated, 18th century sailing laws as one of the first missteps by the United States bureaucracy regarding the war. By doing so, the United States had essentially given Germany the choice of whether or not the U.S. would enter the war. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan spent most of the fall of 1914 out of contact with the State Department, leaving the more conservative Robert Lansing with the ability to shape American foreign policy at the time. One of these decisions was made in response to British protests that the Germans were using U.S. radio towers to send messages to their warships. Immediately prior to the war starting in 1914, Britain had cut all cable communications leading out of Germany, including the trans-Atlantic cable. The US Government permitted German embassies to use the US cable lines for \"proper\" diplomatic business. Germany argued that usage of the towers was necessary to allow efficient contact between the U.S. and Germany. Lansing responded by requiring both sides to give the U.S. Navy copies of the messages they sent over the towers. The French and British were still able to use the cables, forcing Germany to be the only belligerent required to provide the U.S. with their messages. This and other seemingly small decisions made by Lansing during this time would eventually stack up, shifting American support towards the Allies.[88]\nOnce Germany had decided on unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, and knowing it would be attacking all American ships in the North Atlantic, it tried to line up new allies, especially Mexico. Arthur Zimmermann, the German foreign minister, sent the Zimmermann Telegram to Mexico on January 16, 1917. Zimmerman invited Mexico (knowing their resentment towards America since the 1848 Mexican Cession) to join in a war against the United States. Germany promised to pay for Mexico's costs and to help it recover the territory annexed by the U.S. in 1848. These territories included the present day states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, about half of New Mexico and a quarter of Colorado. British intelligence intercepted and decoded the telegram and passed it to the Wilson administration. The White House would release it to the press on March 1st. Anger grew further as the Germans began sinking American ships, even as isolationists in the Senate launched a filibuster to block legislation for arming American merchant ships to defend themselves.[89][90]\nIn early 1917 Berlin forced the issue. Its declared decision on 31 January 1917 to target neutral shipping in a designated war-zone[91] became the immediate cause of the entry of the United States into the war.[92] Five American merchant ships went down in March. Outraged public opinion now overwhelmingly supported Wilson when he asked Congress for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917.[93]\nHistorians such as Ernest R. May have approached the process of American entry into the war as a study in how public opinion changed radically in three years' time. In 1914 most Americans called for neutrality, seeing the war a dreadful mistake and were determined to stay out. By 1917 the same public felt just as strongly that going to war was both necessary and wise. Military leaders had little to say during this debate, and military considerations were seldom raised. The decisive questions dealt with morality and visions of the future. The prevailing attitude was that America possessed a superior moral position as the only great nation devoted to the principles of freedom and democracy. By staying aloof from the squabbles of reactionary empires, it could preserve those ideals\u2014sooner or later the rest of the world would come to appreciate and adopt them. In 1917 this very long-run program faced the severe danger that in the short run powerful forces adverse to democracy and freedom would triumph. Strong support for moralism came from religious leaders, women (led by Jane Addams), and from public figures like long-time Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of State from 1913 to 1916. The most important moralist of all was President Woodrow Wilson\u2014the man who dominated decision making so totally that the war has been labelled, from an American perspective, \"Wilson's War\".[94]\nIn 1917 Wilson won the support of most of the moralists by proclaiming \"a war to make the world safe for democracy.\" If they truly believed in their ideals, he explained, now was the time to fight. The question then became whether Americans would fight for what they deeply believed in, and the answer turned out to be a resounding \"Yes\".[95]\nAntiwar activists at the time and in the 1930s, alleged that beneath the veneer of moralism and idealism there must have been ulterior motives. Some suggested a conspiracy on the part of New York City bankers holding $3 billion of war loans to the Allies, or steel and chemical firms selling munitions to the Allies.[96] The interpretation was popular among left-wing Progressives (led by Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin) and among the \"agrarian\" wing of the Democratic party\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee of the House. He strenuously opposed war, and when it came he rewrote the tax laws to make sure the rich paid the most. (In the 1930s neutrality laws were passed to prevent financial entanglements from dragging the nation into a war.) In 1915, Bryan thought that Wilson's pro-British sentiments had distorted his policies, so he became the first Secretary of State ever to resign in protest.[97]\nHowever, historian Harold C. Syrett argues that business supported neutrality.[98] Other historians state that the pro-war element was animated not by profit but by disgust with what Germany actually did, especially in Belgium, and the threat it represented to American ideals. Belgium kept the public's sympathy as the Germans executed civilians,[99] and English nurse Edith Cavell. American engineer Herbert Hoover led a private relief effort that won wide support. Compounding the Belgium atrocities were new weapons that Americans found repugnant, like poison gas and the aerial bombardment of innocent civilians as Zeppelins dropped bombs on London.[94] Even anti-war spokesmen did not claim that Germany was innocent, and pro-German scripts were poorly received.[100]\nRandolph Bourne criticized the moralist philosophy claiming it was a justification by American intellectual and power elites, like President Wilson, for going to war unnecessarily. He argues that the push for war started with the Preparedness movement, fueled by big business. While big business would not push much further than Preparedness, benefitting the most from neutrality, the movement would eventually evolve into a war-cry, led by war-hawk intellectuals under the guise of moralism. Bourne believes elites knew full well what going to war would entail and the price in American lives it would cost. If American elites could portray the United States' role in the war as noble, they could convince the generally isolationist American public war would be acceptable.[101]\nAbove all, American attitudes towards Germany focused on the U-boats (submarines), which sank the Lusitania in 1915 and other passenger ships \"without warning\".[102][103][104] That appeared to Americans as an unacceptable challenge to America's rights as a neutral country, and as an unforgivable affront to humanity. After repeated diplomatic protests, Germany agreed to stop. But in 1917 the Germany military leadership decided that \"military necessity\" dictated the unrestricted use of their submarines. The Kaiser's advisors felt America was enormously powerful economically but too weak militarily to make a difference.\nOn April 2, 1917, Wilson asked a special joint session of Congress to declare war on the German Empire, stating, \"We have no selfish ends to serve\".[105] To make the conflict seem like a better idea, he painted the conflict idealistically, stating that the war would \"make the world safe for democracy\" and later that it would be a \"war to end war\". The United States had a moral responsibility to enter the war, Wilson proclaimed. The future of the world was being determined on the battlefield, and American national interest demanded a voice. Wilson's definition of the situation won wide acclaim, and, indeed, has shaped America's role in world and military affairs ever since. Wilson believed that if the Central Powers won, the consequences would be bad for the United States. Germany would have dominated the continent and perhaps would gain control of the seas as well. Latin America could well have fallen under Berlin's control. The dream of spreading democracy, liberalism, and independence would have been shattered. On the other hand, if the Allies had won without help, there was a danger they would carve up the world without regard to American commercial interests. They were already planning to use government subsidies, tariff walls, and controlled markets to counter the competition posed by American businessmen. The solution was a third route, a \"peace without victory\", according to Wilson.[106]\nOn April 6, 1917, Congress declared war. In the Senate, the resolution passed 82 to 6, with Senators Harry Lane, William J. Stone, James Vardaman, Asle Gronna, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and George W. Norris voting against it. In the House, the declaration passed 373 to 50, with Claude Kitchin, a senior Democrat, notably opposing it. Another opponent was Jeannette Rankin, who alone voted against entry into both World War I and World War II. Nearly all of the opposition came from the West and the Midwest.[107]\nThe United States Senate, in a 74 to 0 vote, declared war on Austria-Hungary on December 7, 1917, citing Austria-Hungary's severing of diplomatic relations with the United States, its use of unrestricted submarine warfare and its alliance with Germany.[5] The declaration passed in the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 365 to 1.[6]",

        "text": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; \"Manhattan\" gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $2\u00a0billion (about $22\u00a0billion in 2016[1] dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\nTwo types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war: a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\nIn parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The Fat Man implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.\nThe project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project. Through Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet atomic spies successfully penetrated the program.\nThe first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the Trinity test, conducted at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of national laboratories, supported medical research into radiology and laid the foundations for the nuclear navy. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.\nThe discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries.[2] In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd and Eugene Wigner drafted the Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter, which warned of the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\". It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of uranium ore and accelerate the research of Enrico Fermi and others into nuclear chain reactions. They had it signed by Albert Einstein and delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt called on Lyman Briggs of the National Bureau of Standards to head the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the issues raised by the letter. Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szil\u00e1rd, Wigner and Edward Teller. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium \"would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known.\"[3]\nThe Advisory Committee on Uranium became the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) Committee on Uranium when that organization was formed on 27 June 1940.[4] Briggs proposed spending $167,000 on research into uranium, particularly the uranium-235 isotope, and the recently discovered plutonium.[5] On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD),[6] with Vannevar Bush as its director. The office was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research.[5] The NDRC Committee on Uranium became the S-1 Section of the OSRD; the word \"uranium\" was dropped for security reasons.[7]\nIn Britain, Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham had made a breakthrough investigating the critical mass of uranium-235 in June 1939.[8] Their calculations indicated that it was within an order of magnitude of 10 kilograms (22\u00a0lb), which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day.[9] Their March 1940 Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum initiated the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee,[10] which unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb.[9] In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research,[11] and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.[12]\nAs part of the scientific exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.[13][14]\nOn 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt approved the atomic program after he convened a meeting with Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself\u2014although he never attended a meeting\u2014Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort with that of the British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.[15]\nThe S-1 Committee held its meeting on 18 December 1941 \"pervaded by an atmosphere of enthusiasm and urgency\"[16] in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent United States declaration of war upon Japan and then on Germany.[17] Work was proceeding on three different techniques for isotope separation to separate uranium-235 from the more abundant uranium-238. Lawrence and his team at the University of California, Berkeley, investigated electromagnetic separation, while Eger Murphree and Jesse Wakefield Beams's team looked into gaseous diffusion at Columbia University, and Philip Abelson directed research into thermal diffusion at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and later the Naval Research Laboratory.[18] Murphree was also the head of an unsuccessful separation project using gas centrifuges.[19]\nMeanwhile, there were two lines of research into nuclear reactor technology, with Harold Urey continuing research into heavy water at Columbia, while Arthur Compton brought the scientists working under his supervision from Columbia, California and Princeton University to join his team at the University of Chicago, where he organized the Metallurgical Laboratory in early 1942 to study plutonium and reactors using graphite as a neutron moderator.[20] Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Murphree, and Urey met on 23 May 1942 to finalize the S-1 Committee recommendations, which called for all five technologies to be pursued. This was approved by Bush, Conant, and Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, the chief of staff of Major General Brehon B. Somervell's Services of Supply, who had been designated the Army's representative on nuclear matters.[18] Bush and Conant then took the recommendation to the Top Policy Group with a budget proposal for $54\u00a0million for construction by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, $31\u00a0million for research and development by OSRD and $5\u00a0million for contingencies in fiscal year 1943. The Top Policy Group in turn sent it to the President on 17 June 1942 and he approved it by writing \"OK FDR\" on the document.[18]\nCompton asked theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley, to take over research into fast neutron calculations\u2014the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation\u2014from Gregory Breit, who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security.[21] John H. Manley, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country.[22] Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois examined the problems of neutron diffusion\u2014how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction\u2014and hydrodynamics\u2014how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segr\u00e8, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Henry Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.[23]\nThere were still many unknown factors. The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, an element that had only been discovered in February 1941 by Glenn Seaborg and his team. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from cyclotrons.[24] Even by December 1943, only two milligrams had been produced.[25] There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a \"cylindrical plug\" into a sphere of \"active material\" with a \"tamper\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency.[26] They also explored designs involving spheroids, a primitive form of \"implosion\" suggested by Richard C. Tolman, and the possibility of autocatalytic methods, which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded.[27]\nConsidering the idea of the fission bomb theoretically settled\u2014at least until more experimental data was available\u2014the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the \"super\", now usually referred to as a \"hydrogen bomb\", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.[28] Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one. The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs.[29] Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might \"ignite\" the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei.[note 1] Bethe calculated that it could not happen,[31] and a report co-authored by Teller showed that \"no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started.\"[32] In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned it to Arthur Compton, who \"didn't have enough sense to shut up about it. It somehow got into a document that went to Washington\" and was \"never laid to rest\".[note 2]\nThe Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold, selected Colonel James C. Marshall to head the Army's part of the project in June 1942. Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' North Atlantic Division. It was close to the Manhattan office of Stone & Webster, the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University. He had permission to draw on his former command, the Syracuse District, for staff, and he started with Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, who became his deputy.[34][35]\nBecause most of his task involved construction, Marshall worked in cooperation with the head of the Corps of Engineers Construction Division, Major General Thomas M. Robbins, and his deputy, Colonel Leslie Groves. Reybold, Somervell and Styer decided to call the project \"Development of Substitute Materials\", but Groves felt that this would draw attention. Since engineer districts normally carried the name of the city where they were located, Marshall and Groves agreed to name the Army's component of the project the Manhattan District. This became official on 13 August, when Reybold issued the order creating the new district. Informally, it was known as the Manhattan Engineer District, or MED. Unlike other districts, it had no geographic boundaries, and Marshall had the authority of a division engineer. Development of Substitute Materials remained as the official codename of the project as a whole, but was supplanted over time by \"Manhattan\".[35]\nMarshall later conceded that, \"I had never heard of atomic fission but I did know that you could not build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90\u00a0million.\"[36] A single TNT plant that Nichols had recently built in Pennsylvania had cost $128\u00a0million.[37] Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests.[38] A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The War Production Board recommended sites around Knoxville, Tennessee, an isolated area where the Tennessee Valley Authority could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near Elza, Tennessee. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments before taking action.[39] Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.[40]\nMarshall and Nichols began assembling the resources they would need. The first step was to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose.[41] Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.[42]\nBush became dissatisfied with Colonel Marshall's failure to get the project moving forward expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by the Army and the location of his headquarters in New York City.[44] Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.[42]\nSomervell and Styer selected Groves for the post, informing him on 17 September of this decision, and that General Marshall ordered that he be promoted to brigadier general,[45] as it was felt that the title \"general\" would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project.[46] Groves' orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Colonel Marshall now answerable to Groves.[47] Groves established his headquarters in Washington, D.C., on the fifth floor of the New War Department Building, where Colonel Marshall had his liaison office.[48] He assumed command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September. Later that day, he attended a meeting called by Stimson, which established a Military Policy Committee, responsible to the Top Policy Group, consisting of Bush (with Conant as an alternate), Styer and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell.[45] Tolman and Conant were later appointed as Groves' scientific advisers.[49]\nOn 19 September, Groves went to Donald Nelson, the chairman of the War Production Board, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President.[50] Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944.[51] According to Groves, \"In Washington you became aware of the importance of top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority\".[52]\nOne of Groves' early problems was to find a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.[53][54]\nThe British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed Tube Alloys, because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb.[55] An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering to pay for all research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that if its offer was rejected, they should proceed alone.[56] The British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, did not have the resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival. As a result, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart.[57] and on 30 July 1942, Sir John Anderson, the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: \"We must face the fact that\u00a0... [our] pioneering work\u00a0... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.\"[58] That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.[59]\nThe opportunity for an equal partnership no longer existed, however, as shown in August 1942 when the British unsuccessfully demanded substantial control over the project while paying none of the costs. By 1943 the roles of the two countries had reversed from late 1941;[56] in January Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas. While the British were shocked by the abrogation of the Churchill-Roosevelt agreement, head of the Canadian National Research Council C. J. Mackenzie was less surprised, writing \"I can't help feeling that the United Kingdom group [over] emphasizes the importance of their contribution as compared with the Americans.\"[59] As Conant and Bush told the British, the order came \"from the top\".[60]\nThe British bargaining position had worsened; the American scientists had decided that the United States no longer needed outside help, and they wanted to prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war\u2014especially not bomb design\u2014even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them.[61] They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.[62]\nBy March 1943 Conant decided that British help would benefit some areas of the project. James Chadwick and one or two other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.[63] In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation[64] between scientists working on the same problem. Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb.[65] The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period.[66] The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member.[67] Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Sir John Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson.[68]\nWhen cooperation resumed after the Quebec agreement, the Americans' progress and expenditures amazed the British. The United States had already spent more than $1 billion ($11,400,000,000 today[1]), while in 1943, the United Kingdom had spent about \u00c2\u00a30.5 million. Chadwick thus pressed for British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent and abandon any hopes of a British project during the war.[62] With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honored.[69] The British Mission that arrived in the United States in December 1943 included Niels Bohr, Otto Frisch, Klaus Fuchs, Rudolf Peierls, and Ernest Titterton.[70] More scientists arrived in early 1944. While those assigned to gaseous diffusion left by the fall of 1944, the 35 working with Lawrence at Berkeley were assigned to existing laboratory groups and stayed until the end of the war. The 19 sent to Los Alamos also joined existing groups, primarily related to implosion and bomb assembly, but not the plutonium-related ones.[62] Part of the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.[71]\nThe Combined Policy Committee created the Combined Development Trust in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure uranium and thorium ores on international markets. The Belgian Congo and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the Belgian government in exile was in London. Britain agreed to give the United States most of the Belgian ore, as it could not use most of the supply without restricted American research.[72] In 1944, the Trust purchased 3,440,000 pounds (1,560,000\u00a0kg) of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the Belgian Congo. In order to avoid briefing US Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and the time he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5\u00a0million into the Trust's account.[73]\nGroves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them.[62] He also said that Churchill was \"the best friend the atomic bomb project had [as] he kept Roosevelt's interest up ... He just stirred him up all the time by telling him how important he thought the project was.\"[52]\nThe British wartime participation was crucial to the success of the United Kingdom's independent nuclear weapons program after the war when the McMahon Act of 1946 temporarily ended American nuclear cooperation.[62]\nThe day after he took over the project, Groves took a train to Tennessee with Colonel Marshall to inspect the proposed site there, and Groves was impressed.[75][76] On 29 September 1942, United States Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson authorized the Corps of Engineers to acquire 56,000 acres (23,000\u00a0ha) of land by eminent domain at a cost of $3.5\u00a0million. An additional 3,000 acres (1,200\u00a0ha) was subsequently acquired. About 1,000 families were affected by the condemnation order, which came into effect on 7 October.[77] Protests, legal appeals, and a 1943 Congressional inquiry were to no avail.[78] By mid-November U.S. Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.[79] Some families were given two weeks' notice to vacate farms that had been their homes for generations;[80] others had settled there after being evicted to make way for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1920s or the Norris Dam in the 1930s.[78] The ultimate cost of land acquisition in the area, which was not completed until March 1945, was only about $2.6\u00a0million, which worked out to around $47 an acre.[81] When presented with Public Proclamation Number Two, which declared Oak Ridge a total exclusion area that no one could enter without military permission, the Governor of Tennessee, Prentice Cooper, angrily tore it up.[82]\nInitially known as the Kingston Demolition Range, the site was officially renamed the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) in early 1943.[83] While Stone & Webster concentrated on the production facilities, the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed and built a residential community for 13,000. The community was located on the slopes of Black Oak Ridge, from which the new town of Oak Ridge got its name.[84] The Army presence at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall as head of the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge although the name of the district did not change.[85] In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company (for Roane and Anderson Counties, in which Oak Ridge was located).[86] Chemical engineers, including William J. Wilcox Jr. and Warren Fuchs, were part of \"frantic efforts\" to make 10% to 12% enriched uranium 235, known as the code name \"tuballoy tetroxide\", with tight security and fast approvals for supplies and materials.[87] The population of Oak Ridge soon expanded well beyond the initial plans, and peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works,[74] and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.[86]\nFine-arts photographer, Josephine Herrick, and her colleague, Mary Steers, helped document the work at Oak Ridge.[88]\nThe idea of locating Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, but in the end it was decided that it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico.[89] On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, it was hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project.[90][91] The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.[92]\nPatterson approved the acquisition of the site on 25 November 1942, authorizing $440,000 for the purchase of the site of 54,000 acres (22,000\u00a0ha), all but 8,900 acres (3,600\u00a0ha) of which were already owned by the Federal Government.[93] Secretary of Agriculture Claude R. Wickard granted use of some 45,100 acres (18,300\u00a0ha) of United States Forest Service land to the War Department \"for so long as the military necessity continues\".[94] The need for land, for a new road, and later for a right of way for a 25-mile (40\u00a0km) power line, eventually brought wartime land purchases to 45,737 acres (18,509.1\u00a0ha), but only $414,971 was spent.[93] Construction was contracted to the M. M. Sundt Company of Tucson, Arizona, with Willard C. Kruger and Associates of Santa Fe, New Mexico, as architect and engineer. Work commenced in December 1942. Groves initially allocated $300,000 for construction, three times Oppenheimer's estimate, with a planned completion date of 15 March 1943. It soon became clear that the scope of Project Y was greater than expected, and by the time Sundt finished on 30 November 1943, over $7\u00a0million had been spent.[95]\nBecause it was secret, Los Alamos was referred to as \"Site Y\" or \"the Hill\".[96] Birth certificates of babies born in Los Alamos during the war listed their place of birth as PO Box 1663 in Santa Fe.[97] Initially Los Alamos was to have been a military laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army. Oppenheimer went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department.[98]\nAn Army-OSRD council on 25 June 1942 decided to build a pilot plant for plutonium production in Red Gate Woods southwest of Chicago. In July, Nichols arranged for a lease of 1,025 acres (415\u00c2\u00a0ha) from the Cook County Forest Preserve District, and Captain James F. Grafton was appointed Chicago area engineer. It soon became apparent that the scale of operations was too great for the area, and it was decided to build the plant at Oak Ridge, and keep a research and testing facility in Chicago.[99][100]\nDelays in establishing the plant in Red Gate Woods led Compton to authorize the Metallurgical Laboratory to construct the first nuclear reactor beneath the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. The reactor required an enormous amount of graphite blocks and uranium pellets. At the time, there was a limited source of pure uranium. Frank Spedding of Iowa State University were able to produce only two short tons of pure uranium. Additional three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant which was produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by Goodyear Tire to encase the reactor.[101][102] On 2 December 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi initiated the first artificial[note 3] self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as Chicago Pile-1.[104] The point at which a reaction becomes self-sustaining became known as \"going critical\". Compton reported the success to Conant in Washington, D.C., by a coded phone call, saying, \"The Italian navigator [Fermi] has just landed in the new world.\"[105][note 4]\nIn January 1943, Grafton's successor, Major Arthur V. Peterson, ordered Chicago Pile-1 dismantled and reassembled at Red Gate Woods, as he regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area.[106] At the Argonne site, Chicago Pile-3, the first heavy water reactor, went critical on 15 May 1944.[107][108] After the war, the operations that remained at Red Gate moved to the new site of the Argonne National Laboratory about 6 miles (9.7\u00c2\u00a0km) away.[100]\nBy December 1942 there were concerns that even Oak Ridge was too close to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.[109]\nDuPont recommended that the site be located far from the existing uranium production facility at Oak Ridge.[110] In December 1942, Groves dispatched Colonel Franklin Matthias and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that Hanford Site near Richland, Washington, was \"ideal in virtually all respects\". It was isolated and near the Columbia River, which could supply sufficient water to cool the reactors that would produce the plutonium. Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works (HEW), codenamed \"Site W\".[111]\nUnder Secretary Patterson gave his approval on 9 February, allocating $5\u00a0million for the acquisition of 40,000 acres (16,000\u00a0ha) of land in the area. The federal government relocated some 1,500 residents of White Bluffs and Hanford, and nearby settlements, as well as the Wanapum and other tribes using the area. A dispute arose with farmers over compensation for crops, which had already been planted before the land was acquired. Where schedules allowed, the Army allowed the crops to be harvested, but this was not always possible.[111] The land acquisition process dragged on and was not completed before the end of the Manhattan Project in December 1946.[112]\nThe dispute did not delay work. Although progress on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict the scope of the project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site.[113] At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state.[114] Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago.[115] Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.[116]\nCominco had produced electrolytic hydrogen at Trail, British Columbia, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 that it could produce heavy water. To the existing $10\u00a0million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75\u00a0MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon catalyst for the first three stages while Urey developed a nickel-chromia one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8\u00a0million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for Chicago Pile 3, the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.[117]\nThe Chalk River, Ontario, site was established to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from an urban area. A new community was built at Deep River, Ontario, to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, Camp Petawawa. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first director of the new laboratory was Hans von Halban. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by Bennett Lewis in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as ZEEP (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970.[118] A larger 10\u00c2\u00a0MW NRX reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.[117]\nThe Eldorado Mine at Port Radium was a source of uranium ore.[119]\nAlthough DuPont's preferred designs for the nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator, DuPont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup, in case the graphite reactor design proved infeasible for some reason. For this purpose, it was estimated that 3 long tons (3.0\u00a0t) of heavy water would be required per month. The P-9 Project was the government's code name for the heavy water production program. As the plant at Trail, which was then under construction, could produce 0.5 long tons (0.51\u00a0t) per month, additional capacity was required. Groves therefore authorized DuPont to establish heavy water facilities at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near Morgantown, West Virginia; at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, near Dana and Newport, Indiana; and at the Alabama Ordnance Works, near Childersburg and Sylacauga, Alabama. Although known as Ordnance Works and paid for under Ordnance Department contracts, they were built and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The American plants used a process different from Trail's; heavy water was extracted by distillation, taking advantage of the slightly higher boiling point of heavy water.[120][121]\nThe key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in Joachimsthal in Czechoslovakia, and in the Belgian Congo.[122] All but Joachimstal were in allied hands. A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.[123] Nichols arranged with the State Department for export controls to be placed on uranium oxide and negotiated for the purchase of 1,200 long tons (1,200\u00c2\u00a0t) of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on Staten Island and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo. He negotiated with Eldorado Gold Mines for the purchase of ore from its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.[124]\nWhile these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The richest source of ore was the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with Edgar Sengier, the director of the company that owned the mine, Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga.[125] The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee. As 30 percent of Union Mini\u00e8re's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador John Winant hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and 1,720 long tons (1,750\u00a0t) of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.[126] To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in Uravan, Colorado. Uranium mining in Colorado yielded about 800 long tons (810\u00a0t) of ore.[127]\nMallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, took the raw ore and dissolved it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then added in a liquid\u2013liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide.[128] By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides.[129] Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This became known as the Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.[130]\nNatural uranium consists of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, but only the latter is fissile. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be physically separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for uranium enrichment, most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.[131]\nThe most obvious technology, the centrifuge, failed, but electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful and contributed to the project. In February 1943, Groves came up with the idea of using the output of some plants as the input for others.[132]\nThe centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942.[133] Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.[134]\nScaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2\u00a0lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with 1-meter (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with 4-meter (13\u00a0ft) rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting,[135] and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.[136] In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.[137]\nElectromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name was derived from the words California, university and cyclotron.[138] In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.[139] The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.[140] Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.[138]\nMarshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require 5,000 short tons (4,500 tonnes) of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with Under Secretary of the Treasury Daniel W. Bell and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository. \"Young man,\" Bell told him, \"you may think of silver in tons but the Treasury will always think of silver in troy ounces!\"[141] Eventually, 14,700 short tons (13,300 tonnes; 430,000,000 troy ounces) were used.[142]\nThe 1,000-troy-ounce (31\u00a0kg) silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets and taken to Phelps Dodge in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips 0.625 inches (15.9\u00a0mm) thick, 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) wide and 40 feet (12\u00a0m) long. These were wound onto magnetic coils by Allis-Chalmers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, only 1/3,600,000th was lost.[142][143] The last silver was returned in May 1970.[144]\nResponsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.[145]\nWhen the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.[140] The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.[146]\nTennessee Eastman was contracted to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed-fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack.[148] The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate. They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education. Nichols compared unit production data, and pointed out to Lawrence that the young \"hillbilly\" girl operators were outperforming his PhDs. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were \"trained like soldiers not to reason why\", while \"the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials.\"[149]\nY-12 initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.[150]\nThe most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen, and John R. Dunning.[151]\nIn November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant.[152] On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5\u00c2\u00a0million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents.[153] The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride would have to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.[154][155]\nKellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story 0.5-mile (0.80\u00a0km) long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the 500-acre (2.0\u00a0km2) site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, Union Carbide and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480\u00a0million.[156]\nThe production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.[157]\nThe thermal diffusion process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938.[158] It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.[159]\nThe Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when Captain William S. Parsons, the naval officer in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress in the Navy's experiments on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y-12. Groves set up a committee consisting of Warren K. Lewis, Eger Murphree and Richard Tolman to investigate the idea, and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $3.5\u00a0million could enrich 50 kilograms (110\u00a0lb) of uranium per week to nearly 0.9% uranium-235. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944.[160]\nGroves contracted with the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50. Groves's advisers, Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from Standard Oil,[161] estimated that it would take six months to build. Groves gave Ferguson just four. Plans called for the installation of 2,142 48-foot-tall (15\u00a0m) diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch (6,900\u00a0kPa) and temperature of 545\u00a0\u00b0F (285\u00a0\u00b0C), flowed downward through the innermost 1.25-inch (32\u00a0mm) nickel pipe, while water at 155\u00a0\u00b0F (68\u00a0\u00b0C) flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. Isotope separation occurred in the uranium hexafluoride gas between the nickel and copper pipes.[162]\nWork commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve. The plant produced just 10.5 pounds (4.8\u00a0kg) of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced 12,730 pounds (5,770\u00a0kg).[163] By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12,[164] which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons.[165]\nAbout 50 kilograms (110\u00a0lb) of uranium enriched to 89% uranium-235 was delivered to Los Alamos by July 1945.[165] The entire 50\u00a0kg, along with some 50%-enriched, averaging out to about 85% enriched, were used in Little Boy.[165]\nThe second line of development pursued by the Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239.[166] Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.[166]\nIn March 1943, DuPont began construction of a plutonium plant on a 112-acre (0.5\u00a0km2) site at Oak Ridge. Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor, a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot.[167] The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, 24 feet (7.3\u00a0m) long on each side, weighing around 1,500 long tons (1,500\u00a0t), surrounded by 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.[167]\nThe greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.[168]\nWatched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about 30 long tons (30\u00a0t) of uranium. A week later the load was increased to 36 long tons (37\u00a0t), raising its power generation to 500\u00a0kW, and by the end of the month the first 500 milligrams (0.018\u00a0oz) of plutonium was created.[169] Modifications over time raised the power to 4,000\u00a0kW in July 1944. X-10 operated as a production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities.[170]\nAlthough an air-cooled design was chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized that this would be impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build.[171] The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.[172]\nAs at Oak Ridge, the most difficulty was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.[173]\nWork began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250\u00a0MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.[174] The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites chosen to be developed first, as this maximised the distance between the reactors. They would be the only ones constructed during the Manhattan Project.[175] Some 390 long tons (400\u00a0t) of steel, 17,400 cubic yards (13,300\u00a0m3) of concrete, 50,000 concrete blocks and 71,000 concrete bricks were used to construct the 120-foot (37\u00a0m) high building.\nConstruction of the reactor itself commenced in February 1944.[176] Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.[177][178]\nFermi contacted Chien-Shiung Wu, who identified the cause of the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours.[179] Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, which turned out to be 30,000 times that of uranium.[180] Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.[181] Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.[182]\nMeanwhile, the chemists considered the problem of how plutonium could be separated from uranium when its chemical properties were not known. Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a lanthanum fluoride process for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the bismuth phosphate process, was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson.[183] This process worked by toggling plutonium between its +4 and +6 oxidation states in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.[184]\nGreenewalt favored the bismuth phosphate process due to the corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants.[185] Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%.[170]\nAt Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.[186]\nEarly plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East.[187] Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or \"canyon\" (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231) and a magazine store (213). The canyons were each 800 feet (240\u00a0m) long and 65 feet (20\u00a0m) wide. Each consisted of forty 17.7-by-13-by-20-foot (5.4 by 4.0 by 6.1\u00a0m) cells.[188]\nWork began on 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, with the former completed in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, all work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected by the end of the year.[189] On 5 February 1945, Matthias hand-delivered the first shipment of 80 grams (2.6\u00c2\u00a0ozt) of 95%-pure plutonium nitrate to a Los Alamos courier in Los Angeles.[182]\nIn 1943, development efforts were directed to a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segr\u00c3\u00a8 discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.[190] Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 that some of the plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.[191]\nThis made reactor plutonium unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a predetonation that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a fizzle). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.[192]\nWork on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier under the direction of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method.[193] Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design.[194] In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material.[195] He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.[196]\nBy July 1944, Oppenheimer had concluded plutonium could not be used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.[197] Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher.[198][199] The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.[200]\nThe design of lenses that detonated with the proper shape and velocity turned out to be slow, difficult and frustrating.[200] Various explosives were tested before settling on composition B as the fast explosive and baratol as the slow explosive.[201] The final design resembled a soccer ball, with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about 80 pounds (36\u00c2\u00a0kg). Getting the detonation just right required fast, reliable and safe electrical detonators, of which there were two for each lens for reliability.[202] It was therefore decided to use exploding-bridgewire detonators, a new invention developed at Los Alamos by a group led by Luis Alvarez. A contract for their manufacture was given to Raytheon.[203]\nTo study the behavior of converging shock waves, Robert Serber devised the RaLa Experiment, which used the short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation. The gamma ray source was placed in the center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an ionization chamber. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests.[204] In his history of the Los Alamos project, David Hawkins wrote: \"RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design\".[205]\nWithin the explosives was the 4.5-inch (110\u00a0mm) thick aluminum pusher, which provided a smooth transition from the relatively low density explosive to the next layer, the 3-inch (76\u00a0mm) thick tamper of natural uranium. Its main job was to hold the critical mass together as long as possible, but it would also reflect neutrons back into the core. Some part of it might fission as well. To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of boron.[202] A polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator, known as an \"urchin\" because its shape resembled a sea urchin,[206] was developed to start the chain reaction at precisely the right moment.[207] This work with the chemistry and metallurgy of radioactive polonium was directed by Charles Allen Thomas of the Monsanto Company and became known as the Dayton Project.[208] Testing required up to 500 curies per month of polonium, which Monsanto was able to deliver.[209] The whole assembly was encased in a duralumin bomb casing to protect it from bullets and flak.[202]\nThe ultimate task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium.[210] The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable \u03b4 phase that normally exists in the 300\u00a0\u00b0C to 450\u00a0\u00b0C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.[211]\nThe work proved dangerous. By the end of the war, half the experienced chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine.[212] A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site.[213] The hemispheres for the first plutonium pit (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.[214]\nBecause of the complexity of an implosion-style weapon, it was decided that, despite the waste of fissile material, an initial test would be required. Groves approved the test, subject to the active material being recovered. Consideration was therefore given to a controlled fizzle, but Oppenheimer opted instead for a full-scale nuclear test, codenamed \"Trinity\".[215]\nIn March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a professor of physics at Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge selected the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield as the site for the test.[216] Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive magazine and a commissary.[217]\nGroves did not relish the prospect of explaining the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed \"Jumbo\" was constructed to recover the active material in the event of a failure. Measuring 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m) long and 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) wide, it was fabricated at great expense from 214 long tons (217\u00a0t) of iron and steel by Babcock & Wilcox in Barberton, Ohio. Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last 25 miles (40\u00a0km) to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors.[218] By the time it arrived, however, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower 800 yards (730\u00a0m) from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.[219][220]\nA pre-test explosion was conducted on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments. A wooden test platform was erected 800 yards (730\u00a0m) from Ground Zero and piled with 100 long tons (100\u00a0t) of TNT spiked with nuclear fission products in the form of an irradiated uranium slug from Hanford, which was dissolved and poured into tubing inside the explosive. This explosion was observed by Oppenheimer and Groves's new deputy commander, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell. The pre-test produced data that proved vital for the Trinity test.[220][221]\nFor the actual test, the weapon, nicknamed \"the gadget\", was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot (30\u00a0m) steel tower, as detonation at that height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber. Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target, and generated less nuclear fallout. The gadget was assembled under the supervision of Norris Bradbury at the nearby McDonald Ranch House on 13 July, and precariously winched up the tower the following day.[222] Observers included Bush, Chadwick, Conant, Farrell, Fermi, Groves, Lawrence, Oppenheimer and Tolman. At 05:30 on 16 July 1945 the gadget exploded with an energy equivalent of around 20 kilotons of TNT, leaving a crater of Trinitite (radioactive glass) in the desert 250 feet (76\u00a0m) wide. The shock wave was felt over 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away, and the mushroom cloud reached 7.5 miles (12.1\u00a0km) in height. It was heard as far away as El Paso, Texas, so Groves issued a cover story about an ammunition magazine explosion at Alamogordo Field.[223][224]\nIn June 1944, the Manhattan Project employed some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant operators and 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, but the number of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult.[225] In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.[226]\nTolman and Conant, in their role as the project's scientific advisers, drew up a list of candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work.[227] At the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project.[228] Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.[229]\nOne source of skilled personnel was the Army itself, particularly the Army Specialized Training Program. In 1943, the MED created the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), with an authorized strength of 675. Technicians and skilled workers drafted into the Army were assigned to the SED. Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well.[230] On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.[231]\nAn Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos.[232] The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials.[233] Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.[234]\nA 1945 Life article estimated that before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings \"probably no more than a few dozen men in the entire country knew the full meaning of the Manhattan Project, and perhaps only a thousand others even were aware that work on atoms was involved.\" The magazine wrote that the more than 100,000 others employed with the project \"worked like moles in the dark\". Warned that disclosing the project's secrets was punishable by 10 years in prison or a $10,000 ($108,000 today[1]) fine, they saw enormous quantities of raw materials enter factories with nothing coming out, and monitored \"dials and switches while behind thick concrete walls mysterious reactions took place\" without knowing the purpose of their jobs.[235][236][237][238][239]\nOak Ridge security personnel considered any private party with more than seven people as suspicious, and residents\u2014who believed that US government agents were secretly among them\u2014avoided repeatedly inviting the same guests. Although original residents of the area could be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection.[239] Everyone, including top military officials, and their automobiles were searched when entering and exiting project facilities. One Oak Ridge worker stated that \"if you got inquisitive, you were called on the carpet within two hours by government secret agents. Usually those summoned to explain were then escorted bag and baggage to the gate and ordered to keep going.\" Nonetheless, despite being told that their work would help end the war and perhaps all future wars,[240] not seeing or understanding the results of their often tedious duties\u2014or even typical side effects of factory work such as smoke from smokestacks\u2014and the war in Europe ending without the use of their work, caused serious morale problems among workers and caused many rumors to spread. One manager stated after the war:\nWell it wasn't that the job was tough\u00c2\u00a0... it was confusing. You see, no one knew what was being made in Oak Ridge, not even me, and a lot of the people thought they were wasting their time here. It was up to me to explain to the dissatisfied workers that they were doing a very important job. When they asked me what, I'd have to tell them it was a secret. But I almost went crazy myself trying to figure out what was going on.[238]\nAnother worker told of how, working in a laundry, she every day held \"a special instrument\" to uniforms and listened for \"a clicking noise\". She learned only after the war that she had been performing the important task of checking for radiation with a geiger counter. To improve morale among such workers Oak Ridge created an extensive system of intramural sports leagues, including 10 baseball teams, 81 softball teams, and 26 football teams.[238]\nVoluntary censorship of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After the start of the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the National Academy of Sciences to clear articles. William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post in September 1940 on atomic fission, later learned that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue.[241] The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist Georgy Flyorov wrote to Josef Stalin on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.[242]\nThe Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project.[243] The government's Office of Censorship, by contrast, relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office. By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington based on public records, and the office began discussing with the project how to maintain secrecy. In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing \"atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons.\" The office also asked to avoid discussion of \"polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium\"; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.[244][245]\nThe prospect of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected when there were equipment failures. While there were some problems believed to be the result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage.[246] However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down.[247] With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues.[248] By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Soviet Union.[249]\nThe most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, a member of the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos.[250] The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada.[251] Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.[252] Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades.[253] The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.[254]\nIn addition to developing the atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project was charged with gathering intelligence on the German nuclear energy project. It was believed that the Japanese nuclear weapons program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, but it was initially feared that Germany was very close to developing its own weapons. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, a bombing and sabotage campaign was carried out against heavy water plants in German-occupied Norway.[255] A small mission was created, jointly staffed by the Office of Naval Intelligence, OSRD, the Manhattan Project, and Army Intelligence (G-2), to investigate enemy scientific developments. It was not restricted to those involving nuclear weapons.[256] The Chief of Army Intelligence, Major General George V. Strong, appointed Boris Pash to command the unit,[257] which was codenamed \"Alsos\", a Greek word meaning \"grove\".[258]\nThe Alsos Mission to Italy questioned staff of the physics laboratory at the University of Rome following the capture of the city in June 1944.[259] Meanwhile, Pash formed a combined British and American Alsos mission in London under the command of Captain Horace K. Calvert to participate in Operation Overlord.[260] Groves considered the risk that the Germans might attempt to disrupt the Normandy landings with radioactive poisons was sufficient to warn General Dwight D. Eisenhower and send an officer to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith.[261] Under the codename Operation Peppermint, special equipment was prepared and Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use.[262]\nFollowing in the wake of the advancing Allied armies, Pash and Calvert interviewed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie about the activities of German scientists. They spoke to officials at Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga about uranium shipments to Germany. They tracked down 68 tons of ore in Belgium and 30 tons in France. The interrogation of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in Oranienburg, 20 miles north of Berlin, so Groves arranged for it to be bombed on 15 March 1945.[263]\nAn Alsos team went to Stassfurt in the Soviet Occupation Zone and retrieved 11 tons of ore from WIFO.[264] In April 1945, Pash, in command of a composite force known as T-Force, conducted Operation Harborage, a sweep behind enemy lines of the cities of Hechingen, Bisingen, and Haigerloch that were the heart of the German nuclear effort. T-Force captured the nuclear laboratories, documents, equipment and supplies, including heavy water and 1.5 tons of metallic uranium.[265][266]\nAlsos teams rounded up German scientists including Kurt Diebner, Otto Hahn, Walther Gerlach, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker, who were taken to England where they were interned at Farm Hall, a bugged house in Godmanchester. After the bombs were detonated in Japan, the Germans were forced to confront the fact that the Allies had done what they could not.[267]\nStarting in November 1943, the Army Air Forces Materiel Command at Wright Field, Ohio, began Silverplate, the codename modification of B-29s to carry the bombs. Test drops were carried out at Muroc Army Air Field, California, and the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California.[268] Groves met with the Chief of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General Henry H. Arnold, in March 1944 to discuss the delivery of the finished bombs to their targets.[269] The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the 17-foot (5.2\u00a0m) long Thin Man or the 59-inch (150\u00a0cm) wide Fat Man was the British Avro Lancaster, but using a British aircraft would have caused difficulties with maintenance. Groves hoped that the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress could be modified to carry Thin Man by joining its two bomb bays together.[270] Arnold promised that no effort would be spared to modify B-29s to do the job, and designated Major General Oliver P. Echols as the USAAF liaison to the Manhattan Project. In turn, Echols named Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as his alternate, and Wilson became Manhattan Project's main USAAF contact.[269] President Roosevelt instructed Groves that if the atomic bombs were ready before the war with Germany ended, he should be ready to drop them on Germany.[271]\nThe 509th Composite Group was activated on 17 December 1944 at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, under the command of Colonel Paul W. Tibbets. This base, close to the border with Nevada, was codenamed \"Kingman\" or \"W-47\". Training was conducted at Wendover and at Batista Army Airfield, Cuba, where the 393d Bombardment Squadron practiced long-distance flights over water, and dropping dummy pumpkin bombs. A special unit known as Project Alberta was formed at Los Alamos under Navy Captain William S. Parsons from Project Y as part of the Manhattan Project to assist in preparing and delivering the bombs.[272] Commander Frederick L. Ashworth from Alberta met with Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz on Guam in February 1945 to inform him of the project. While he was there, Ashworth selected North Field on the Pacific Island Tinian as a base for the 509th Composite Group, and reserved space for the group and its buildings. The group deployed there in July 1945.[273] Farrell arrived at Tinian on 30 July as the Manhattan Project representative.[274]\nMost of the components for Little Boy left San Francisco on the cruiser USS\u00c2\u00a0Indianapolis on 16 July and arrived on Tinian on 26 July. Four days later the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine. The remaining components, which included six uranium-235 rings, were delivered by three C-54 Skymasters of the 509th Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron.[275] Two Fat Man assemblies travelled to Tinian in specially modified 509th Composite Group B-29s. The first plutonium core went in a special C-54.[276] A joint targeting committee of the Manhattan District and USAAF was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets, and recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata, and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would be making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto on the grounds of its historical and religious significance. Groves therefore asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well.[277] One of Kyoto's substitutes was Nagasaki.[278]\nIn May 1945, the Interim Committee was created to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The committee was chaired by Stimson, with James F. Byrnes, a former US Senator soon to be Secretary of State, as President Harry S. Truman's personal representative; Ralph A. Bard, the Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of New York Life Insurance Company. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.[279]\nAt the Potsdam Conference in Germany, Truman was informed that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details. This was the first official communication to the Soviet Union about the bomb, but Stalin already knew about it from spies.[280] With the authorization to use the bomb against Japan already given, no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the Potsdam Declaration.[281]\nOn 6 August 1945, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress (Enola Gay) of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, piloted by Tibbets, lifted off from North Field, and Little Boy in its bomb bay. Hiroshima, the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division and a port of embarkation, was the primary target of the mission, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternatives. With Farrell's permission, Parsons, the weaponeer in charge of the mission, completed the bomb assembly in the air to minimize the risks during takeoff.[282] The bomb detonated at an altitude of 1,750 feet (530\u00a0m) with a blast that was later estimated to be the equivalent of 13 kilotons of TNT.[283] An area of approximately 4.7 square miles (12\u00a0km2) was destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6\u20137% damaged. About 70,000 to 80,000 people, of whom 20,000 were Japanese combatants and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, or some 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed immediately, and another 70,000 injured.[284][285][286]\nOn the morning of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200\u201328,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.[287] Overall, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.[288][289]\nGroves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October.[290] Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August.[289] At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core.[291] Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August.[292] It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority.[293] Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.[293]\nOn 11 August, Groves phoned Warren with orders to organize a survey team to report on the damage and radioactivity at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A party equipped with portable Geiger counters arrived in Hiroshima on 8 September headed by Farrell and Warren, with Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October.[294] This and other scientific missions to Japan would provide valuable scientific and historical data.[295]\nThe necessity of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki became a subject of controversy among historians. Some questioned whether an \"atomic diplomacy\" would not have attained the same goals and disputed whether the bombings or the Soviet declaration of war on Japan was decisive.[296] The Franck Report was the most notable effort pushing for a demonstration but was turned down by the Interim Committee's scientific panel.[297] The Szil\u00e1rd petition, drafted in July 1945 and signed by dozens of scientists working on the Manhattan Project, was a late attempt at warning President Harry S. Truman about his responsibility in using such weapons.[298][299]\nSeeing the work they had not understood produce the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs amazed the workers of the Manhattan Project as much as the rest of the world; newspapers in Oak Ridge announcing the Hiroshima bomb sold for $1 ($11 today[1]).[236][245] Although the bombs' existence was public, secrecy continued, and many workers remained ignorant of their jobs; one stated in 1946, \"I don't know what the hell I'm doing besides looking into a \u2014\u2014\u2014 and turning a \u2014\u2014\u2014 alongside a \u2014\u2014\u2014. I don't know anything about it, and there's nothing to say\". Many residents continued to avoid discussion of \"the stuff\" in ordinary conversation despite it being the reason for their town's existence.[239]\nIn anticipation of the bombings, Groves had Henry DeWolf Smyth prepare a history for public consumption. Atomic Energy for Military Purposes, better known as the \"Smyth Report\", was released to the public on 12 August 1945.[300] Groves and Nichols presented Army\u2013Navy \"E\" Awards to key contractors, whose involvement had hitherto been secret. Over 20 awards of the Presidential Medal for Merit were made to key contractors and scientists, including Bush and Oppenheimer. Military personnel received the Legion of Merit, including the commander of the Women's Army Corps detachment, Captain Arlene G. Scheidenhelm.[301]\nAt Hanford, plutonium production fell off as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and swelling of the graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In order to maintain the supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.[302]\nBomb engineering was carried out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from Los Alamos. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of Sandia Base. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests.[303] By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia.[304] As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty hand-picked regular officers.[305]\nNichols recommended that S-50 and the Alpha tracks at Y-12 be closed down. This was done in September.[306] Although performing better than ever,[307] the Alpha tracks could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2\u00c2\u00a0million a month.[308]\nNowhere was demobilization more of a problem than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much remained to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty about the future of the laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years.[304] Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.[302]\nTwo Fat Man\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctype detonations were conducted at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 as part of Operation Crossroads to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships.[309] Able was detonated on 1 July 1946. The more spectacular Baker was detonated underwater on 25 July 1946.[310]\nAfter the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a number of Manhattan Project physicists founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons.[311] In the face of the destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled in a speech to the newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.[312]\nFollowing a domestic debate over the permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP).[313] Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District was not abolished until 15 August 1947.[314]\nThe project expenditure through 1 October 1945 was $1.845\u00a0billion, equivalent to less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191\u00a0billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4\u00a0billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.[316][317]\nA total of four weapons (the Trinity gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused bomb) were produced by the end of 1945, making the average cost per bomb around $500\u00c2\u00a0million in 1945 dollars. By comparison, the project's total cost by the end of 1945 was about 90% of the total spent on the production of US small arms (not including ammunition) and 34% of the total spent on US tanks during the same period.[315]\nThe political and cultural impacts of the development of nuclear weapons were profound and far-reaching. William Laurence of the New York Times, the first to use the phrase \"Atomic Age\",[318] became the official correspondent for the Manhattan Project in spring 1945. In 1943 and 1944 he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Office of Censorship to permit writing about the explosive potential of uranium, and government officials felt that he had earned the right to report on the biggest secret of the war. Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test[319] and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the official press releases prepared for them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and motivated its development in the United States and the Soviet Union.[320]\nThe wartime Manhattan Project left a legacy in the form of the network of national laboratories: the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Ames Laboratory. Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York, and the Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72\u00a0million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946\u20131947.[325] They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that Alvin Weinberg, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call Big Science.[326]\nThe Naval Research Laboratory had long been interested in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now Chief of Naval Operations, decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain Hyman G. Rickover, who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a nuclear-powered navy.[327] A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing nuclear aircraft.[328] Their Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately cancelled.[329]\nThe ability of the new reactors to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in nuclear medicine in the immediate postwar years. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities. Most of the orders were for iodine-131 and phosphorus-32, which were used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In addition to medicine, isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.[330]\nOn handing over control to the Atomic Energy Commission, Groves bid farewell to the people who had worked on the Manhattan Project:\nFive years ago, the idea of Atomic Power was only a dream. You have made that dream a reality. You have seized upon the most nebulous of ideas and translated them into actualities. You have built cities where none were known before. You have constructed industrial plants of a magnitude and to a precision heretofore deemed impossible. You built the weapon which ended the War and thereby saved countless American lives. With regard to peacetime applications, you have raised the curtain on vistas of a new world.[331]\nIn 2014, the United States Congress passed a law providing for a national park dedicated to the history of the Manhattan Project.[332] The Manhattan Project National Historical Park was established on 10 November 2015.[333]",

This arrangement will prevent any contaminants in the sink from flowing into the potable water system by siphonage and is the least expensive form of backflow prevention.\nA common use of the term \"air gap\" in home plumbing refers to a fixture that provides back-flow prevention for an installed dishwasher. This \"air gap\" is seen above the countertop as a small cylindrical fixture mounted parallel with the faucet. Below the countertop, the drain pipe of the dishwasher feeds the \"top\" of the air gap, and the \"bottom\" of the air gap is plumbed into the sink drain below the basket, or into a garbage disposal unit. When installed and maintained properly, the air gap works as described above, and prevents drain water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher, possibly contaminating dishes.[2] Water flowing from the fixture into the sink indicates a need for maintenance or repair.[3]\nTo further illustrate the air gap, consider what could happen if the air gap were eliminated by attaching a hose to the faucet and lowering the hose into a sink full of contaminated water. Under the right conditions (if the water supply loses pressure and the sink is higher than the point at which the water supply enters the house, for instance), the dirty water in the sink will be siphoned into the water pipes through the hose and faucet. The dirty water then will be dispersed throughout the drinking water system.\nAll plumbing codes require backflow prevention in several ways. The plumbing fixture manufacturers build the fixtures to meet these codes. Plumbers must not build cross-connections in their daily work practices, and plumbing inspectors look for improper designs or connections of piping and plumbing fixtures. A common misconception[citation needed] is that a \"high loop\" (routing a drain line above a sink's flood level, for instance) will provide the same function as an air gap; this is not true, because the continuous connection in such a case still will allow backflow through siphoning.\nAccording to the International Residential Code 2003, an air gap must meet the requirements of being two times the effective inner diameter of the pipe (2*D) in order to be sufficient.[4]\nA standard widely use in the United States is:",

        "text": "Liberal arts education (Latin: liberalis, free and ars, art or principled practice) can claim to be the oldest programme of higher education in Western history. It has its origin in the attempt to discover first principles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 'those universal principles which are the condition of the possibility of the existence of anything and everything'.[1] The liberal arts are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person (Latin: liberalis, \"worthy of a free person\")[2] to know in order to take an active part in civic life, something that (for Ancient Greece) included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were the core liberal arts (the Trivium), while arithmetic, geometry, the theory of music, and astronomy also played a (somewhat lesser) part in education (as the Quadrivium).[3]\nLiberal arts education can refer to academic subjects such as literature, philosophy, mathematics, and social and physical sciences,[4] or it can also refer to overall studies in a liberal arts degree program. For both interpretations, the term generally refers to matters not relating to the professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.\nRooted in the basic curriculum \u2013 the enkuklios paideia or \"education in a circle\" \u2013 of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece, the \"liberal arts\" or \"liberal pursuits\" (Latin liberalia studia) were already so called in formal education during the Roman Empire. The first recorded use of the term \"liberal arts\" (artes liberales) occurs in De Inventione by Marcus Tullius Cicero, but it is unclear if he created the term.[5][6] Seneca the Younger discusses liberal arts in education from a critical Stoic point of view in Moral Epistle 88.[7] The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times,[8] and it was only after Martianus Capella in the 5th century AD influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the Marriage of Mercury and Philology,[9] that they took on canonical form.\nThe four 'scientific' artes \u2013 music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy (or astrology) \u2013 were known from the time of Boethius onwards as the Quadrivium. After the 9th century, the remaining three arts of the 'humanities' \u2013 grammar, logic, and rhetoric \u2013 were classed as well, as the Trivium.[8] It was in that two-fold form that the seven liberal arts were studied in the medieval Western university.[10][11] During the Middle Ages, logic gradually came to take predominance over the other parts of the Trivium.[12]\nIn the Renaissance, the Italian humanists and their Northern counterparts, despite in many respects continuing the traditions of the Middle Ages, reversed that process.[13] Re-christening the old Trivium with a new and more ambitious name: Studia humanitatis, and also increasing its scope, they downplayed logic as opposed to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric, and added to them history, Greek, and moral philosophy (ethics), with a new emphasis on poetry as well.[14] The educational curriculum of humanism spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine.[15] The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in classical languages and literature, persisted until the middle of the twentieth century.[16]\nSome subsections of the liberal arts are in the trivium\u2014the verbal arts: grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and in the quadrivium\u2014the numerical arts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Analyzing and interpreting information is also included.\nAcademic areas that are associated with the term liberal arts include:\nFor example, the core courses for Georgetown University's Doctor of Liberal Studies program[17] cover philosophy, theology, history, art, literature, and the social sciences. Wesleyan University's Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program includes courses in visual arts, art history, creative and professional writing, literature, history, mathematics, film, government, education, biology, psychology, and astronomy.[18]\nThe liberal arts education at the secondary school level prepares the student for higher education at a university. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a liberal arts education often study Latin and Ancient Greek.\nSome liberal arts education provide general education, others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The four traditional branches are:\nCurricula differ from school to school, but generally include language, mathematics, informatics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, art (as well as crafts and design), music, history, philosophy, civics / citizenship,[19] social sciences, and several foreign languages.\nSchools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the German constitution guarantees the separation of church and state, so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.\nToday, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as gymnasiums specializing in economics, technology or domestic sciences. In some countries, there is a notion of progymnasium, which is equivalent to beginning classes of the full gymnasium, with the rights to continue education in a gymnasium. Here, the prefix \"pro\" is equivalent to \"pre\".\nIn the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts.[20] The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often Socratic, typically with small classes, and often has a lower student-to-teacher ratio than at large universities; professors teaching classes are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than primary research professors or graduate student teaching assistants in universities.[citation needed]\nIn addition, most four-year colleges that are not devoted exclusively or primarily to liberal arts degrees also offer those degrees, and students not majoring in liberal arts take courses to satisfy distribution requirements in liberal arts.\nTraditionally, a bachelor's degree either in liberal arts in general or in one particular area within liberal arts, with substantial study outside that main area, is earned over four years of full-time study. However, some universities such as Saint Leo University,[21] Pennsylvania State University,[22] Florida Institute of Technology[23] and New England College[24] have begun to offer an associate degree in liberal arts. Colleges like New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho, offer a unique program with only one degree offering, a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, and colleges like the University of Oklahoma College of Liberal Studies offers an online, part-time option for adult and nontraditional students.\nMost students earn either a Bachelor of Arts degree or a Bachelor of Science[25] degree; on completing undergraduate study, students might progress to either a liberal arts graduate school or a professional school (public administration, engineering, business, law, medicine, theology).\nIn most parts of Europe, liberal arts education is deeply rooted. In Germany, Austria and countries influenced by their education system, e.g. it is called \"humanistische Bildung\" (humanistic education). The term is not to be mixed up with some modern educational concepts that use a similar wording. Educational institutions that see themselves in that tradition are often a \"Gymnasium\" (high school, grammar school). They aim at providing their pupils with comprehensive education (Bildung) in order to form personality with regard to a pupil's own humanity as well as his/her innate intellectual skills.[citation needed] Going back to the long tradition of the liberal arts in Europe, education in the above sense was freed from scholastic thinking and re-shaped by the theorists of enlightenment. In particular, Wilhelm von Humboldt played a key role in that regard. Since students are considered to have received a comprehensive liberal arts education at grammar schools, very often, the role of liberal arts education in undergraduate education at universities is reduced compared to the US educational system.[citation needed] Students are expected to use their skills received at the grammar school in order to further develop their personality in their own responsibility, e.g. in universities' music clubs, theatre groups, language clubs etc. Universities encourage students to do so and offer respective opportunities but do not make such activities part of the university's curriculum.[citation needed]\nThus, on the level of higher education, despite the European origin of the liberal arts college,[26] the term liberal arts college usually denotes liberal arts colleges in the United States.[citation needed] With the exception of pioneering institutions such as Franklin University Switzerland (formerly known as Franklin College), established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969,[27] only recently some efforts have been undertaken to systematically \"re-import\" liberal arts education to continental Europe, as with Leiden University College The Hague, University College Utrecht, University College Maastricht, Amsterdam University College, Roosevelt Academy (now University College Roosevelt), ATLAS University College, Erasmus University College, University College Groningen, Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts, and Bard College Berlin, formerly known as the European College of Liberal Arts. As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences (Tilburg University). Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does St. Marys University College Belfast, both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology university college since the late 1990s. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students.[28] The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011,[29] followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University's Campus Gotland in the autumn of 2013.[30] The first Liberal Arts program in Georgia was introduced in 2005 by American-Georgian Initiative for Liberal Education (AGILE),[31] an NGO. In collaboration with AGILE, Ilia State University[32] became the first higher education institution in Georgia to establish a liberal arts program.[33]\nIn France, Chavagnes Studium, a Liberal Arts Study Centre in partnership with the Institut Catholique d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures, and based in a former Catholic seminary, is launching a two-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts, with a distinctively Catholic outlook.[34] It has been suggested that the liberal arts degree may become part of mainstream education provision in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In 1999, the European College of Liberal Arts (now Bard College Berlin) was founded in Berlin[35] and in 2009 it introduced a four-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English,[36] leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities.\nIn England, the first institution[37] to retrieve and update a liberal arts education at undergraduate level was The University of Winchester with their BA (Hons) Modern Liberal Arts programme which launched in 2010.[37] In 2012, University College London began its interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences BASc degree (which has kinship with the liberal arts model) with 80 students.[38] King's College London launched the BA Liberal Arts, which has a slant towards arts, humanities and social sciences subjects.[39] The New College of the Humanities also launched a new liberal education programme. The University of Nottingham has a Liberal Arts BA that provides an interdisciplinary approach, study abroad options and links with its Natural Sciences degrees.[40] In 2016, the University of Warwick launched a three/four-year liberal arts BA degree, which focuses on transdisciplinary approaches and Problem-based learning techniques in addition to providing structured disciplinary pathways.[41] And for 2017 entry UCAS lists 20 providers of liberal arts programmes.[42]\nIn Scotland, the four-year undergraduate Honours degree, specifically the Master of Arts, has historically demonstrated considerable breadth in focus. In the first two years of Scottish MA and BA degrees students typically study a number of different subjects before specialising in their Honours years (third and fourth year). The University of Dundee and the University of Glasgow (at its Crichton Campus) are the only Scottish universities that currently offer a specifically named 'Liberal Arts' degree.\nThe Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines mandates a General Education curriculum required of all higher education institutions; it includes a number of liberal arts subjects, including history, art appreciation, and ethics, plus interdisciplinary electives. Many universities have much more robust liberal arts core curricula; most notably, the Jesuit universities such as Ateneo de Manila University have a strong liberal arts core curriculum that includes philosophy, theology, literature, history, and the social sciences. Forman Christian College (A Chartered University) is a liberal arts education institution in Lahore, Pakistan. It is one of the oldest institutions in Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. It is a chartered university recognized by Higher Education Commission Pakistan. Habib University in Karachi, Pakistan offers a holistic liberal arts and sciences experience to its students through its uniquely tailored liberal core program which is compulsory for all undergraduate degree students.[43][44] The Underwood International College of Yonsei University, Korea, has compulsory liberal arts course for all the student body. Symbiosis & FLAME University in Pune, Ahmedabad University, Ashoka University, Lingnan University and University of Liberal Arts- Bangladesh (ULAB) are also a few such liberal arts colleges in Asia. International Christian University in Tokyo is the first and one of the very few liberal arts universities in Japan.\nCampion College is a Roman Catholic dedicated liberal arts college, located in the western suburbs of Sydney. Founded in 2006, it is the first tertiary educational liberal arts college of its type in Australia. Campion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines studied are history, literature, philosophy, and theology.",

It was Valli's biggest solo hit until he hit #1 in 1974 with \"My Eyes Adored You\".[3]\n\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" has had hundreds of cover versions, many of which have been on the charts in different countries. The song is a staple of television and film soundtracks, even being featured as part of the plot of some films, such as when the lead characters sing or arrange their own version of the song. Its chorus has also become a popular football chant, with supporters of various teams inserting their club's name or a popular player's name into the beat (for instance, A.S.

        "text": "Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2015 American erotic romantic drama film directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, with a screenplay by Kelly Marcel. The film is based on the 2011 novel of the same name by British author E. L. James and stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, a college graduate who begins a sadomasochistic relationship with young business magnate Christian Grey, played by Jamie Dornan.\nThe film premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 2015 and was released on February 13, 2015, by Universal Pictures and Focus Features.[4][5] Despite receiving generally negative reviews, it was an immediate box office success, breaking numerous box office records and earning over $571 million worldwide.\nThe film was the most awarded at the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards, winning five of six nominations, including Worst Picture (tied with Fantastic Four) and both leading roles. In contrast, Ellie Goulding's single \"Love Me like You Do\" was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, while The Weeknd's single \"Earned It\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\nIt is the first film in the Fifty Shades film series and was followed by two sequels, Fifty Shades Darker (2017) and Fifty Shades Freed (2018).\nTwenty-one-year-old Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is an English literature major at Washington State University's (\"WSU\") satellite campus near Vancouver, Washington. When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to go in her place. At Christian's Seattle headquarters called Grey House, Ana stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU commencement speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works. He agrees to Ana's request for a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Ana had interviewed him.\nChristian invites Ana for coffee, but he leaves abruptly, saying he is not the man for her. Christian later sends Ana first edition copies of two Thomas Hardy novels, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles, as a gift.\nAna and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, Ana spontaneously calls Christian, saying she is returning the books and berates his behavior towards her. Christian goes to the bar and finds Ana, who passes out. She wakes up the next morning in Christian's hotel room, relieved that they were not intimate.\nAna and Christian begin seeing each other, though he insists that she sign a non-disclosure agreement preventing her from revealing details about their dalliance. Christian explains that he only has interrelations involving bondage that is clearly defined in a signed contract. Ana reveals that she is a virgin. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after visiting his \"playroom\", a room stocked with a variety of BDSM toys, furniture, and gear, she and Christian have sex.\nChristian bestows Ana with gifts and favors, such as a new car and laptop computer. After Ana and Kate move to Seattle, Ana continues seeing Christian. During dinner at Christian's parents, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in Georgia. Later, Christian becomes frustrated when Ana expresses she wants more than the one-sided relationship he proposes. She is shocked when Christian unexpectedly arrives in Georgia, they have sex again but he leaves soon afterward, to tend to an emergency in Seattle.\nAfter returning home, Ana continues seeing Christian, who wants further sexual experimentation. Ana initially consents, but Christian keeps emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian psychologically, Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule breaking. Christian whips Ana's buttocks six times with a belt. Upset and disgusted, Ana breaks up with Christian after concluding that he is wrong for her and his practices border on being deviant and excessive.\nIn an alternative ending, both Ana and Christian experience flashbacks. Christian jogs in the rain, while Ana sobs in her apartment. Christian encounters a gift Ana gave him with the note: \"This reminded me of a happy time. \u00e2\u20ac\u201dAna\".[6]\nBy early 2013, several Hollywood studios were keen to obtain film rights to The New York Times bestselling Fifty Shades trilogy of novels.[17] Warner Bros., Sony, Paramount, Universal, and Mark Wahlberg's production company submitted bids for the film rights.[18][19] Universal Pictures and Focus Features secured the rights to the trilogy in March 2013.[5] Author James sought to retain some control during the movie's creative process.[20] James chose The Social Network producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti to produce the film.[4][21]\nAlthough American Psycho writer Bret Easton Ellis publicly expressed his desire to write the screenplay for Fifty Shades of Grey,[22] Kelly Marcel, screenwriter of Saving Mr. Banks, was hired for the job.[23] Patrick Marber was brought in by Taylor-Wood to polish the screenplay, specifically to do some \"character work\".[24] Universal hired Mark Bomback for script doctoring.[25] Mark Bridges served as the costume designer.[26] Entertainment Weekly estimated the film's budget as \"$40 million-or-so\".[27]\nBy May 9, 2013, the studio was considering Joe Wright to direct,[28] but this proved unworkable due to Wright's schedule.[29] Other directors who had been under consideration included Patty Jenkins, Bill Condon, Bennett Miller, and Steven Soderbergh.[30] In June 2013, E. L. James announced Sam Taylor-Johnson would direct the film adaptation.[31] Johnson was paid over $2 million for directing the film.[32]\n9\u00bd Weeks, Last Tango in Paris, and Blue Is the Warmest Colour were all cited by Taylor-Johnson as inspirations for the film.[33]\nBret Easton Ellis stated that Robert Pattinson had been James's first choice for the role of Christian Grey,[34] but James felt that casting Pattinson and his Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart in the film would be \"weird\".[35] Ian Somerhalder and Chace Crawford both expressed interest in the role of Christian.[36][37] Somerhalder later admitted if he had been considered, the filming process would ultimately have conflicted with his shooting schedule for The CW's series The Vampire Diaries.[38] On September 2, 2013, James revealed that Charlie Hunnam and Dakota Johnson had been cast as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, respectively.[39] The short list of other actresses considered for the role of Anastasia included Alicia Vikander, Imogen Poots, Elizabeth Olsen, Shailene Woodley, and Felicity Jones.[40] Keeley Hazell auditioned for an unspecified role.[41] Lucy Hale also auditioned for the film.[42] Emilia Clarke was also offered the role of Anastasia but turned down the part because of the nudity required.[43] Taylor-Johnson would give every actress who auditioned for the role of Anastasia four pages to read of a monologue from Ingmar Bergman's Persona.[33]\nThe studio originally wanted Ryan Gosling for Christian, but he was not interested in the role.[40] Garrett Hedlund was also considered, but he could not connect with the character.[40] Stephen Amell said he would not have wanted to play the role of Grey because \"I actually didn't find him to be that interesting ... nothing about Christian Grey really spoke to me.\"[44] Hunnam initially turned down the role of Christian but later reconsidered it, following a meeting with studio heads.[45] Hunnam said of the audition process: \"I felt really intrigued and excited about it so I went and read the first book to get a clearer idea of who this character was, and I felt even more excited at the prospect of bringing him to life. We [Taylor-Johnson and I] kind of both suggested I do a reading with Dakota, who was her favorite, and as soon as we got in the room and I started reading with Dakota I knew that I definitely wanted to do it. There's just like a tangible chemistry between us. It felt exciting and fun and weird and compelling.\"[46] In response to the negative fan reaction the casting drew, producer Dana Brunetti said: \"There is a lot that goes into casting that isn't just looks. Talent, availability, their desire to do it, chemistry with other actor, etc. So if your favorite wasn't cast, then it is most likely due to something on that list. Keep that in mind while hating and keep perspective.\"[47]\nDuring October 2013, actress Jennifer Ehle was in talks for the role of Anastasia's mother Carla.[8] On October 12, 2013, Universal Pictures announced that Hunnam had exited the film due to conflicts with the schedule of his FX series Sons of Anarchy.[48] Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Jamie Dornan, Theo James, Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud, Scott Eastwood, Luke Bracey, and Billy Magnussen were at the top of the list to replace Hunnam as Christian Grey.[49][50] Finally, on October 23, 2013, Dornan was cast as Christian Grey.[51] On October 31, 2013, Victor Rasuk was cast as Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez, Jr.[10] On November 22, 2013, Eloise Mumford was cast as Kate Kavanagh.[7] On December 2, 2013, singer Rita Ora was cast as Christian's younger sister Mia.[52] Ora originally wanted to work on the soundtrack.[53] On December 3, 2013, Marcia Gay Harden was cast as Christian's mother, Grace.[9]\nIn September, filming was scheduled to start on November 5, 2013, in Vancouver, British Columbia.[54] The following month, producer Michael De Luca announced filming would begin on November 13, 2013.[55]\nPrincipal photography was again delayed and eventually started on December 1, 2013.[56] Scenes were filmed in the Gastown district of Vancouver.[57] Bentall 5 was used as the Grey Enterprises building.[58][59]\nThe University of British Columbia serves as Washington State University Vancouver, from which Ana graduates.[60] The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver was used as the Heathman Hotel.[61][62]\nThe film was also shot at the North Shore Studios.[63] The production officially ended on February 21, 2014.[64] Reshoots involving scenes between Dornan and Johnson took place in Vancouver during the week of October 13, 2014.[65] The film was shot under the working title \"The Adventures of Max and Banks.\"[66]\nJames said that the film's soundtrack would be released on February 10, 2015.[67][68] The first single, \"Earned It\", by The Weeknd, was released on December 24, 2014.[69] On January 7, 2015, the second single, \"Love Me like You Do\" by Ellie Goulding was released, later reaching the top three on the Billboard Hot 100, and becoming a hit for the soundtrack.[70] A promotional single, \"Salted Wound\" by Australian recording artist Sia, was released on January 27, 2015.[71] To date, the soundtrack has sold 516,000 copies in the United States.[72]\nIn February 2013, Universal chairman Adam Fogelson said the film \"could be ready to release ... as early as next summer.\"[73] The studio initially announced an August 1, 2014, release.[74] However, in November 2013, it was pushed back to February 13, 2015, in time for Valentine's Day.[75] Fifty Shades of Grey was first screened at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 2015.[76] The film was released in 75 IMAX screens across the US on February 13, 2015.[77][78]\nOn January 25, 2014, more than a year prior to release, Universal displayed posters with the phrase, \"Mr. Grey will see you now\", in five locations across the United States.[79] On February 14, 2014, the first photograph of Johnson as Anastasia was released.[80] On June 18, 2014, the film's official Twitter account released the first still of Dornan as Christian in honor of Christian's birthday.[81]\nOn July 9, 2014, the book's author, E. L. James, said on Twitter that the film's trailer would be released on July 24, 2014.[82] Beyonc\u00e9 debuted a teaser for the trailer on her Instagram account five days before the trailer's release.[83] On July 24, Dornan and Johnson were on The Today Show to present part of the trailer appropriate for morning television; the full trailer, which contained more racy scenes, was released later the same day on the internet (200 days before its initial theatrical release). The trailer featured a new version of \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyonc\u00e9, which was scored and arranged by her frequent collaborator Boots.[84][85][86][87] The trailer was viewed 36.4 million times in the week after its July 24 release. This made it the most viewed trailer on YouTube in 2014, until it was surpassed in October by the trailer for Avengers: Age of Ultron.[88] However, in mid-December the trailer reached 93 million views and was again the most viewed of 2014.[89] The trailer accumulated over 100 million views in its first week of release through different channels and websites, becoming the biggest trailer ever released in history.[90] By February 2015, the trailer had been viewed more than 193 million times on YouTube alone.[91] And by late February, Fifty Shades of Grey related material garnered over 329 million views including 113 million views for its official trailer.[87] A second trailer was released on November 13, 2014.[92] A third trailer aired during Super Bowl XLIX, on February 1, 2015.[93]\nThe film was promoted through an ad campaign that asked people whether they were \"curious\".[94] Nick Carpou, Universal's president of domestic distribution, said: \"Our campaign gave people permission to see the film.\"[95] \"Valentines is a big deal for couples and a great relationship event, and the date with the long Presidents Day weekend created a perfect storm for us. This date positioned us to take full advantage of the romance angle, which is how we sold the film in our marketing campaign,\" he said.[96]\nThere was initial speculation that the film could receive an NC-17 rating in the United States. Studios typically steer away from the adults-only rating due to the impact the classification has on a film's commercial viability, with some theater chains refusing to exhibit NC-17-rated films. While screenwriter Marcel said she expected the film to be NC-17-rated,[97] producer De Luca anticipated the less restrictive R rating.[98] On January 5, 2015, the MPAA did give the film an R rating, basing its decision on \"strong sexual content including dialogue, some unusual behavior and graphic nudity, and language.\"[99]\nOn January 30, in Australia, the film was rated MA15+ by the ACB for \"strong sex scenes, sexual themes and nudity\".[100] On February 2, 2015, the British BBFC classified the film an 18 certificate, mentioning \"strong sex\".[2] In Canada, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia, the film was rated at 18A by the OFRB, MFCB, AFR, and BCFCO, respectively, due to its \"occasional upsetting or disturbing scenes, and partial or full nudity in a brief sexual situation.\"[101][102] In Quebec, the R\u00e9gie du cin\u00e9ma rated the movie under the 16+ category for its eroticism.[103] In France, the film earned a 12 rating.[104] In Lebanon, the film earned an NC-21 rating.[105] In Argentina, the Advisory Commission of Cinematographic Exhibition (the rating arm of the INCAA) rated the film SAM16/R.[106]\nAnti-pornography watchdog group Morality in Media argued that the film's R rating \"severely undermines the violent themes in the film and does not adequately inform parents and patrons of the film's content\", and that the MPAA was encouraging sexual violence by letting the film by without an NC-17 rating.[107][108]\nThe film was scheduled for a February 12, 2015, release in Malaysia, but it was denied a certificate by the Malaysian Film Censorship Board (LPF) for its \"unnatural\" and \"sadistic\" content. The LPF chairman, Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid, said Fifty Shades was \"more pornography than a movie.\"[109][110]\nThe film was also banned in Indonesia,[111] Kenya,[111] Russia's North Caucasus,[112] the United Arab Emirates (UAE),[113] Papua New Guinea,[114] Cambodia,[115] and India.[116] The film was released in Nigeria for a week, before being removed from cinemas by the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB).[117] Studios will not pursue a theatrical release in China.[111]\nThe film's sex scenes were censored after protests from various religious groups in the Philippines, and as a result it is in limited release in that country with an R-18 rating from the MTRCB.[110] A similarly cut version was released in Zimbabwe.[118]\nRoughly 20 minutes were cut from the film for screening in Vietnam, leaving no sex scenes. The scene in which Ana is beaten with a belt is skipped entirely.[119]\nOn January 28, 2015, a campaign in the United States by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation started two petitions to boycott the film's release. Their website makes more than 50 allegations that the film has a negative impact on the community. It said, \"Hollywood is advertising the Fifty Shades story as an erotic love affair, but it is really about sexual abuse and violence against women. The porn industry has poised men and women to receive the message that sexual violence is enjoyable. Fifty Shades models this porn message and Hollywood cashes the check.\"[120] By February 7, one of the petitions had garnered more than 53,000 signatures.[121]\nOn February 2, in Michigan, a man petitioned to halt the film's release at a local Celebration! Cinema. Despite the man's efforts, the president of the cinemas declined to cancel the release of the film. He said, \"We've been in business for 70 years and people often times object to content, and it's not our job to censor the content of a widespread movie. It's not in our best interest. It's not in the community's best interest.\" The film sold 3,000 tickets before the release and was expected to sell a total of 10,000 tickets.[122][123]\nThe American Family Association called for theaters not to show the film: \"The irony is not lost that the film's main character is named, 'Christian,' while this film presents anything but a 'Christian' view of intimacy ... It is the epitome of elevating abuse, and we call on all theaters to reject promoting such abuse on their screens.\"[124]\nThomas Williams of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture commented on the release of the film in the United States on Valentine's Day, stating \"The irony of Universal Pictures' decision to release its bondage-erotica film Fifty Shades of Grey on the day dedicated to honoring a Christian martyr has not gone unnoticed to many observers, who seem to find the choice unclassy at best.\"[125]\nFifty Shades of Grey was released via DVD and Blu-ray on May 8, 2015. The Blu-ray edition features an unrated cut of the film;[126] the version includes an additional three minutes of footage, the bulk of which are in the form of an alternate ending.\nUpon its release on home media in the U.S., the film topped both the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks combined Blu-ray Disc and DVD sales, as well as the Blu-ray Disc sales chart for two consecutive weeks up to the week ending May 17, 2015.[127]\nFifty Shades of Grey grossed $166.2 million in North America and $404.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $571 million, against a budget of $40 million.[3] It is currently the fourth-highest-grossing film directed by a woman (behind  Mamma Mia!, Kung Fu Panda 2, and Wonder Woman),[128] and at the time of the end of it's theatrical run, it was the fourth-highest-grossing R-rated film of all time (behind The Hangover Part II, The Passion of the Christ, and The Matrix Reloaded).[129] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $256.55 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[130]\nTickets went on sale in the United States from January 11, 2015.[91] According to ticket-selling site Fandango, Fifty Shades of Grey is the fastest-selling R-rated title in the site's 15-year history, surpassing Sex and the City 2.[131] It also had the biggest first week of ticket sales on Fandango for a non-sequel film, surpassing 2012's The Hunger Games.[131][132] It is fourth overall on Fandango's list of top advance ticket sales behind The Twilight Saga: New Moon, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2, and The Hunger Games.[133] The demand prompted US theater owners to add new showtimes.[131][134] Weeks before the film's release, several box office analysts suggested as much as a $60 million domestic four-day opening[91][135][136][137][138] while Box Office Mojo reported that a $100 million opening could be possible.[139]\nOutside the United States, Fifty Shades of Grey pre-sold 4.5 million tickets in 39 markets.[140] In the UK, it sold \u00c2\u00a31.3 million ($1.9 million) worth of tickets a week before release.[141] On release, it set several records at the box office, including:\nIn the U.S. and Canada, it is the highest-grossing sex film,[150] the seventeenth highest-grossing film of 2015,[151] and the fourth-highest-grossing romantic film of all time.[152] It opened in the U.S. and Canada simultaneously with Kingsman: The Secret Service on Thursday, February 12, 2015, across 2,830 theaters[153][154] and was widened to 3,646 theaters the next day making it the widest R-rated opening (surpassed by Mad Max: Fury Road),[155] and the fourth-widest R-rated release of all time.[156] It earned $8.6 million from Thursday night previews which is the second-highest late-night gross for a film released in February (behind Deadpool) and the third-highest for an R-rated film (behind Deadpool and The Hangover Part II).[153][157] The film topped the box office on its opening day grossing $30.2 million (including Thursday previews) from 3,646 theaters setting a record for highest February opening day (previously held by The Passion of the Christ) and fourth-highest overall among R-rated films.[158][159] During its traditional three-day opening the film opened at No. 1 at the box office earning $85.1 million, setting records for the biggest opening weekend for a film released in February (a record previously held by The Passion of the Christ).[146] Women comprised 82% of the total audiences during its opening day,[160] and 68% on Valentine's Day.[161]\nRevenue from the second weekend dropped massively by 73.9% to $22.25 million, which is the second-biggest drop for a 3,000-plus-screen release (only behind Friday the 13th's 80.4% drop) and the biggest for a 3,500-plus-screen release.[162][163][164] It is just the eighth film to open on more than 3,000 screens to drop by 70% or more.[165] The film topped the box office for two consecutive weekends before falling to No. 4 in its third weekend while Focus took the top spot.[166][167]\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, box office analysts were predicting as much as $158 million opening.[168][169][170] It opened Wednesday, February 11, 2015, in 4 countries, earning $3.7 million.[171] It opened in 34 more countries on February 12, earning $28.6 million in two days.[172] The film set opening-day records for Universal Pictures in 25 markets and opening day records for an R-rated film in 34 territories.[169][170] Through Sunday, February 15, it earned an opening-weekend total of $156 million from 58 countries from 10,979 screens ($173.6 million through Monday) where it opened at No. 1 in 54 of the 58 countries, marking the biggest overseas opening for an R-rated film, the fourth-biggest of 2015, and Universal's third-biggest overseas opening weekend ever.[148] The film set an all-time opening record in 13 markets, Universal's biggest opening weekend ever in 30 markets and biggest opening for any R-rated film in 31 markets.[148]\nThe biggest opener outside of the United States was witnessed in the UK, Ireland and Malta, where it earned \u00c2\u00a313.55 million ($20.8 million) in its opening weekend, which is the biggest debut ever for an 18-rated film and the second-biggest for a non-sequel film (behind I Am Legend).[173][174] In just 10 days of release it became the highest-grossing 18-rated film of all time.[175] It topped the UK box office for two consecutive weekends.[176] Other high openings include Germany ($14.1 million), France ($12.3 million), Russia ($11 million), Italy ($10.1 million), Spain ($8.7 million), Brazil ($8.3 million), Mexico ($8.1 million), Australia ($8 million).[148] In Japan, the film was unsuccessful opening at No. 5 with $682,000 but falling out of the top 10 the following week.[177][178] The Hollywood Reporter cited out possible reasons for the film's failure, attributing it to the \"delayed release of the new Japanese-language editions of the books, poor timing for the film release and an R-15, re-edit blurring out parts of the sex scenes.\"[179]\nIt topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends[180] until it was overtaken by Warner Bros.' Jupiter Ascending in its fourth weekend.[181] It became Universal Pictures' highest-grossing R-rated film of all time overseas (breaking Ted's record),[149] Universal Pictures' highest-grossing film in 14 countries,[nb 1] and Universal Pictures' eighth-highest-grossing film overseas.[182] In total earnings, its largest markets overseas are the UK, Ireland and Malta ($52.5 million), Germany ($43.7 million), Brazil, ($31.3 million), France ($29.5 million), and Spain ($22.6 million).[183][184][185]\nFifty Shades of Grey received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, with criticism aimed at its acting, screenplay, and pacing; however, some critics noted it as an improvement over the book, and others praised the performance of Dakota Johnson.[improper synthesis?] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 25% based on 261 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While creatively better endowed than its print counterpart, Fifty Shades of Grey is a less than satisfying experience on the screen.\"[186] The review aggregator website Metacritic gave the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[187] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.[188]\nClaudia Puig of USA Today wrote that \"the dialogue is laughable, the pacing is sluggish and the performances are one-note.\"[189] Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times wrote: \"Fifty Shades of Grey the movie, for the record, is not quite as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey the book. But that's not saying much\".[190] We Got This Covered critic Isaac Feldberg gave the film one and a half stars out of five and wrote that it \"feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one a sensual and stylish romance, and the other a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life. Regrettably, the latter and lesser of the two ends up on top\".[191] The Guardian lead film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film one star out of five, calling it \"the most purely tasteful and softcore depiction of sadomasochism in cinema history\" with \"strictly daytime soap\" performances.[192] A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the movie \"terrible\", but wrote that \"it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment.\"[193]\nIn a positive review for The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin called the film \"sexy, funny and self-aware in every way the original book isn't.\"[194] Elizabeth Weitzman of New York's Daily News praised the directing, screenplay, and Johnson's performance, but called Dornan's performance, the leads' chemistry, and the supporting cast \"underused\". She praised the film for honoring the essence of its source and the director's way of balancing \"atmosphere with action\".[195] In The Guardian, Jordan Hoffmann awarded the film three out of five stars, writing, \"this big screen adaptation still manages to be about people, and even a little bit sweet\", and that the sex scenes \"are there to advance the plot, and only the most buttoned-up prude will be scandalised.\"[196] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B\u00e2\u02c6\u2019, writing: \"This perfectly normal way of consuming erotica suggests that the movie Fifty Shades of Grey will work better as home entertainment, when each viewer can race past the blah-blah about how well Christian plays the piano and pause on the fleeting image of the man minus his pants.\"[197] In The Sydney Morning Herald, Timothy Laurie and Jessica Kean argue that \"the film provides a language for decision-making around violence more developed than most Hollywood fodder\", and that \"film fleshes out an otherwise legalistic concept like 'consent' into a living, breathing, and at times, uncomfortable interpersonal experience. It dramatises the dangers of unequal negotiation and the practical complexity of identifying one's limits and having them respected.\"[198]\nVarious critics have noted the similarities between Fifty Shades of Grey and Adrian Lyne's 9\u00bd Weeks (1986).[199][200][201] Both films are literary adaptations, centering on a sadomasochistic affair.[202][203]\nIn an interview in June 2017, Taylor-Johnson later admitted to regretting directing the movie claiming that her differences with E. L. James caused her to walk away from the series.[204][205]\nIn June 2012, the film company Smash Pictures announced its intent to film a pornographic version of the Fifty Shades trilogy, entitled Fifty Shades of Grey: An XXX Adaptation.[214] A release date of January 10, 2013, was announced.[215] In November 2012, Universal, which had secured the Fifty Shades film rights, filed a lawsuit against Smash Pictures, stating that the film violated its copyright in that it was not filmed as a parody adaptation but \"copies without reservation from the unique expressive elements of the Fifty Shades trilogy, progressing through the events of Fifty Shades of Grey and into the second book, Fifty Shades Darker\".[216]\nThe lawsuit asked for an injunction, for the profits from all sales of the film, as well as damages,[217] saying that \"a quickly and cheaply produced pornographic work [...] is likely to cause Plaintiffs irreparable harm by poisoning public perception of the Fifty Shades Trilogy and the forthcoming Universal films.\"[218] Smash Pictures responded to the lawsuit by issuing a counterclaim and requesting a continuance, stating that \"much or all\" of the Fifty Shades material was part of the public domain because it was originally published in various venues as a fan fiction based on the Twilight series. A lawyer for Smash Pictures further commented that the federal copyright registrations for the books were \"invalid and unenforceable\" and that the film \"did not violate copyright or trademark laws\".[219] The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and Smash Pictures agreed to stop any further production or promotion of the film.[220]\nIn April 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard, was enlisted to write the script for the film's sequel.[221] In the same month, at the 2015 Universal CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Universal announced the release dates of the sequels, with Fifty Shades Darker being released on February 10, 2017, and Fifty Shades Freed scheduled for February 9, 2018.[222] However, the sequels will not see Sam Taylor-Johnson returning as director.[223] On August 20, 2015, the U.S. House of Cards director James Foley was a frontrunner to direct the sequel.[224] In November 2015, Universal Studios announced that both films will be shot back-to-back.[225]\nA spoof version of the film, Fifty Shades of Black, was released on January 29, 2016, in North America. Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez wrote the script, in which Wayans stars as Christian Black. The film was distributed by SquareOne Entertainment in Germany and Open Road Films in the United States;[226] IM Global produce and finance it, as well as handling international releases. Kali Hawk parodied the role of Anastasia Steele, with supporting cast including Affion Crockett, Mike Epps, Jane Seymour, and Fred Willard.[227] Principal photography began on August 11, 2015, in Los Angeles, with a production budget of around $5 million.[227][228]",

        "text": "Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States, currently used by 31 states, the federal government, and the military.[1] Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies. The United States is the only Western country currently applying the death penalty,[2] one of 57 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries.[3]\nThere were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia, reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment.[4]\nSubsequently, a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia. Since then, more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death;[5] of these, more than 1,400 have been executed,[6] 161 who were sentenced to death before and after 1976 were exonerated of their conviction before their execution in the modern era.[7][8] and more than 2,900 are still on death row.[9]\nThe first recorded death sentence in the British North American colonies was carried out in 1608 on Captain George Kendall,[10] who was executed by firing squad[11] at the Jamestown colony for allegedly spying for the Spanish government.[12]\nThe Bill of Rights adopted in 1789 included the Eighth Amendment which prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. The Fifth Amendment was drafted with language implying a possible use of the death penalty, requiring a grand jury indictment for \"capital crime\" and a due process of law for deprivation of \"life\" by the government.[13] The Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868 also requires a due process of law for deprivation of life by any state.\nThe Espy file,[14] compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla, lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991. From 1930 to 2002, there were 4,661 executions in the U.S., about two-thirds of them in the first 20 years.[15] Additionally, the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1955 (the most recent).[16][17][18]\nThree states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century: Michigan in 1846 (has never executed a prisoner since achieving statehood), Wisconsin in 1853 and Maine in 1887. Rhode Island is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before Gregg v. Georgia include: Minnesota in 1911, Vermont in 1964, Iowa and West Virginia in 1965 and North Dakota in 1973. Hawaii abolished the death penalty in 1948 and Alaska in 1957, both before their statehood. Puerto Rico repealed it in 1929 and the District of Columbia in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by popular vote in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later: Arizona in 1918 and Oregon in 1978.[19] Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\", according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau.[20]\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958, when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama, the court made the first step of what would be later be called \"death is different\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with Gideon v. Wainwright.\nIn Furman v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \"unitary trial\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2, 1967.\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe Furman decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \"legal bombshell\".[4] The next day, columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was \"unlikely\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.[21]\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in Furman. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his Furman opinion. Other states adopted \"bifurcated\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Gregg v. Georgia[22] and upheld 7-2 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty - either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in Woodson v. North Carolina[23] and Roberts v. Louisiana,[24] the court struck down 5-4 statutes providing a mandatory death sentence.\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when Gary Gilmore went before a firing squad in Utah. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's Coker v. Georgia decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for that offense.\nIn the 1980 case Godfrey v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise aggravating factor.[25]\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of Atkins v. Virginia, decided on June 20, 2002,[26] held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in Roper v. Simmons[27] struck down executions for offenders under the age of 18 at the time of the crime.\nIn the 2008 case Kennedy v. Louisiana, the court also held 5-4 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including child rape. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.[28] Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the 2008 presidential election and was criticized by both major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.[29]\nIn 2004, New York and Kansas capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective state highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, who reinstated the statute in Kansas v. Marsh (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal. The state lower house has since blocked all attempts to reinstate the death penalty by adopting a valid sentencing scheme.[30] In 2016, Delaware's death penalty statute was also struck down by its state supreme court.[31]\nIn 2007, New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty by legislative vote since Gregg v. Georgia,[32] followed by New Mexico in 2009,[33][34] Illinois in 2011,[35] Connecticut in 2012,[36][37] and Maryland in 2013.[38] The repeals were not retroactive, but in New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland, governors commuted all death sentences after enacting the new law.[39] In Connecticut, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the repeal must be retroactive. New Mexico is the only state with remaining death row inmates and no present death penalty statute.[40]\nNebraska's legislature also passed a repeal in 2015, but a referendum campaign gathered enough signatures to suspend it. Capital punishment was reinstated by popular vote on November 8, 2016. The same day, California's electorate defeated a proposal to repeal the death penalty, and adopted another initiative to speed up its appeal process.[41]\nSince Furman, 11 states have organized popular votes dealing with the death penalty through the initiative and referendum process. All resulted in a vote for reinstating it, rejecting its abolition, expanding its application field, specifying in the state constitution that it is not unconstitutional, or expediting the appeal process in capital cases.[19]\nFrom 1976 to January 1, 2017, there were 1,442 executions, of which 1,267 were by lethal injection, 158 by electrocution, 11 by gas inhalation, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad.[42] Executions rose at a near-continuous pace until 1999, when it peaked at 98. After 1999, the number of executions lowered nearly every year, and the 20 executions in 2016 were the fewest since 1991.[6]\nThe death penalty was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, \"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\" Dukakis replied, \"No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\" Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as the beginning of the end of his campaign.[43]\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act to streamline the appeal process in capital cases. The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who had endorsed capital punishment during his 1992 presidential campaign.\nA study found that at least 34 of the 749 executions carried out in the U.S. between 1977 and 2001, or 4.5%, involved \"unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner\". The rate of these \"botched executions\" remained steady over the period.[44] A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics in the prisoner was insufficient to ensure unconsciousness.[45] Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and again in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.[46]\nIn 1632, 24 years after the first recorded male execution in the colonies, Jane Champion became the first woman to be lawfully executed.[47] She was sentenced to death by hanging after she was convicted of murder in front of a grand jury.[48] The second half of the 1600s saw the executions of 14 women and 6 men who were accused of witchcraft during the witch hunt hysteria and the Salem Witch Trials. While both men and women were executed, 80% of the accusations were towards women, so the list of executions disproportionately affected women by a margin of 7 to 3.[49]\nOther notable female executions include Mary Surratt, Margie Velma Barfield and Wanda Jean Allen. Mary Surrat was executed by hanging in 1865 after being convicted of co-conspiring about Abraham Lincoln's assassination.[50] Margie Velma Barfield was convicted of murder and when she was executed by lethal injection in 1984, she became the first woman to be executed since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.[51] Wanda Jean Allen was convicted of murder in 1989 and had a high profile execution by lethal injection in January 2001. She was the first black woman to be executed in the US since 1954.[52] According to Allen's lawyers, prosecutors capitalized on her low IQ, race and homosexuality in their representations of her as a murderer at trial.[53]\nAggravating factors for seeking capital punishment of murder vary greatly among death penalty states. California has twenty-two;[54] New Hampshire has seven.[55] Some aggravating circumstances are nearly universal, such as robbery-murder, murder involving rape of the victim, and murder of an on-duty police officer.[56]\nSeveral states have included child murder to their list of aggravating factors, but the victim's age under which the murder is punishable by death varies. In 2011, Texas raised this age from six to ten.[57]\nIn some states, the high number of aggravating factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony).[58] Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.[59]\nThe opinion of the court in Kennedy v. Louisiana says that the ruling does not apply to \"treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State\".[60]\nSince no one is on death row for such offenses, the court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty applied for them.\nTreason, espionage and large-scale drug trafficking are all capital crimes under federal law. Treason is also punishable by death in six states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri). Vermont still has a pre-Furman statute providing the death penalty for treason despite removing capital punishment for murder in 1965.[61] Large-scale drug trafficking is punishable by death in two states (Florida and Missouri).[62] Aircraft hijacking is a capital crime in Georgia and Mississippi.\nThe legal administration of the death penalty in the United States typically involves five critical steps: (1) prosecutorial decision to seek the death penalty (2) sentencing, (3) direct review, (4) state collateral review, and (5) federal habeas corpus.\nClemency, through which the Governor or President of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is an executive rather than judicial process.[63]\nWhile judges in criminal cases can usually impose a harsher prison sentence than the one demanded by prosecution, the death penalty can be handed down only if the accuser has specifically decided to seek it.\nIn the decades since Furman, new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness. A study by Pepperdine University School of Law published in Temple Law Review, surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \"idiosyncrasies\", suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \"special circumstances\", making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases.[64]\nA proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.[65]\nOf the 31 states with the death penalty, 29 provide the sentence to be decided by a jury, and 28 require a unanimous sentence.\nHowever, the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury:[66][67]\nThe first outcome is referred as the \"true unanimity\" rule, while the third has been criticized as the \"single-juror veto\" rule.[69]\nIn Alabama, the sentence is decided by the jury and at least 10 jurors must concur. A retrial happens if the jury deadlock.[70]\nNebraska is the only state in which the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel. If one of the judges on the panel opposes death, the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment.[71] Montana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone.[72]\nIn all states in which the jury is involved, only death-qualified veniremen can be selected in such a jury, to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it.\nIf a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review.[73] The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not.[74] Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand.[73] If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing.[75] Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.[75] About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.[76]\nAt times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.[77] Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.[78] Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.[79] Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.[80]\nIn Virginia, state habeas corpus for condemned men are heard by the state supreme court under exclusive original jurisdiction since 1995, immediately after direct review by the same court.[81] This avoids any proceeding before the lower courts, and is in part why Virginia has the shortest time on average between death sentence and execution (less than eight years) and has executed 113 offenders since 1976 with only five remaining on death row as of June 2017.[82][83]\nTo reduce litigation delays, other states require convicts to file their state collateral appeal before the completion of their direct appeal,[84] or provide adjudication of direct and collateral attacks together in a \"unitary review\".[85]\nAfter a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.[86] According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.[80]\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\".[87] Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\".[88] The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review.\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.[89]\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious habeas procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.[90] Under this program, federal habeas corpus for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, Congress conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the U.S. attorney general, with a possible appeal of the state to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As of March 2016, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.[91]\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a writ of habeas corpus, the death sentence becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another way of federal litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871 - codified at 42 U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01983 - which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\nWhile the aforementioned appeals are normally limited to one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.[92]\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.[93] In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\nWhile the execution warrant is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.[94]\nWithin the context of the overall murder rate, the death penalty cannot be said to be widely or routinely used in the United States; in recent years the average has been about one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions.\nAlabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences. This is because Alabama was one of the few states that allowed judges to override a jury recommendation in favor of life imprisonment, a possibility it removed in March 2017.[95][96]\nThe distribution of death sentences among states is loosely proportional to their populations and murder rates. California, which is the most populous state, has also the largest death row with over 700 inmates. Wyoming, which is the least populous state, has only one condemned man.\nBut executions are more frequent (and happen more quickly after sentencing) in conservative states. Texas, which is the second most populous state of the Union, carried out over 500 executions during the post-Furman era, more than a third of the national total. California has carried out only 13 executions during the same period.[97][98][99]\nAfrican Americans made up 41% of death row inmates while making up only 12.6% of the general population. They have made up 34% of those actually executed since 1976. However, this is an under-representation relative to the proportion of convicted murderers; 52.5% of all homicide offenders between 1980 and 2008 were African Americans.[100] According to a 2003 Amnesty International report, blacks and whites were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, yet 80% of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims.[101]\nApproximately 13.5% of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent, while they make up 17.4% of the general population.[102]\nAs of October 1, 2016, the Death Penalty Information Center reports that there are only 54 women on death row. This constitutes 1.86% of the total death row population. 16 women have been executed since 1976,[103] while 1442 men have been executed.[104] 15,391 total confirmed lawful executions have been carried out in the US since 1608, and of these, 575, or 3.6%, were women. Women account for 1/50 death sentences, 1/67 people on death row, and 1/100 people whose executions are actually carried out. The states that have executed the most women are California, Texas and Florida. For women, the racial breakdown of those sentenced to death is 21% black, 13% Latina, 2% American Indian, 61% white and 3% Asian.[103]\nAll 31 states with the death penalty provide lethal injection as the primary method of execution.\nSome states allow other methods than lethal injection, but only as secondary methods to be used merely at the request of the prisoner or if lethal injection is unavailable.[105][106]\nSeveral states continue to use the historical three-drug protocol: an anesthetic, pancuronium bromide a paralytic, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.[107] Eight states have used a single-drug protocol, inflicting only an overdose of a single anesthetic to the prisoner.[107]\nWhile some state statutes specify the drugs required, a majority do not, giving more flexibility to corrections officials.[107]\nPressures from anti-death penalty activists and shareholders have made it difficult for correctional services to get the chemicals. Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011.[108] In 2016, it was reported that more than 20 U.S. and European drug manufacturers including Pfizer (the owner of Hospira) had taken steps to prevent their drugs from being used for lethal injections.[108][109][110]\nSince then, some states have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, etomidate,[111] or fast-acting benzodiazepines like midazolam.[112] Many states have since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members.[108][113] In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.[114]\nIn 2009, Ohio approved the use of an intramuscular injection of 500\u00a0mg of hydromorphone (a 333-fold overdose for an opioid-na\u00efve patient of this narcotic analgesic closely related to and five times stronger than morphine; this is the equivalent of an entire 50-ml bottle of Dilaudid HP, the most powerful commercially available form, although the advantage of hydromorphone is its very high solubility allowing for solutions of almost arbitrary concentration; 500\u00a0mg of hydromorphone HCl as pure powder can be dissolved in isotonic saline in volumes as small as under 2 cc)[115] and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.[116][117]\nLethal injection was held to be a constitutional method of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court in two cases: Baze v. Rees (2008) and Glossip v. Gross (2015).[118][119]\nIn the following states, death row inmates with an execution warrant may choose to be executed by:[105][106]\nIn five states (Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Utah), the alternative method is offered only to inmates sentenced to death for crimes committed prior to a specified date (usually when the state switched from the earlier method to lethal injection).\nWhen an offender chooses to be executed by a means different from the state default method, which is always lethal injection, he loses the right to challenge its constitutionality in court. See Stewart v. LaGrand, 526 US 115 (1999).\nThe last executions by methods other than injection are as follows (all chosen by the inmate):\nDepending on the state, the following alternative methods are statutorily provided in the event that lethal injection is either found unconstitutional by a court or unavailable for practical reasons:[105][106][120]\nOklahoma is the only state allowing more than two methods of execution in its statutes, providing lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, electrocution and firing squad to be used in that order in the event that all earlier methods are unavailable. The nitrogen option was added by the Oklahoma Legislature in 2015 and has never been used in a judicial execution, though it is routinely used to give a painless death in animal euthanasia.[121]\nThree states (Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah) have added back-up methods recently in 2014 or 2015 (or have expanded their application fields) in reaction to the shortage of lethal injection drugs.[122]\nSome states such as Florida have a larger provision dealing with execution methods unavailability, requiring their state departments of corrections to use \"any constitutional method\" if both lethal injection and electrocution are found unconstitutional. This was designed to make unnecessary any further legislative intervention in that event, but the provision apply only to legal (not practical) infeasibility.[123][124]\nIn May 2016, an Oklahoma grand jury recommended the state to use nitrogen hypoxia as its primary method of execution rather than as a mere backup, after experts testified that the method would be painless, easy and \"inexpensive\".[125]\nThe method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution.\nThe federal government has a facility (at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute) and regulations only for executions by lethal injection, but the United States Code allows U.S. Marshals to use state facilities and employees for federal executions.[126][127]\nThe last public execution in the U.S. was that of Rainey Bethea in Owensboro, Kentucky, on August 14, 1936.\nIt was the last execution in the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without any legally imposed restrictions. \"Public execution\" is a legal phrase, defined by the laws of various states, and carried out pursuant to a court order. Similar to \"public record\" or \"public meeting\", it means that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so.\nAround 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \"wall\" or \"enclosure\", or to \"exclude public view\". Most states laws currently use such explicit wording to prohibit public executions, while others do so only implicitly by enumerating the only authorized witnesses.[128]\nAll states allow news reporters to be execution witnesses for information of the general public, except Wyoming which allow only witnesses authorized by the condemned.[129][130][131] Several states also allow victims' families and relatives selected by the prisoner to watch executions. An hour or two before the execution, the condemned is offered religious services and to choose his last meal (except in Texas which abolished it in 2011).\nThe execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001, was witnessed by over 200 people, most by closed-circuit television.\nGallup, Inc. monitors support for the death penalty in the United States since 1937 by asking \"Are you in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?\" Gallup surveys document a sharp increase in support for capital punishment between 1966 and 1994 clearly in response to rising violent crime rates during this period (e.g Page and Shapiro 1992.) However, with the dramatic surge in arguments questioning the fairness of the sentence (due, in part, to DNA exonerations of death row inmates in the national media in the late 1990s (Baumgartner, De Boef, and Boydstun 2004 The Decline of the Death Penalty and the Discovery of Innocence ),[132] support then began to wane, falling from 80% in 1994 to 66% in 2000. Moreover, approval varies substantially depending on the characteristics of the target and the alternatives posed, with much lower support for putting juveniles and the mentally ill to death (26% and 19%, respectively, in 2002) and for the alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (52% in 2003) Gallup 2005). Given the fact that attitudes toward this policy are often responsive to events, to characteristics of the target, and to alternatives, the conventional wisdom\u2014that death penalty attitudes are impervious to change\u2014is surely overstated. Accordingly, any analysis of death penalty attitudes must account for the responsiveness of such attitudes, as well as their reputed resistance to change[133] In their last poll in October 2016, 60% of respondents said they were in favor and 37% were opposed.[134] A month earlier, a Pew Research poll found that 49% of Americans supported the death penalty for convicted murderers and 42% opposed, down from 80% in 1974.[135]\nA 2010 poll found that 61% of voters would choose a penalty other than the death sentence for murder.[136] When persons surveyed are given a choice between the death penalty and life without parole for persons convicted of capital crimes, support for execution has traditionally been significantly lower than in polling that asks only if a person does or does not support the death penalty. In 2010, for instance, a Gallup poll that offered a choice showed 49% favoring the death penalty, and 46% favoring life imprisonment.[137]\nOn the other hand, in November 2009, another Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans say that September 11 attacks' mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should get the death penalty if convicted, including 12 who normally opposed the death penalty when asked the 1937 question.[138] A similar result was found in 2001 when respondents were polled about the execution of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 victims.[139]\nCapital punishment is a controversial issue, with many prominent organizations and individuals participating in the debate. Amnesty International and other groups oppose capital punishment on moral grounds.\nSome law enforcement organizations, and some victims' rights groups support capital punishment.\nThe United States is one of four industrialized democracies that still practice capital punishment with Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan.\nReligious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment.[140] The Fiqh Council of North America, a group of highly influential Muslim scholars in the United States, has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met.[141]\nIn October 2009, the American Law Institute voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962, as part of the Model Penal Code, \"in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment\". A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled.[142] As of 2017[update], 159 prisoners have been exonerated due to evidence of their innocence.[136][143][144]\nAdvocates of the death penalty say that it deters crime, is a good tool for prosecutors in plea bargaining,[145] improves the community by eliminating recidivism by executed criminals, provides \"closure\" to surviving victims or loved ones, and is a just penalty.\nThe murder rate is highest in the South (6.5 per 100,000 in 2016), where 80% of executions are carried out, and lowest in the Northeast (3.5 per 100,000), with less than 1% of executions. A report by the US National Research Council in 2012 stated that studies claiming a deterrent effect are \"fundamentally flawed\" and should not be used for policy decisions.[136]\nAccording to a survey of the former and present presidents of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top academic criminological societies, 88% of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder. (Radelet & Lacock, 2009)[136]\nData shows that the application of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias.[136] Furthermore, some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that has been shown to be biased through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors.[146] Another argument in the capital punishment debate is the cost.[147][136]\nThe largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in Illinois when outgoing Governor George Ryan, who had already imposed a moratorium on executions, pardoned four death-row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[148] When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011, he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life imprisonment.[35]\nPrevious post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico, when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms (1979-1987) as Florida's Governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality.\nAll executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008. At that time, the U.S. Supreme Court was examining the constitutionality of lethal injection in Baze v. Rees. This was the longest period with no executions in the United States since 1982. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld this method in a 7-2 ruling.\nIn addition to the states that have no valid death penalty statute, the following states and jurisdictions are noted that have an official moratorium, or have had no executions for more than ten years, as of 2017:\nKansas, New Hampshire, Wyoming, and the U.S. Military have also no executions for over ten years, but in these states it is because of the lack of death row inmates having exhausted the appeal process.\nSince 1976, four states have executed only condemned prisoners who voluntarily waived further appeals: Pennsylvania has executed three inmates, Oregon two, Connecticut one, and New Mexico one.\nIn North Carolina, executions are suspended following a decision by the state's medical board that physicians cannot participate in executions, which is a requirement under state law.\nIn California, United States District Judge Jeremy Fogel suspended all executions in the state on December 15, 2006, ruling that the implementation used in California was unconstitutional but that it could be fixed.[153]\nOn November 25, 2009, the Kentucky Supreme Court suspended executions until the state adopts regulations for carrying out the penalty by lethal injection.[154]\nIn November 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium on executions in Oregon, canceling a planned execution and ordering a review of the death penalty system in the state.[155]\nOn February 11, 2014, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a capital punishment moratorium. All death penalty cases that come to Inslee will result in him issuing a reprieve, not a pardon or commutation.[156]\nOn February 13, 2015, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced a moratorium on the death penalty. Wolf will issue a reprieve for every execution until a commission on capital punishment, which was established in 2011 by the Pennsylvania State Senate, produces a recommendation.[157] Effectively there was a moratorium in place, as the state had not executed anyone since Gary M.

She also fights other supernatural beings that inhabit the Ghost River Triangle, a cursed territory near the Canadian Rockies that includes Purgatory, her home town. Upon her 27th birthday, Wynonna inherited the special power to return revenants to Hell with her ancestor's 16-inch barrel special \"Peacemaker\" revolver. She is recruited by the Black Badge Division (BBD), a secret government agency led by Special Agent Xavier Dolls which eventually includes an ageless Doc Holliday and Wynonna's sister, Waverly Earp. Nicole Haught, Waverly's girlfriend and a Purgatory Sheriff's Deputy, assists the team in her local police role.\nThe first season centers on Wynonna fighting the revenants who kidnapped her older sister Willa from their homestead when they were girls, and the threat posed by Bobo Del Rey, leader of the local revenants. In the second season Wynonna discovers she is pregnant, while Waverly struggles with possession by a demon and doubts about her lineage. At the same time, two sister-wife widows of the dead sheriff who cursed Wyatt Earp seek to resurrect him.\nEpisodes of Season 1 featured Dylan Koroll as Champ Hardy, Waverly's boyfriend before she met Officer Nicole Haught; Natascha Girgis as Gus McCready, aunt of the Earp girls; and David LeReaney as Judge Cryderman, an antagonist of Wynonna Earp.\nSyfy acquired the U.S. rights to Wynonna Earp from SEVEN24 Films and IDW Entertainment in July 2015 and placed an order for 13 episodes.[27] International distribution of the series was acquired by Dynamic Television in September 2015.[28] On September 30, 2015, SEVEN24 Films announced the acquisition of Canadian broadcast rights by over-the-air independent station CHCH-DT.[6]\nMelanie Scrofano was cast in the title role,[29] with Tim Rozon as Doc Holliday and Shamier Anderson as Agent Dolls.[1] Dominique Provost-Chalkley was cast as Waverly Earp.[30] In recurring roles, Michael Eklund was cast as villain Bobo Del Rey[31] and Katherine Barrell as Officer Nicole Haught.[32]\n\"Tell That Devil\" by singer-songwriter Jill Andrews was selected as the theme music for the series.[33] The titles of Wynonna Earp episodes are based on country and western songs.[34][35]\nViacom International Media Networks acquired the rights to broadcast Wynonna Earp on its multinational Spike channels in July 2016.[36][37] In March 2017, Bell Media announced the new partnership between Space and SEVEN24 Films as Canadian co-producers of the series.[15]\nFilming of Season 1 took place from September 14, 2015, to February 12, 2016, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.[38][39] Locations included Bridgeland, Inglewood, and Heritage Park.[40] Didsbury, Alberta, was used as the setting for the series' small town of Purgatory.[41][42]\nSyfy released the first promotional images and synopsis for the series on November 6, 2015.[43] The teaser trailer was released through IGN in January 2016.[44]\nWynonna Earp premiered on April 1, 2016, on Syfy;[45] and on April 4, 2016, on CHCH-DT.[8]\nAfter the series was renewed for a second season, Melanie Scrofano found out that she was pregnant.

[72][73]\nIn its new series review, Collider gave Wynonna Earp four stars, calling it \"a fresh and familiar take on zombies, the Wild West, and gunslinger culture\" and \"something that also feels different to anything we're seeing on TV currently, thanks not only to its setting, but its prominent placement of so many strong, profane, kickass female characters.\"[74] Digital Journal said the series was \"smart\" and \"complex\" with \"a lot going for it\".[75] The A.V. Club called Melanie Scrofano \"the right woman for the job...an easy, authoritative presence\"; and \"when it's allowed the room to run, Wynonna Earp delights in itself,\" adding that the series \"could grow into the good-time Western pulp it has the potential to be.\"[76] In a post-Season 1 review for Salon, Melanie McFarland wrote: \"This modern Western proved its mettle by dint of unexpectedly weird plotting and witty dialogue...[Melanie] Scrofano lends a hardened and slightly feral swagger to Wynonna that's vastly entertaining...Much of the show's winning spirit rests in its exploration of family loyalty and the popular conviction that one's blood and dynastic ties compel one to fulfill a prescribed destiny.\"[77]\nE! Entertainment Television named Wynonna Earp the \"Best New Show\" of 2016.[78] It was chosen by Variety as one of the 20 best new series of 2016, stating \"what this prairie-set Canadian import lacks in budget, it makes up for in gumption, sass and camaraderie.\"[79] In its annual \"Best of TV\" highlight, Collider named Wynonna Earp the \"Best New Sci-Fi\" show of 2016.[80]\nIn the United States, Season 1 averaged a total rating of 0.13 with 0.56 viewers.[81] The season received a 75% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.11/10.[82] Metacritic gave the season an average score of 68 out of 100.[83]\nSeason 2 averaged a 0.12 rating in the United States with 0.50 viewers.[84] In Canada, overall viewership increased 52% on Space compared to Season 1 on CHCH-DT.[23][24] The season received an average rating of 8.67/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.[85] There is no average score (yet) on Metacritic.[86]\nMaureen Ryan of Variety named Wynonna Earp one of the best television shows of 2017, praising it's \"fierce and committed performances\".[87]\n\"Wayhaught\", the portmanteau for the relationship between Waverly Earp and Nicole Haught, was considered one of the favorite 2017 fan \"ships\" on Tumblr, and the series was praised for how it is portrayed and acknowledged by Dominique Provost-Chalkley and Katherine Barrell.[88]\nWynonna Earp producers and cast members appeared at the Calgary International Film Festival on September 30, 2017, in a special program showcasing film and television productions in Alberta, Canada.

        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: Nobelpriset i litteratur) has been awarded annually, since 1901, to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framst\u00c3\u00a5ende verket i en idealisk riktning).[2][3] Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize,[4] the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. The prize has \"become widely seen as a political one - a peace prize in literary disguise\", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with different political tastes to them.[5] Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for \"Swedish professors ... [to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...\".[6] As of 2016, 16 of the 113 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors.[7] Some, such as Indian academic Sabaree Mitra, have noted that, though the Nobel Prize in Literature is significant and tends to overshadow other awards, it is \"not the only benchmark of literary excellence.\"[8]\nNobel's \"vague\" wording for the criteria for the prize has led to recurrent controversy. In the original Swedish, the word idealisk translates as either \"idealistic\" or \"ideal\".[3][9] The Nobel Committee's interpretation has varied over the years. In recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale.[3][10]\nAlfred Nobel stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[11][12] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[13][14] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31\u00a0million Swedish kronor (US$198 million, \u20ac176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[15] Due to the level of scepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) approved it.[16][17] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organize the prizes.\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[18][19] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[17][20][21] According to Nobel's will, the Royal Swedish Academy was to award the Prize in Literature.[21]\nEach year, the Swedish Academy sends out requests for nominations of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Members of the Academy, members of literature academies and societies, professors of literature and language, former Nobel literature laureates, and the presidents of writers' organizations are all allowed to nominate a candidate. It is not permitted to nominate oneself.[22]\nThousands of requests are sent out each year, and as of 2011[update] about 220 proposals are returned.[23] These proposals must be received by the Academy by 1 February, after which they are examined by the Nobel Committee. By April, the Academy narrows the field to around twenty candidates.[23] By May, a short list of five names is approved by the Committee.[23] The subsequent four months are then spent in reading and reviewing the works of the five candidates.[23] In October, members of the Academy vote and the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is named the Nobel laureate in Literature. No one can get the prize without being on the list at least twice, thus many of the same authors reappear and are reviewed repeatedly over the years.[23] The academy is master of thirteen languages, but when a candidate is shortlisted from an unknown language, they call on translators and oath-sworn experts to provide samples of that writer.[23] Other elements of the process are similar to that of other Nobel Prizes.[24]\nA Literature Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[25] The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year.[26] If a prize is awarded to more than one laureate, the money is either split evenly among them or, for three laureates, it may be divided into a half and two quarters.[27] If a prize is awarded jointly to two or more laureates, the money is split among them.[27]\nThe prize money of the Nobel Prize has been fluctuating since its inauguration but as of 2012[update] it stood at kr\u00a08,000,000 (about US$1,100,000), previously it was kr\u00a010,000,000.[28][29][30] This was not the first time the prize-amount was decreased\u2014beginning with a nominal value of kr\u00a0150,782 in 1901 (worth 8,123,951 in 2011 SEK) the nominal value has been as low as kr\u00a0121,333 (2,370,660 in 2011 SEK) in 1945\u2014but it has been uphill or stable since then, peaking at an SEK-2011 value of 11,659,016 in 2001.[30]\nThe laureate is also invited to give a lecture during \"Nobel Week\" in Stockholm; the highlight is the prize-giving ceremony and banquet on 10 December.[31] It is the richest literary prize in the world by a large margin.\nThe Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket[32] in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse (front side of the medal). The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.[33] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design.[34] The medal for the Nobel Prize in Literature was designed by Erik Lindberg.[35]\nNobel laureates receive a Diploma directly from the King of Sweden. Each Diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it.[36] The Diploma contains a picture and text that states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[36]\nPotential recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature are difficult to predict as nominations are kept secret for fifty years until they are publicly available at The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Currently, only nominations submitted between 1901 and 1965 are available for public viewing.[37] This secrecy has led to speculation about the next Nobel laureate.\nWhat about the rumours circling around the world about certain people being nominated for the Nobel Prize this year? - Well, either it's just a rumour, or someone among the invited nominators has leaked information. Since the nominations are kept secret for 50 years, you'll have to wait until then to find out.[38]\nAccording to Professor G\u00f6ran Malmqvist of the Swedish Academy, Chinese writer Shen Congwen was to have been awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, had he not suddenly died that year.[39]\nFrom 1901 to 1912, the committee, headed by the conservative Carl David af Wirs\u00e9n, weighed the literary quality of a work against its contribution towards humanity's struggle 'toward the ideal'. Tolstoy, Ibsen, Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favor of authors little read today.[9][40] Also, many believe Sweden's historic antipathy towards Russia is the reason neither Tolstoy nor Anton Chekhov were awarded the prize.[citation needed] During World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries.[9] August Strindberg was repeatedly bypassed by the committee, but holds the singular distinction of being awarded an Anti-Nobel Prize, conferred by popular acclaim and national subscription and presented to him in 1912 by future prime minister Hjalmar Branting.[41][42][43] James Joyce wrote the books that rank 1st and 3rd on the Modern Library 100 Best Novels \u2013 Ulysses and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man \u2013 but Joyce never won; as biographer Gordon Bowker wrote, \"That prize was just out of Joyce's reach.\"[44]\nThe academy considered Czech writer Karel \u010capek's War With the Newts too offensive to the German government. He also declined to suggest some noncontroversial publication that could be cited as an example of his work, stating \"Thank you for the good will, but I have already written my doctoral dissertation\".[45] He was thus denied the prize.\nThe choice of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f (Sweden 1858\u20131940) as Nobel Laureate in 1909 (for the 'lofty idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual perception that characterizes her writings'[46]) followed fierce debate because of her writing style and subject matter, which broke literary decorums of the time.[47][48]\nAccording to Swedish Academy archives studied by the newspaper Le Monde on their opening in 2008, French novelist and intellectual Andr\u00e9 Malraux was seriously considered for the prize in the 1950s. Malraux was competing with Albert Camus but was rejected several times, especially in 1954 and 1955, \"so long as he does not come back to novel\". Thus, Camus was awarded the prize in 1957.[49]\nSome attribute W. H. Auden's not being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to errors in his translation of 1961 Peace Prize laureate Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld's V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken (Markings)[50] and to statements that Auden made during a Scandinavian lecture tour suggesting that Hammarskj\u00f6ld was, like Auden, homosexual.[51]\nIn 1962, John Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature. The selection was heavily criticized, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper.[52] The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", adding, \"we think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\".[52] Steinbeck himself, when asked if he deserved the Nobel on the day of the announcement, replied: \"Frankly, no.\"[52] In 2012 (50 years later), the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a \"compromise choice\" among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell, French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen.[52] The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot:[52] \"There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation,\" wrote committee member Henry Olsson.[52]\nIn 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he declined it, stating that \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize laureate. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"[53]\nSoviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 prize laureate, did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the USSR would prevent his return afterwards (his works there were circulated in samizdat\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclandestine form).[54] After the Swedish government refused to honor Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy, Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether, commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes (who preferred a private ceremony) were \"an insult to the Nobel Prize itself.\" Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award and prize money until 10 December 1974, after he was deported from the Soviet Union.[55]\nIn 1974, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, and Saul Bellow were considered but rejected in favor of a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, both members of the Swedish Academy at the time,[56] and unknown outside their home country.[57][58] Bellow received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976; neither Greene nor Nabokov was awarded it.[59]\nArgentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was nominated for the Prize several times but, as Edwin Williamson, Borges's biographer, states, the Academy did not award it to him, most likely because of his support of certain Argentine and Chilean right-wing military dictators, including Augusto Pinochet, which, according to T\u00f3ib\u00edn's review of Williamson's Borges: A Life, had complex social and personal contexts.[60] Borges' failure to receive the Nobel Prize for his support of these right-wing dictators contrasts with the Committee honoring writers who openly supported controversial left-wing dictatorships, including Joseph Stalin, in the cases of Sartre and Pablo Neruda,[61][62] Also, controversially, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez supported the Cuban Revolutionary and President Fidel Castro.[63]\nThe award to Italian performance artist Dario Fo in 1997 was initially considered \"rather lightweight\"[64] by some critics, as he was seen primarily as a performer, and Catholic organizations saw the award to Fo as controversial as he had previously been censured by the Roman Catholic Church.[65] The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano expressed surprise at Fo's selection for the prize commenting that \"Giving the prize to someone who is also the author of questionable works is beyond all imagination.\"[66] Salman Rushdie and Arthur Miller had been strongly favoured to receive the Prize, but the Nobel organisers were later quoted as saying that they would have been \"too predictable, too popular.\"[67]\nCamilo Jos\u00e9 Cela willingly offered his services as an informer for Franco's regime and had moved voluntarily from Madrid to Galicia during the Spanish Civil War in order to join the rebel forces there; an article by Miguel Angel Villena, Between Fear and Impunity which compiled commentaries by Spanish novelists on the noteworthy silence of the older generation of Spanish novelists on the Francoist pasts of public intellectuals, appeared below a photograph of Cela during the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm in 1989.[68]\nThe choice of the 2004 laureate, Elfriede Jelinek, was protested by a member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlund, who had not played an active role in the Academy since 1996; Ahnlund resigned, alleging that selecting Jelinek had caused \"irreparable damage\" to the reputation of the award.[69][70]\nThe selection of Harold Pinter for the Prize in 2005 was delayed for a couple of days, apparently due to Ahnlund's resignation, and led to renewed speculations about there being a \"political element\" in the Swedish Academy's awarding of the Prize.[10] Although Pinter was unable to give his controversial Nobel Lecture in person because of ill health, he delivered it from a television studio on video projected on screens to an audience at the Swedish Academy, in Stockholm. His comments have been the source of much commentary and debate. The issue of their \"political stance\" was also raised in response to the awards of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Orhan Pamuk and Doris Lessing in 2006 and 2007, respectively.[71]\nThe 2016 choice of Bob Dylan was the first time a musician and song-writer won the Nobel for Literature. The award caused some controversy, particularly among writers arguing that the literary merits of Dylan\u2019s work are not equal to those of some of his peers. Lebanese novelist Rabih Alameddine tweeted that \"Bob Dylan winning a Nobel in Literature is like Mrs Fields being awarded 3 Michelin stars.\"[72] The French Moroccan writer Pierre Assouline described the decision \"contemptuous of writers\".[73] In a live webchat hosted by The Guardian, Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd said that \"I\u2019m very divided. I love that the novel committee opens up for other kinds of literature \u2013 lyrics and so on. I think that\u2019s brilliant. But knowing that Dylan is the same generation as Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, makes it very difficult for me to accept it.\" [74] Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh said \"I'm a Dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.\"[75] Dylan's songwriting peer and friend Leonard Cohen said that no prizes were necessary to recognize the greatness of the man who transformed pop music with records like Highway 61 Revisited. \"To me,\" Cohen said, \"[the Nobel] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain.\"[76] Writer and commentator Will Self wrote that the award \"cheapened\" Dylan whilst hoping the laureate would \"follow Sartre in rejecting the award\".[77]\nThe prize's focus on European men, and Swedes in particular, has been the subject of criticism, even from Swedish newspapers.[78] The majority of laureates have been European, with Sweden itself receiving more prizes (8) than all of Asia (7, if Orhan Pamuk is included), as well as all of Latin America (7, if Derek Walcott is included). In 2009, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that \"Europe still is the center of the literary world\" and that \"the US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature.\"[79]\nIn 2009, Engdahl's replacement, Peter Englund, rejected this sentiment (\"In most language areas ... there are authors that really deserve and could get the Nobel Prize and that goes for the United States and the Americas, as well\") and acknowledged the Eurocentric nature of the award, saying that, \"I think that is a problem. We tend to relate more easily to literature written in Europe and in the European tradition.\"[80] American critics are known to object that those from their own country, like Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon, and Cormac McCarthy, have been overlooked, as have Latin Americans such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, and Carlos Fuentes, while in their place Europeans lesser-known to that continent have triumphed. The 2009 award to Herta M\u00fcller, previously little-known outside Germany but many times named favorite for the Nobel Prize, re-ignited the viewpoint that the Swedish Academy was biased and Eurocentric.[81]\nHowever, the 2010 prize was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa, a native of Peru in South America. When the 2011 prize was awarded to the eminent Swedish poet Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Peter Englund said the prize was not decided based on politics, describing such a notion as \"literature for dummies\".[82] The Swedish Academy awarded the next two prizes to non-Europeans, Chinese author Mo Yan and Canadian short story writer Alice Munro. French writer Patrick Modiano's win in 2014 renewed questions of Eurocentrism; when asked by The Wall Street Journal \"So no American this year, yet again. Why is that?\", Englund reminded Americans of the Canadian origins of the previous year's winner, the Academy's desire for literary quality and the impossibility of rewarding everyone who deserves the prize.[83]\nIn the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature, many literary achievements were overlooked. The literary historian Kjell Espmark admitted that \"as to the early prizes, the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justified. Tolstoy, Ibsen, and Henry James should have been rewarded instead of, for instance, Sully Prudhomme, Eucken, and Heyse\".[84] There are omissions which are beyond the control of the Nobel Committee such as the early death of an author as was the case with Marcel Proust, Italo Calvino, and Roberto Bola\u00f1o. According to Kjell Espmark \"the main works of Kafka, Cavafy, and Pessoa were not published until after their deaths and the true dimensions of Mandelstam's poetry were revealed above all in the unpublished poems that his wife saved from extinction and gave to the world long after he had perished in his Siberian exile\".[84] British novelist Tim Parks ascribed the never-ending controversy surrounding the decisions of the Nobel Committee to the \"essential silliness of the prize and our own foolishness at taking it seriously\"[85] and noted that \"eighteen (or sixteen) Swedish nationals will have a certain credibility when weighing up works of Swedish literature, but what group could ever really get its mind round the infinitely varied work of scores of different traditions. And why should we ask them to do that?\"[85]\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is not the only literary prize for which all nationalities are eligible. Other notable international literary prizes include the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Franz Kafka Prize, the Man Booker International Prize, and the recently reinstated Formentor Prize. In contrast to the other prizes mentioned, the Neustadt International Prize is awarded biennially. The journalist Hephzibah Anderson has noted that the Man Booker International Prize \"is fast becoming the more significant award, appearing an ever more competent alternative to the Nobel\".[86] The Man Booker International Prize \"highlights one writer's overall contribution to fiction on the world stage\"[87] and \"has literary excellence as its sole focus\".[87] Established in 2005, it is not yet possible to analyze its importance on potential future Nobel Prize in Literature laureates. Only Alice Munro (2009) has been awarded with both. However, some winners of the Man Booker International Prize, such as Ismail Kadare (2005) and Philip Roth (2011) are considered contenders for the Nobel Prize in Literature.[citation needed] The Neustadt International Prize for Literature is regarded as one of the most prestigious international literary prizes, often referred to as the American equivalent to the Nobel Prize.[88][89] Like the Nobel or the Man Booker International Prize, it is awarded not for any one work, but for an entire body of work. It is frequently seen as an indicator of who may be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1972 Neustadt, 1982 Nobel), Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1978 Neustadt, 1980 Nobel), Octavio Paz (1982 Neustadt, 1990 Nobel), Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer (1990 Neustadt, 2011 Nobel) were first awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature before being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nAnother award of note is the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award (formerly Prince of Asturias Award) in Letters. During the first years of its existence it was almost exclusively awarded to writers in the Spanish language, but in more recent times writers in other languages have been awarded as well. Writers who have won both the Asturias Award in Letters and the Nobel Prize in Literature include Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela, G\u00fcnter Grass, Doris Lessing, and Mario Vargas Llosa.\nThe America Award in Literature, which does not include a monetary prize, presents itself as an alternative to the Nobel Prize in Literature. To date, Harold Pinter and Jos\u00e9 Saramago are the only writers to have received both the America Award and the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nThere are also prizes for honouring the lifetime achievement of writers in specific languages, like the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (for Spanish language, established in 1976) and the Cam\u00f5es Prize (for Portuguese language, established in 1989). Nobel laureates who were also awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize include Octavio Paz (1981 Cervantes, 1990 Nobel); Mario Vargas Llosa (1994 Cervantes, 2010 Nobel); and Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela (1995 Cervantes, 1989 Nobel). Jos\u00e9 Saramago is the only author to receive both the Cam\u00f5es Prize (1995) and the Nobel Prize (1998) to date.\nThe Hans Christian Andersen Award is sometimes referred to as \"the Little Nobel.\" The award has earned this appellation since, in a similar manner to the Nobel Prize in Literature, it recognizes the lifetime achievement of writers, though the Andersen Award focuses on a single category of literary works (children's literature).[90]",

        "text": "Sons of Anarchy is an American crime drama television series created by Kurt Sutter, that aired in 2008 and ended in 2014. It follows the lives of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in Charming, a fictional town in California's Central Valley. The show stars Charlie Hunnam as Jackson \"Jax\" Teller, who is initially the vice president and subsequently the president of the club. He soon begins to question the club and himself. Brotherhood, loyalty and redemption are constant themes.\nSons of Anarchy premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX. The series's third season attracted an average of 4.9 million weekly viewers, making it FX's highest rated series and surpassing its other hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck and Rescue Me. Season four and five premieres were the two highest-rated telecasts in FX's history.[5]\nThe sixth season aired from September 10, 2013, through December 10, 2013.[6] The seventh and final season of the series premiered on September 9, 2014. The series finale premiered on December 9, 2014.[7][8]\nThis series explores vigilantism, government corruption and racism, and depicts an outlaw motorcycle club as an analogy for human transformation. The real life Oakland Hells Angel David Labrava served as a technical advisers, and also played one of the main characters, Happy Lowman, the club's assassin.\nOn November 2013, Sutter indicated that he was in talks with FX to make a Sons of Anarchy prequel set in the 1960s. In February 2015, he said he would not work on the prequel, which is likely to be titled \"The First 9\".[8] In November 2016, FX announced the development of a spin-off series Mayans MC that will be centered around Latino culture.[9]\nEach season involves parallel plot lines that intertwine and overlap, centering on both the personal and family life of Jackson \"Jax\" Teller (Charlie Hunnam) and on SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original). SAMCRO is involved with gun-running in the western United States, and deals with rival gangs, politicians and the authorities. As vice president and later president of SAMCRO, Jax struggles to manage the club and the legacy of its founder, his late father John. SAMCRO is said to resemble the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club; the series includes appearances from David Labrava (Happy), Chuck Zito (Frankie Diamonds), Rusty Coones (Quinn), and Sonny Barger (Lenny \"The Pimp\" Janowitz) who are real Hells Angels members.\nThe series begins with the destruction of a warehouse the club uses to store and assemble guns, which is their main source of income, by a rival MC right before the overdose of Jax's Methamphetamine-addicted ex-wife Wendy. An emergency C-section is performed, and their son Abel is delivered ten weeks prematurely. Jax finds his father's memoirs when he visits a storage unit to collect some old baby clothes. John Teller, Jax's father, was one of the founders of SAMCRO, and the book describes his trials with and hopes for the club. Jax's mother, Gemma Teller-Morrow, is now married to the President of SAMCRO, Clay Morrow. Jax's best friend Opie has just been released from prison for serving time for a club-related crime. The first season deals with Jax trying to reconcile things happening to the club with what he reads in his father's memoirs, Opie trying to take a lesser role in the club, and local and federal law enforcement trying to shut down SAMCRO.\nWhite separatists called the League of American Nationalists (LOAN) arrive in Charming.[10] LOAN's leader Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's enforcer, A.J. Weston, seek to drive the Sons of Anarchy from Charming. To send a message to SAMCRO, Zobelle orchestrates to have Gemma kidnapped and gang raped by Weston and two others. Due to the improper handling of an internal problem, the rift between Clay and Jax continues to widen as Jax challenges most of Clay's decisions and comes to a head when a lone car bomb nearly kills another member of SAMCRO. The second season sees SAMCRO battling LOAN for control of Charming, Jax and Clay veering further apart in their individual visions for the club, and evading the ever-present threat of the ATF.\nGemma has been hiding in Rogue River, Oregon with Tig at the home of Gemma's father, Nate (Hal Holbrook), who suffers from dementia. Gemma struggles when she takes Nate to his new assisted living home, and he pleads to be taken back to his house. She returns to Charming to reunite with her grandson, unaware he has been kidnapped. The return of A.T.F. agent Stahl twists the facts about the murder of Donna, Stahl attempts to make a deal with Jax behind the club's back. Father Kellan Ashby's sister, Maureen, contacts Gemma at Ashby's request and tells her Abel is safe in Belfast. Upon learning of her grandson's abduction, Gemma suffers a cardiac arrhythmia and collapses in the Teller-Morrow lot. After the club returns from Ireland and brings home Abel, agent Stahl double crosses Jax and tells the club about the side deal Jax made with her, unaware that Jax and the club had it planned all along knowing Stahl would back out of the deal. Jax, Clay, Bobby, Tig, Juice and Happy are hauled away to jail. While Opie, Chibbs, and the Prospects are all en route following Stahl. Opie kills Stahl to avenge the death of his wife, Donna.\nThe imprisoned SAMCRO members leave the penitentiary after their 14-month stay and are met by Lieutenant Eli Roosevelt of the San Joaquin Sheriff's Department, the new law enforcement present in Charming. They also discover Hale has become the mayor. US Attorney Lincoln Potter seeks Lieutenant Roosevelt's help to build a RICO case against SAMCRO.\nIn retaliation for the death of Veronica Pope (Laroy's girlfriend, who was also the daughter of powerful Oakland kingpin Damon Pope), the Niners attack SAMCRO and ambush a cargo shipment. With the death of Piney Winston and the growing conflict between the Niners and SAMCRO, along with several home invasions targeting people linked to the Club, Jax is forced to meet with Damon Pope, to face a new threat unlike anything SAMCRO has ever faced.\nFollowing the arrest of Tara and Clay, Jax struggles to hold SAMCRO together while Tara is imprisoned. Toric approaches both Tara and Clay and offers them deals in exchange for giving up SAMCRO; both initially refuse, but Clay later relents when confronted with being thrown into the prison's general population and assuredly being killed by inmates paid off by Damon Pope's men as a retaliation for Pope's murder. Juice returns to Charming after helping Bobby relocate after stepping down as VP, which angers Chibs, who doesn't believe Juice has been punished enough for talking to cops and later beats him. With the growing romance between Gemma and Nero, the death of Clay Morrow, and death of Tara, the tables get turned and club starts to go in a new darker direction.\nJax struggles with his recent loss and turns himself in to the authorities. While in jail, Jax makes decisions that radically alter the direction of the club and uses it to exact revenge. Another member's death fuels the hate and lies created by Gemma and Juice, who are on the run and hiding from the club. After Jax learns the truth, he works to make things right with all parties involved. The series ends with Jax making the ultimate sacrifice to complete his part of the story of SAMCRO and fulfill his father's vision.\nSons of Anarchy is the story of the Teller-Morrow family of Charming, California, as well as the other members of Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO), their families, various Charming townspeople, allied and rival gangs, associates, and law agencies that undermine or support SAMCRO's legal and illegal enterprises.\nThe Sons of Anarchy (SOA) is an outlaw motorcycle club with many charters in the United States as well as overseas. The show focuses on the original and founding (\"mother\") charter, Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original,[12] referred to by the acronym SAMCRO[13] or Sam Crow, located in the fictional town of Charming, California, adjacent to the Teller-Morrow auto mechanic shop. Its nickname is reflected in the original title for the show, Forever Sam Crow.[14] Led by President Clay Morrow, the club 'protects' and controls Charming through close community relationships, bribery, and violent intimidation. In the early seasons they are vehement about keeping \"hard\" drugs and drug dealers out of Charming. They also do not tolerate sex criminals. The club's leadership are supporters of the IRA.\nJohn Teller and Piermont \"Piney\" Winston co-founded SAMCRO in 1967 on returning from the Vietnam War.[15] When John's wife Gemma becomes pregnant with their second son, Jackson (Jax), they settle in Gemma's hometown of Charming. Six of the \"Redwood Original 9\", or \"First 9\", members were Vietnam vets, with only Lenny Janowitz alive at the end of the series.\nClub members wear vests known as kuttes. The SOA patch on the back is a Grim Reaper holding a crystal ball with the Anarchist circle-A symbol, and wielding the Reaper's traditional scythe, the handle of which has been replaced by the M16 rifle that the founders wielded in Vietnam. Only full members can wear the \"patch\". Other smaller patches have specific meanings, such as \"Men of Mayhem\" worn by club members who have spilled blood on the club's behalf, \"First 9\", worn by the original nine members, and those for the President/Vice President/Sergeant at Arms/Secretary. Kelli Jones was the costume designer for all the seasons. Due to its popularity, replicas of the vests, with the same style of top pockets, zips and button clasps, have become popular on various auction sites.[citation needed]\nThe Sons ride customised Harley-Davidson Dyna motorcycles. Each rider customises his own bike to his individual style; however, they all paint their bikes black and most sport T-bar style handlebars. A patchholder's bike usually sports the Sons of Anarchy letters, the club's Grim Reaper logo, or the circled \"A\" club logo. In later seasons, several members switch to more touring-oriented models. For instance, Jax is often seen on a Street Glide. Prospects are not permitted to paint their bikes black until they get patched in.\nJax is also seen driving a silver Dodge Ram 1500 throughout the show. His mother (Gemma Teller Morrow) is usually seen driving a Cadillac XLR-V and an Escalade. Later in Season 6 she is seen driving a Lincoln Navigator (all are painted black).\nThroughout season 7 Jax is seen refurbishing his father's bike, a stock 1946 Harley Davidson, equipped with the correct Knucklehead motor and hardtail cradle frame. The bike which he rides in the Season 7 finale's last scenes is fitted with an Evolution motor, and late-model swing arm frame.\nThe Mayans MC also ride Harley Davidson motorcycles (Panheads, Shovelheads and Evolutions). The biggest difference between their bikes and the Sons' lies in ape hanger bars, fender skirts and bikes of all colors.\nNero Padilla errs when referring to the year of his blue Impala SS. While he mentions the \"lack of child safety features in 1964\", it is actually a 1963 Impala SS.\nSome members have day jobs in local industries; most work at the Teller-Morrow garage as mechanics, but they primarily make money by illegally importing weapons and selling them to various gangs, and making protection runs for local businesses by defending valuable truck shipments against hijacking. During Season 4 they start to mule cocaine for the Galindo cartel in exchange for cash and protection. In later seasons they manage a porn studio and an escort business, both legitimately.\nSAMCRO keeps meth traffickers and drug dealers out of Charming, which puts them at odds with the meth-distributing white supremacist Nordics (AKA Nords), headed by Ernest Darby. This earns them respect and admiration from the townspeople, who believe the Sons do more to protect their town than its own police. SAMCRO also has to deal with a rival, Oakland-based motorcycle club (MC), the Mayans led by Marcus Alvarez (played by Emilio Rivera, who also appeared in The Shield as Mexican drug dealer Navarro Quintero). Other groups in SAMCRO's orbit include the San Francisco\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbased Chinese mafia Lin Triad, led by Henry Lin; the Italian American Cacuzza crime family; the Russian mob led by Viktor Putlova; the Real IRA (aka RIRA) of Ireland, which supplies them with illegal Russian-made guns; the \"One-Niners\", an African American street gang (which also appeared on The Shield, thus possibly putting the two in the same fictional universe) to whom SAMCRO sell weapons; and various affiliates in the state prison system, where many members of the club have been incarcerated at one time or another. These gangs serve important roles in either being enemies of the clubs or soon to be partners with the MC to bring in more money.\nIn the series premiere, the Mayans torch the facility the SAMCRO used for storing and assembling guns, forcing the club to buy land for and build another facility. The clubhouse, described above, includes a living area with multiple rooms (where members sometimes crash for the night), a fully operational bar, a pool table, a kitchen, a workout room, and the \"chapel\", a room with an elaborate redwood conference table that has a reaper logo carved into the top, where the patched members meet to discuss club business and vote on major decisions. The club owns a secluded cabin in the woods and a warehouse outside of town (which was bought from but is still maintained by club associate Elliot Oswald), where they have stored weapons and cocaine for the Galindo Cartel. The club also rents an old soda fountain/candy shop that is used as the clubhouse in seasons 6 and 7 after the Teller/Morrow clubhouse was destroyed in an explosion. They also spend time at Red Woody, the club's porn studio (run by Lyla), and Diosa and Diosa Norte, the club's two escort agencies.\nSons of Anarchy has commonly been called \"Hamlet on Harleys\".[16] Similar to Hamlet, Jax's father was usurped by his father's SAMCRO \"brother\", who then married Jax's mother. There are also intermittent hints at an Oedipal complex between Jax and Gemma, reflecting 20th-century interpretations of the relationship between Hamlet and his mother Queen Gertrude. Jax's murder of the innocent Jury in season 7 mirrors Hamlet's murder of the innocent Polonius in that it ultimately leads to his downfall.\nSutter has said of the Shakespeare element, \"I don't want to overplay that but it's there. It was Jax's father who started the club, so he's the ghost in the action. You wonder what he would have made of the way it turned out. It's not a version of Hamlet but it's definitely influenced by it.\"[17] Ron Perlman believed they were \"going to stick to the structure of Hamlet all the way to the end (of the series).\"[18]\nNumerous episode titles refer to Hamlet including:\nIn the Season 1 premiere, Gemma is shown cleaning Jax's house, and he notes that she is always cleaning. This behavior, combined with her ambitions and (sometimes murderous) machinations, have prompted some reviewers and commentators to liken her to Lady Macbeth.[19][20]\nThe series was created by Kurt Sutter. Sutter was also the showrunner, the series' most prolific writer, and a regular director; he directed each season finale. Sutter had previously worked as an executive producer for the FX series The Shield. The Sons of Anarchy's' other executive producers are father and son team Art Linson and John Linson; Jim Parriott served as an executive producer and writer for the first season only.\nParis Barclay joined Sons of Anarchy as an executive producer in the fourth season, after directing episodes in the first and second season. In addition to serving as Executive Producer in the fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons, Barclay directed three episodes each season, including the season 4 and 5 premieres, the top two highest-rated telecasts in the history of FX.[5]\nJack LoGiudice served as a consulting producer and regular writer for the first season. He became co-executive producer for the second season, then left the series to work on The Walking Dead.\nDave Erickson also worked as a consulting producer for the first and second seasons, and then took over as co-executive producer for the third season. The series' other regular writers are supervising producer Chris Collins and co-producer Regina Corrado. Shawn Rutherford joined as consulting producer for seasons 6 and 7.\nSutter drew regular directors from The Shield including Stephen Kay, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Guy Ferland, and Billy Gierhart.\nAlthough Sons of Anarchy is set in Northern California's Central Valley (with some scenes in the Bay Area), it was filmed primarily at Occidental Studios Stage 5A in North Hollywood. Main sets located there included the clubhouse, St. Thomas Hospital, and Jax's house. The production rooms at the studio used by the writing staff doubled as the Charming police station. External scenes were often filmed nearby in Sun Valley, Acton, California, and Tujunga.[21] Interior and exterior scenes set in Northern Ireland during season 3 were also filmed at Occidental Studios and surrounding areas. A second unit shot footage in Northern Ireland used in the third season.[22]\nSons of Anarchy has received very favorable reviews over the course of its run, with many singling out Katey Sagal's performance. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 68/100, the second season scored 86/100, the third season scored 84/100, the fourth season scored 81/100, the fifth season scored 72/100 and the 6th season scored 74/100.[34][35][36][37]\nIn 2013, a collection of essays on the series was published.[38]\nThe first season received positive reviews from industry critics. It scored a 68 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the first season had \"real potential\".[39] The New York Times' Gina Bellafante spoke highly of the cast's acting ability, particularly Sagal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portrayal of Gemma. Brian Lowry of Variety gave a mixed review, admiring Sutter's creation of the club and the town of Charming but observing the early episodes lacked direction.[40]\nThe second season saw a substantial increase in positive reviews. Writing for Chicago Tribune, Maureen Ryan called the second season \"engrossing\". She elaborated that \"the pacing is better [and] the plotting is tighter\" and commends Sagal and Perlman for their performances.[41] Variety\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stuart Levine stated that the new season was \"compelling\"; he also complimented the acting skill of Perlman, Sagal, Hunnam and Siff.[42] James Poniewozik of TIME called Sagal's performance \"devastatingly powerful\" and named the series on his list of Top 10 Shows of 2009.[43]\nSome critics felt the third season was dragged down by the previous season's cliffhanger.[44][45] James Poniewozik of TIME called the season three premiere \"breathtaking\" and praised Sagal\u2019s performance with Holbrook.[46] He later stated that Abel's disappearance helped return the show to its central problem: Jax's allegiance to the club.[47] Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Ken Tucker agreed that Holbrook and Sagal\u2019s scenes were \"beautiful\". He also commented that the series handled themes of loyalty and family especially well.[48] Maureen Ryan commented that the third season divided critics and fans alike, suggesting the expanded Belfast cast made it harder for the audience to invest in the characters' journeys.[49] Ryan later questioned the credibility of Hector Salazar's story, noting that he was inferior to other villainous characters such as Stahl, Zobelle and Weston. However, she praised Ally Walker's performance, comparing her character to The Shield's Vic Mackey.[50] Critic Alan Sepinwall said the season was \"interesting but uneven\", noting that the plot gained traction in later episodes.[51][52] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said \"Sutter should be applauded for shaking things up\", calling the slower pace a \"creative necessity\".[53]\nAlan Sepinwall stated that the fourth season risked predictability by returning to a successful formula of storytelling, but he nonetheless preferred those episodes to those of season three.[54] Maureen Ryan reviewed the fourth season positively. She praised the addition of Lincoln Potter (played by Ray McKinnon), comparing the character's quality to that of Breaking Bad's antagonist, Gustavo Fring.[55] The A.V. Club called the fourth season more \"focused\" and \"operatic\". A.V. Club reviewer Zack Handlen was fond of the season but felt disappointed with the finale, saying it featured a \"lousy case of dictated convenience, of an arbitrary and unbelievable reveal used to shift characters around to where the writers want them to be for next season, as opposed to where they might land organically.\" However, the review did praise Charlie Hunnam's performance in the finale.[56][57] TIME said the fourth season was the strongest since season two, but the show needed to end sooner rather than later. TIME also agreed that the finale's contrivances were sometimes too visible, stating \"it's the principle: you can only turn up alive at your own funeral so many times before it starts to lose its impact.\"[58]\nSeason five received favorable reviews and has a rating of 72 on the review aggregator site Metacritic.[59] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the series by calling it a \"richly detailed portrait of self-righteous villainy\". The series had a rating of 8.6/10 on the review site IMDB.\nSeason six received generally favorable reviews and scored a 74 out of 100 on Metacritic.\nSeason seven received generally favorable reviews and scored a 68 out of 100 on Metacritic.\nThe seventh season's premiere on September 9, 2014 received the highest ratings in the series' history. The episode was watched by 6.20 million viewers.\nSons of Anarchy was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Drama at the 2010 TCA Awards.[73] Katey Sagal received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series (Drama) at the 68th Golden Globe Awards for her role in the third season.[73] She also received a nomination for a 2010 Satellite Award in the category of Best Actress \u2013 Television Series (Drama), as well as a TCA nomination for the Individual Achievement in Drama.[73] Sons of Anarchy (Season 5) received a Screen Crush Award for having the best TV series in 2012. Also in 2012, Paris Barclay was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Direction in a Drama Series for his direction of the Season 4 Premiere \"Out\". In 2013, Rockmond Dunbar won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Sheriff Eli Roosevelt. For the 5th Critics' Choice Television Awards, Charlie Hunnam received a nomination for Best Actor in a Drama Series and Walton Goggins received a nomination for Best Guest Performer in a Drama Series for the seventh season.[74]\nThree EP soundtracks have been released by 20th Century Fox Records, on iTunes, featuring songs from each series. The first five-song EP, entitled Sons of Anarchy: North Country \u2013 EP, was released on September 8, 2009 and featured the full version of the Emmy Award nominated[75] theme song \"This Life\".[76] A second five-song EP, entitled Sons of Anarchy: Shelter \u2013 EP, was released on November 24, 2009 while a third six-song EP, entitled Sons of Anarchy: The King is Gone - EP, was released on November 23, 2010.\nIn November 2011, selected highlights from the EPs and new tracks were released in Songs of Anarchy: Music from Sons of Anarchy Seasons 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4, followed up by Sons of Anarchy: Songs of Anarchy Vol. 2 released in November 2012, Sons of Anarchy: Songs of Anarchy Vol. 3 released in December 2013, and Sons of Anarchy: Songs of Anarchy Vol. 4 released in February 2015.\nIn 2013, Boom! Studios began publishing a Sons of Anarchy comic book. As of September 2015, 25 issues have been published.[77] Issue 25 is the final issue. A new comic book prequel, Sons of Anarchy: Redwood Original, was released on August 3, 2016.\nSons of Anarchy: Bratva, the first in a planned series of SOA novels to be written by Christopher Golden, was published in 2014.[78]\nA prequel series, detailing the origin of the club, is planned. Sutter stated in an August 2014 interview that the prequel would focus on the \"First 9\" members of the club and be set around the time of the Vietnam War. He added that the prequel would likely consist of a miniseries or \"maybe 10 episodes or two 8 episodes seasons\". At the conclusion of the prequel, Sutter plans to release John Teller's manuscript, titled The Life and Death of SAMCRO.[79]\nSons of Anarchy: The Prospect was an episodic adventure video game developed by Silverback Games and published by Orpheus Interactive.[80][81] The game was originally slated to have ten episodes and to be released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android.[82] The first episode was released on February 1, 2015 for iOS only, and was met with mixed reviews.[83] but has not seen an update since, and, although a season pass is being offered, no further episode was ever released.[84] On April 7, 2016, refunds were issued to everyone who purchased the game or the season pass, and the game had been removed from the App Store.[81]\nDespite the apparent cancellation and refunds, the game's publisher has not officially said anything about the development state of the nine unreleased episodes. Silverback Games has distanced themselves from the project, claiming to be \"just a consultant\" and having no knowledge of the state of the game or of Orpheus Interactive.[85]\nA Sons of Anarchy game was originally planned to be developed by a studio of Rockstar Games for PC and console platforms,[86] but was canceled shortly after in 2012.[87] Another video game based on Sons of Anarchy was announced in February 2014,[88] confirmed for mobile platforms in August,[89] and the name Sons of Anarchy: The Prospect revealed in December of that year.[90] The game was set to have never-before seen graphics for mobile devices,[91] but failed to deliver those when the first episode was launched on February 1, 2015.[92]\nAs of May 11, 2016, a spin-off series is in the works titled Mayans MC.[93] The pilot will begin shooting in March, directed by Sutter from a script he co-wrote with Elgin James.[94] On February 13, 2017, Edward James Olmos will star as Felipe Reyes, the once strong Mexican patriarch and EZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father.[95] On January 5, 2018, FX picked up the series with an order of 10 episodes which is set to premiere sometime in 2018.[96]\nSons of Anarchy premiered in Australia on the Showcase in 2009 while in New Zealand it appeared on TV3 on October 20, 2010 and it has been announced it is moving to the Box.

        "text": "The Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11 November 1942) was a battle of the Second World War that took place near the Egyptian railway halt of El Alamein. With the Allies victorious, it was the watershed of the Western Desert Campaign. The First Battle of El Alamein had prevented the Axis from advancing further into Egypt. In August 1942, Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery took command of the Eighth Army following the sacking of General Claude Auchinleck and the death of his replacement Lieutenant-General William Gott in an air crash.\nThe Allied victory turned the tide in the North African Campaign and ended the Axis threat to Egypt, the Suez Canal and the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields via North Africa. The Second Battle of El Alamein revived the morale of the Allies, being the first big success against the Axis since Operation Crusader in late 1941. The battle coincided with the Allied invasion of French North Africa in Operation Torch, which started on 8 November, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Guadalcanal Campaign.\nThe Panzer Army Africa (Panzerarmee Afrika), composed of German and Italian infantry and mechanised units under Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, had struck deep into Egypt by 12 July 1942 after its success at the Battle of Gazala. This threatened the British Empire's control of the Suez Canal and Mandatory Palestine. General Claude Auchinleck withdrew the Eighth Army to within 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi) of Alexandria to a point where the Qattara Depression came to within 64 kilometres (40\u00a0mi) of El Alamein on the coast. This gave the defenders a short front to defend and provided secure flanks because tanks could not traverse the Depression. The Axis advance was halted here in early July in the First Battle of El Alamein.\nThe Eighth Army counter-offensives during July failed, as Rommel had dug in to allow his exhausted troops to regroup. Auchinleck called off all offensive action at the end of July to allow rebuilding the Eighth Army's strength. In early August, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and General Sir Alan Brooke\u2014the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)\u2014visited Cairo and replaced Auchinleck as Commander-in-chief (C-in-C) Middle East Command with General Sir Harold Alexander. Lieutenant-General William Gott was appointed to command of the Eighth Army, but he was killed when the transport plane he was travelling in was shot down by Luftwaffe fighters; Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery was then appointed commander of the Eighth Army.\nFaced with long supply lines and lacking reinforcements, and well aware of massive Allied reinforcements in men and materiel on the way, Rommel decided to strike the Allies while their build-up was incomplete. The two armoured divisions of the Afrika Korps, together with a force made up of the reconnaissance units of Panzer Army Africa, led the attack but the Allies stopped them at the Alam el Halfa ridge and Point 102 on 30 August 1942. The attack failed in this second battle at the Alamein line, better known as the Battle of Alam el Halfa (commonly, but incorrectly, Alam Halfa); expecting a counter-attack by Montgomery's Eighth Army, Panzer Army Africa dug in.\nThe factors that had favoured the Eighth Army's defensive plan in the First Battle of El Alamein, the short front line and the secure flanks, now favoured the Axis defence. Rommel, furthermore, had plenty of time to prepare his defensive positions and lay extensive minefields (laying approximately 500,000 mines) and barbed wire.[15] Alexander and Montgomery were determined to establish a superiority of forces sufficient not only to achieve a breakthrough but also to exploit it and destroy Panzer Army Africa. In all the previous swings of the pendulum in the Western Desert Campaign since 1941, neither side had ever had the strength after achieving victory in an offensive battle to exploit it decisively: the losing side had always been able to withdraw and regroup closer to its main supply bases.\nThe British had an intelligence advantage: signals intelligence from Ultra and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position, force disposition and intentions. A reorganisation of the intelligence function in Africa in July had also improved the integration of intelligence received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination.[16] With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked.[17] By 25 October, Panzer Army fuel stocks were down to three days' supply, of which only two days' worth were east of Tobruk. \"The Panzer Army...\u00c2\u00a0did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day\".[18]\nSubmarine and air transport somewhat eased the shortage of ammunition and by late October, stocks amounting to 16 days supply were held in forward areas.[18] After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready, 195,000 men and 1,029 tanks began the offensive against the 116,000 men and 547 tanks of Panzer Army Africa.\nMontgomery's plan was for a main attack to the north of the line and a secondary attack to the south, involving XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese) and XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks), while X Corps (Lieutenant-General Herbert Lumsden) was to exploit the success.[19] With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery intended to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. One corridor was to run south-west through the 2nd New Zealand Division sector towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge, while the second was to run west, passing 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) north of the west end of the Miteirya Ridge across the 9th Australian and 51st (Highland) Division sectors.[20] Tanks would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and also the south of the line would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a 12-day battle in three stages: the break-in, the dogfight and the final breaking of the enemy.[21]\nFor the first night of the offensive, Montgomery planned for four infantry divisions of XXX Corps to advance on a 16\u00a0mi (26\u00a0km) front to the Oxalic Line, over-running the forward Axis defences. Engineers would clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields, through which the armoured divisions from X Corps would pass to gain the Pierson Line. They would rally and consolidate their position just west of the infantry positions, blocking an Axis tank counter-attack. The British tanks would then advance to Skinflint, astride the north\u2013south Rahman Track deep in the Axis defensive system, to challenge the Axis armour.[20] The infantry battle would continue as the Eighth Army infantry \"crumbled\" the deep Axis defensive fortifications (three successive lines of fortification had been constructed) and destroy any tanks that attacked them.[22][k]\nThe Commonwealth forces practised a number of deceptions in the months before the battle to confuse the Axis command as to the whereabouts of the forthcoming battle and when the battle was likely to occur. This operation was codenamed Operation Bertram. In September, they dumped waste materials (discarded packing cases, etc.) under camouflage nets in the northern sector, making them appear to be ammunition or ration dumps. The Axis naturally noticed these but, as no offensive action immediately followed and the \"dumps\" did not change in appearance, they were subsequently ignored. This allowed Eighth Army to build up supplies in the forward area unnoticed by the Axis, by replacing the rubbish with ammunition, petrol or rations at night. Meanwhile, a dummy pipeline was built, hopefully leading the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it, in fact, did and much further south. To further the illusion, dummy tanks consisting of plywood frames placed over jeeps were constructed and deployed in the south. In a reverse feint, the tanks destined for battle in the north were disguised as supply trucks by placing removable plywood superstructures over them.[24]\nAs a preliminary, the 131st (Queen's) Infantry Brigade of the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division, supported by tanks from the 4th Armoured Brigade, launched Operation Braganza attacking the 185th Airborne Division Folgore on the night of 29/30 September in an attempt to capture the Deir el Munassib area. The Italian paratroopers repelled the attack, killing or capturing over 300 of the attackers.[25] It was wrongly assumed that Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (German paratroopers) had manned the defences and been responsible for the British reverse. The Afrika Korps war diary notes that the Italian paratroops \"bore the brunt of the attack. It fought well and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.\"[26]\nWith the failure of their offensive at Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces were now on the defensive, but losses had not been excessive. German and Italian supply lines were over-stretched; the Axis had been relying on captured Allied supplies and equipment that had long since been consumed. Rommel had been advised by both the German and Italian staffs that his army could not be properly supplied so far from the ports of Tripoli and Benghazi. Despite these warnings, Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, the supply echelons could not deliver the required supplies from the ports to the front.[27] On the other hand, the British Commonwealth forces were being re-supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the newly-introduced Sherman tanks from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel, but the main focus of the German war machine was on the Eastern Front, and very limited supplies reached North Africa.\nFurthermore, Rommel was ill. In early September, arrangements were made for him to return to Germany on sick leave and for General der Panzertruppe Georg Stumme to transfer from the Russian front to take his place. Before he left for Germany on 23 September, Rommel organised the planned defence and wrote a long appreciation of the situation to the German High Command, once again setting out the essential needs of the Panzer Army.[28]\nRommel knew that the British Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to launch an offensive against his army. His only hope now relied on the German forces fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad to quickly defeat the Soviet forces and moving south through the Trans-Caucasus and threatening Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. This would require large numbers of British Commonwealth forces to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce British forces in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Using this delay, Rommel hoped to convince the German High Command to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between Panzer Army Africa and the German armies battling their way through southern Russia, enabling them finally to defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.\nIn the meantime, his forces dug in and waited for the eventual attack by the British Commonwealth forces or the defeat of the Soviet Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about 3.1\u00a0mi (5\u00a0km) apart which were connected at intervals to create boxes which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts and the rest of the box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire.[29] These became known as the Devil's gardens. The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least 2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) behind the second mine belt.[30] The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly Teller anti-tank mines with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the S-mine). (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians had a trick of dragging an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.[15]\nRommel was concerned with not letting the British armour break out into the open because he had neither the strength of numbers nor fuel to match them in a battle of manoeuvre. He therefore had to try to restrict the battle to his defended zones and counter any breakthrough both quickly and vigorously. Rommel therefore stiffened his forward lines by alternating German and Italian infantry formations. Because the Allied deception measures had confused the Axis as to their likely point of attack, Rommel departed from his usual practice of holding his armoured strength in a single concentrated reserve and split it into a northern group (15th Panzer and Littorio Division) and a southern group (21st Panzer and Ariete Division), each organised into battle groups in order to be able to make a quick armoured intervention wherever the blow fell and so prevent any narrow breakthroughs from being enlarged. The effect, however, was that a significant proportion of his armoured reserve was dispersed and held unusually far forward. The 15th Panzer Division had 125 operational tanks (16 Pz.IIs, 43 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 6 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F) while the 21st Panzer Division had 121 operational combat vehicles (12 Pz.IIs, 38 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 2 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F)[31] Further back, however, Rommel did have the 90th Light and Trieste Motorised Divisions in reserve near the coast.[32] Rommel believed that when the main thrust came, he could manoeuvre his troops faster than the Allies to concentrate his defences at the battle's centre of gravity. However, having concentrated his defence, he would not be able to move his forces again because of lack of fuel.[33]\nAs a result of their intelligence advantage, the British were well aware that Rommel would be unable to mount a defence based on his usual battle-of-manoeuvre tactics. However, no clear picture emerged of how he would fight the battle and, in the event, British plans seriously underestimated the Axis defences and the Panzer Army's power of resistance.[34]\nThe Battle of El Alamein is usually divided into five phases, consisting of the break-in (23\u201324 October), the crumbling (24\u201325 October), the counter (26\u201328 October), Operation Supercharge (1\u20132 November) and the break-out (3\u20137 November). No name is given to the period from 29\u201331 October, when the battle was at a standstill.\nPrior to the main barrage, there was a diversion by the 24th Australian Brigade, which involved the 15th Panzer Division being subjected to heavy fire for a few minutes.[35] Then at 21:40 (Egyptian Summer Time) on 23 October[36] on a calm, clear evening under the bright sky of a full moon, Operation Lightfoot began with a 1,000-gun barrage. The fire plan had been arranged so that the first rounds from the 882 guns from the field and medium batteries would land along the 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) front at the same time.[37] After 20 minutes of general bombardment, the guns switched to precision targets in support of the advancing infantry.[38] The shelling plan continued for five and a half hours, by the end of which each gun had fired about 600 rounds, about 529,000 shells.\nOperation Lightfoot alluded to the infantry attacking first. Anti-tank mines would not be tripped by soldiers stepping on them since they were too light. As the infantry advanced, engineers had to clear a path for the tanks coming behind. Each gap was to be 24\u00a0ft (7.3\u00a0m) wide, which was just enough to get tanks through in single file. The engineers had to clear a 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) route through the Devil's Gardens. It was a difficult task that was not achieved because of the depth of the Axis minefields.\nAt 22:00, the four infantry divisions of XXX Corps began to move. The objective was to establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, on the far side of the second mine belt. Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and sappers, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.[39]\nThe 7th Armoured Division (with one Free French Brigade under command) from XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) made a secondary attack to the south. The main attack aimed to achieve a breakthrough, engage and pin down the 21st Panzer Division and the Ariete Armoured Division around Jebel Kalakh, while the Free French on the far left were to secure Qaret el Himeimat and the el Taqa plateau.[20] The right flank of the attack was to be protected by 44th Infantry Division with the 131st Infantry Brigade. The attack met determined resistance, mainly from the 185 Airborne Division Folgore, part of the Ramcke Parachute Brigade and the Keil Group.[40][41] The minefields were deeper than anticipated and clearing paths through them was impeded by Axis defensive fire. By dawn on 24 October, paths still had not been cleared through the second minefield to release 22nd and 4th Light Armoured Brigades into the open to make their planned turn north into the rear of enemy positions 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) west of Deir el Munassib.[20]\nFurther north along the XIII Corps front, the 50th Infantry Division achieved a limited and costly success against determined resistance from the Pavia Division, Brescia Division and elements of the 185th Airborne Division Folgore.[42] The 4th Indian Infantry Division, on the far left of the XXX Corps front at Ruweisat Ridge, made a mock attack and two small raids intended to deflect attention to the centre of the front.[43]\nDawn aerial reconnaissance showed little change in Axis disposition, so Montgomery gave his orders for the day: the clearance of the northern corridor should be completed and the New Zealand Division supported by 10th Armoured should push south from Miteirya Ridge. 9th Australian Division, in the north, should plan a crumbling operation for that night, while in the southern sector, 7th Armoured should continue to try to break through the minefields with support, if necessary, from 44th Division.[44] Panzer units counter-attacked the 51st Highland Division just after sunrise, only to be stopped in their tracks.\nThe morning of Saturday 24 October brought disaster for the German headquarters. The reports that Stumme had received that morning showed the attacks had been on a broad front but that such penetration as had occurred should be containable by local units. He went forward himself to observe the state of affairs and, finding himself under fire, suffered a heart attack and died. Temporary command was given to Major-General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma. Hitler had already decided that Rommel should leave his sanatorium and return to North Africa. Rommel flew to Rome early on 25 October to press the Comando Supremo for more fuel and ammunition and then on to North Africa to resume command that night of the Panzer Army Africa, which that day was renamed the German-Italian Panzer Army (Deutsch-Italienische Panzerarmee).[45]\nThere was little activity during the day pending more complete clearance of paths through the minefields. The armour was held at Oxalic.[21] Artillery and the Allied Desert Air Force, making over 1,000 sorties,[44] attacked Axis positions all day to aid the 'crumbling' of the Axis forces. By 16:00 there was little progress.\nAt dusk, with the sun at their backs, Axis tanks from the 15th Panzer Division and Italian Littorio Division swung out from the Kidney feature (also known to the Germans and Italians as Hill 28), often wrongly called a ridge as it was actually a depression, to engage the 1st Armoured Division and the first major tank battle of El Alamein began. Over 100 tanks were involved and half were destroyed by dark. Neither position was altered.[citation needed]\nAt around 10:00, Axis aircraft had destroyed a convoy of 25 Allied vehicles carrying petrol and ammunition, setting off a night-long blaze; Lumsden wanted to call off the attack, but Montgomery made it clear that his plans were to be carried out.[46] The thrust that night by 10th Armoured Division from Miteirya Ridge failed. The lifting of mines on the Miteirya Ridge and beyond took far longer than planned and the leading unit, 8th Armoured Brigade, was caught on their start line at 22:00\u2014zero hour\u2014by an air attack and were scattered. By the time they had reorganised they were well behind schedule and out of touch with the creeping artillery barrage. By daylight the brigade was out in the open taking considerable fire from well sited tanks and anti-tank guns. Meanwhile 24th Armoured Brigade had pushed forward and reported at dawn they were on the Pierson line, although it turned out that, in the dust and confusion, they had mistaken their position and were well short.[47]\nThe attack in the XIII Corps sector to the south fared no better. 44th Division's 131st Infantry Brigade cleared a path through the mines, but when 22nd Armoured Brigade passed through, they came under heavy fire and were repulsed, with 31 tanks disabled. Allied air activity that night focused on Rommel's northern armoured group, where 135 short tons (122\u00c2\u00a0t) of bombs were dropped. To prevent a recurrence of 8th Armoured Brigade's experience from the air, attacks on Axis landing fields were also stepped up.[47]\nThe initial thrust had ended by Sunday. The Allies had advanced through the minefields in the west to make a 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) wide and 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km) deep inroad. They now sat atop Miteirya Ridge in the south-east. Axis forces were firmly entrenched in most of their original battle positions and the battle was at a standstill. Montgomery decided that the planned advance southward from Miteirya Ridge by the New Zealanders would be too costly and instead decided that XXX Corps\u2014while keeping firm hold of Miteirya\u2014should strike northward toward the coast with 9th Australian Division. Meanwhile, 1st Armoured Division\u2014on the Australians' left\u2014should continue to attack west and north-west, and activity to the south on both Corps fronts would be confined to patrolling.[48] The battle would be concentrated at the Kidney feature and Tel el Eisa until a breakthrough occurred.\nBy early morning, the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and Littorio divisions. The Panzer Army was probing for a weakness, but without success. When the sun set the Allied infantry went on the attack. Around midnight, 51st Division launched three attacks, but no one knew exactly where they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting in the loss of over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces.[citation needed]\nWhile the 51st Highland Division was operating around Kidney, the Australians were attacking Point 29,[l] a 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m) high Axis artillery observation post south-west of Tel el Eisa, in an attempt to surround the Axis coastal salient containing the German 164th Light Division and large numbers of Italian infantry.[50] This was the new northern thrust Montgomery had devised earlier in the day, and was to be the scene of heated battle for some days. The Australian 26th Brigade attacked at midnight, supported by artillery and 30 tanks of 40th Royal Tank Regiment.[51] They took the position and 240 prisoners. Fighting continued in this area for the next week, as the Axis tried to recover the small hill that was so important to their defence.\nMeanwhile, the air force night bombers dropped 115 short tons (104\u00a0t)[clarification needed] of bombs on targets in the battlefield and 14 short tons (13\u00a0t) on the Stuka base at Sidi Haneish, while night fighters flew patrols over the battle area and the Axis forward landing grounds.[51] In the south, the 4th Armoured Brigade and 69th Infantry Brigade attacked the Folgore (187th regiment) at Deir Munassib, but lost about 20 tanks gaining only the forward positions.[52][53]\nRommel, on his return to North Africa on the evening of 25 October, immediately assessed the battle. Casualties, particularly in the north, as a result of incessant artillery and air attack, had been heavy. He found that the Italian Trento Division had lost 50% of its infantry and most of its artillery, 164th Light Division had lost two battalions and although the 15th Panzer and Littorio Divisions had held off the Allied armour, this had proved costly;[45] 15th Panzer had a mere 31 tanks remaining.[54] Most other units were under strength, all men were on half rations, a large number were sick, and the entire Axis army had only enough fuel for three days.[18]\nRommel was convinced by this time that the main assault would come in the north[55] and determined to retake Point 29. He ordered a counter-attack against it by 15th Panzer, 164th Light Divisions and elements of Italian XX Corps to begin at 15:00 but (according to the British official history) under heavy artillery and air attack this came to nothing.[56] According to Rommel this attack did meet some success, with the Italians recapturing part of what he calls Hill 28: \"Attacks were now launched on Hill 28 by elements of the 15th Panzer Division, the Littorio and a Bersaglieri Battalion, supported by the concentrated fire of all the local artillery and AA. In the evening part of the Bersaglieri Battalion succeeded in occupying the eastern and western edges of the hill\".[57]\nThe bulk of the Australian 2/17th Battalion, which had defended the position, was in fact forced to pull back.[58] During the day, Rommel reversed his policy of distributing his armour across the front, ordering 90th Light Division forward from Ed Daba and 21st Panzer north along with one third of the Ariete Division and half the artillery from the southern sector to concentrate with 15th Panzer and Littorio in the north[59] at what was becoming the focal point of the battle. The Trieste Division were ordered from Fuka to replace 90th Light at Ed Daba. 21st Panzer and the Ariete made slow progress during the night as they were heavily bombed.[60] Rommel was aware that having moved 21st Panzer north he would be unable to move it back south because of a lack of fuel.[59]\nBack at the Kidney feature, the British failed to take advantage of the missing tanks. Each time they tried to move forward they were stopped by anti-tank guns. The Allied offensive was stalled. Churchill railed, \"Is it really impossible to find a general who can win a battle?\"[61]\nOn a brighter note for the British, three Vickers Wellington torpedo night bombers of No.38 Squadron destroyed the oil tanker Tergestea at Tobruk[62] and Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers of No. 42 Squadron RAF, attached to No. 47 Squadron, sank the tanker Proserpina at Tobruk, removing the last hope for refuelling Rommel's army. Rommel himself noted in his diary that with the sinking of Tergestea and Proserpina the battle was lost.[citation needed]\nMontgomery was concerned that the impetus of the offensive was waning. Although by 26 October XXX Corps' infantry had completed the capture of the planned bridgehead west of the second mine belt, the armour of X Corps, although established just beyond the infantry, had failed to break through the enemy's anti-tank defences.[39] He therefore decided that over the next two days, while continuing the process of attrition, he would thin out his front line to create a reserve with which to restore his momentum. The reserve was to include the New Zealand Division (with 9th Armoured Brigade under command), 10th Armoured Division and 7th Armoured Division.[63] The attacks in the south, which lasted three days and caused considerable losses without achieving a breakthrough, were suspended.\nBy this time, the main battle was concentrated around Tel el Aqqaqir and the Kidney feature at the end of 1st Armoured Division's path through the minefield. A mile north-west of the feature was Outpost Woodcock and roughly the same distance south-west lay Outpost Snipe. An attack was planned on these areas using two battalions from 7th Motor Brigade. At 23:00 on 26 October 2 Battalion, The Rifle Brigade would attack Snipe and 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) would attack Woodcock. The plan was for 2nd Armoured Brigade to pass round the north of Woodcock the following dawn and 24th Armoured Brigade round the south of Snipe. The attack was to be supported by all the available artillery of both X and XXX Corps.[64]\nBoth battalions had difficulty finding their way in the dark and dust. At dawn, the KRRC had not reached its objective and had to find cover and dig in some distance from Woodcock. 2nd Rifle Brigade had had better fortune and after following the shell bursts of the supporting artillery dug in when they concluded they had reached their objective having encountered little opposition.[65]\nAt 06:00, the 2nd Armoured Brigade commenced its advance and ran into such stiff opposition that, by noon, it had still not linked with the KRRC. The 24th Armoured Brigade started a little later and was soon in contact with the Rifle Brigade (having shelled them in error for a while). Some hours of confused fighting ensued involving tanks from the Littorio and troops and anti-tank guns from 15th Panzer which managed to keep the British armour at bay in spite of the support of the Rifle Brigade battlegroup's anti-tank guns. Rommel had decided to make two counter-attacks using his fresh troops. 90th Light Division was to make a fresh attempt to capture Point 29 and 21st Panzer were targeted at Snipe (the Ariete detachment had returned south).[66]\nAt Snipe, mortar and shellfire was constant all day long. At 16:00, Rommel launched his major attack. German and Italian tanks moved forward. Against them the Rifle Brigade had 13 6-pounder anti-tank guns along with six more from the supporting 239th Anti-Tank Battery, RA. Although on the point of being overrun more than once they held their ground, destroying 22 German and 10 Italian tanks. The Germans gave up but in error the British battle group was withdrawn without being replaced that evening. Its CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Buller Turner was awarded the Victoria Cross.[67] Only one anti-tank gun\u2014from 239 Battery\u2014was brought back.[68]\nWhen it was discovered that neither Woodcock nor Snipe was in Eighth Army hands, 133rd Lorried Infantry Brigade was sent to capture them. By 01:30 on 28 October, the 4th battalion Royal Sussex Regiment judged they were on Woodcock and dug in. At dawn, 2nd Armoured Brigade moved up in support but before contact could be made 4th Royal Sussex were counter-attacked and overrun with many losses. Meanwhile, the Lorried Brigade's two other battalions had moved on Snipe and dug in, only to find out the next day that they were in fact well short of their objective.[69]\nFurther north, the 90th Light Division's attack on Point 29 during the afternoon of 27 October failed under heavy artillery and bombing which broke up the attack before it had closed with the Australians. The action at Snipe was an episode of the Battle of El Alamein described by the regiment's historian as the most famous day of the regiment's war.[70] Lucas-Phillips, in his Alamein records that:\nThe desert was quivering with heat. The gun detachments and the platoons squatted in their pits and trenches, the sweat running in rivers down their dust-caked faces. There was a terrible stench. The flies swarmed in black clouds upon the dead bodies and excreta and tormented the wounded. The place was strewn with burning tanks and carriers, wrecked guns and vehicles, and over all drifted the smoke and the dust from bursting high explosives and from the blasts of guns.\nOn 28 October, 15th and 21st Panzer made a determined attack on the X Corps front but were halted by sustained artillery, tank and anti-tank gun fire. In the afternoon, they paused to regroup to attack again but they were bombed for two and a half hours and were prevented from even forming up.[71] This proved to be Rommel's last attempt to take the initiative and as such his defeat here represented a turning point in the battle.[72]\nAt this point, Montgomery ordered the X Corps formations in the Woodcock-Snipe area to go over to defence while he focused his army's attack further to the north. Late on 27 October, the British 133rd Brigade was sent forward to recover lost positions but the next day, a good part of this force was overrun by German and Italian tanks from the Littorio and supporting 12th Bersaglieri Regiment and several hundred British soldiers were captured.[73] On the night of 28/29 October, the 9th Australian Division was ordered to make a second set-piece attack. The 20th Australian Infantry Brigade with 40th R.T.R. in support would push north-west from Point 29 to form a base for 26th Australian Infantry Brigade with 46th R.T.R. in support, to attack north-east to an Axis location south of the railway known as Thompson's Post and then over the railway to the coast road, where they would advance south-east to close on the rear of the Axis troops in the coastal salient. An attack by the third brigade would then be launched on the salient from the south-east.[74]\nThe 20th Brigade took its objectives with little trouble but 26th Brigade had more trouble. Because of the distances involved, the troops were riding on 46th R.T.R. Valentine tanks as well as carriers, which mines and anti-tank guns soon brought to grief, forcing the infantry to dismount. The infantry and tanks lost touch with each other in fighting with the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment and a battalion of 7th Bersaglieri Regiment sent to reinforce the sector and the advance came to a halt.[74] The Australians suffered 200 casualties in that attack and suffered 27 killed and 290 wounded.[75] The German and Italian forces that had participated in the counter-attack formed an outpost and held on until the arrival of German reinforcements on 1 November.\nIt became clear that there were no longer enough hours of darkness left to reform, continue the attack and see it to its conclusion, so the operation was called off. By the end of these engagements in late October, the British had 800 tanks still in operation, while the Panzerarmee day report for 28 October (intercepted and read by Eighth Army the following evening) recorded 81 serviceable German tanks and 197 Italian.[72] With the help of signals intelligence information the Proserpina (carrying 4,500 tonnes of fuel) and Tergestea (carrying 1,000 tonnes of fuel and 1,000 tonnes of ammunition) had been destroyed on 26 October and the tanker Luisiano (carrying 2,500 tonnes of fuel) had been sunk off the west coast of Greece by a torpedo from a Wellington bomber on 28 October.[76] Rommel told his commanders, \"It will be quite impossible for us to disengage from the enemy. There is no gasoline for such a manoeuvre. We have only one choice and that is to fight to the end at Alamein.\"[77]\nThese actions by the Australians and British had alerted Montgomery that Rommel had committed his reserve in the form of 90th Light Division to the front and that its presence in the coastal sector suggested that Rommel was expecting the next major Eighth Army offensive in this sector. Montgomery determined therefore that it would take place further south on a 4,000\u00a0yd (2.3\u00a0mi; 3.7\u00a0km) front south of Point 29. The attack was to take place on the night of 31 October/1 November, as soon as he had completed the reorganisation of his front line to create the reserves needed for the offensive (although in the event it was postponed by 24 hours). To keep Rommel's attention on the coastal sector, Montgomery ordered the renewal of the 9th Australian Division operation on the night of 30/31 October.[78]\nThe night of 30 October saw a continuation of previous Australian plans, their third attempt to reach the paved road. Although not all the objectives were achieved, by the end of the night they were astride the road and the railway, making the position of the Axis troops in the salient precarious. Rommel brought up a battlegroup from 21. Panzer-Division and on 31 October, launched four successive attacks against \"Thompson's Post\". The fighting was intense and often hand-to-hand, but no ground was gained by the Axis forces. One of the Australians killed was Sergeant William Kibby (2/48th Infantry Battalion) who, for his heroic actions from the 23rd until his death on the 31st \u2013 including a lone attack on a machine-gun position at his own initiative \u2013 was awarded the Victoria Cross.[79]\nAgain, on Sunday, 1 November Rommel tried to dislodge the Australians, but the brutal, desperate fighting resulted in nothing but lost men and equipment. He did however regain contact with Panzergrenadier-Regiment 125 in the nose of the salient,[80] and the supporting 10\u00b0 battaglione Bersaglieri \u2013 that fought well according to German and Allied sources; the Bersaglieri had resisted several Australian attacks even though they were (in the words of military historian Niall Barr) \"surrounded on all sides, short of ammunition, food and water, [and] unable to evacuate their many wounded\".[81]\nBy now, it had become obvious to Rommel that the battle was lost. His fuel state continued to be critical: on 1 November, two more supply ships\u2014the Tripolino and the Ostia\u2014had been torpedoed and sunk from the air north-west of Tobruk. The shortage forced him to rely increasingly on fuel flown in from Crete on the orders of Albert Kesselring, Luftwaffe Oberbefehlshaber S\u00fcd (OB S\u00fcd, Supreme Commander South), despite the restrictions imposed by heavy bombing of the airfields in Crete and the Desert Air Force's efforts to intercept the transport aircraft.[82]\nRommel began to plan a retreat anticipating retiring to Fuka, some 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) west, as he had only 90 tanks remaining in stark contrast with the Allies' 800.[54] Ironically, large amounts of fuel arrived at Benghazi after the German forces had started to retreat, but little of it reached the front, a fact Kesselring tried to change by delivering it more closely to the fighting forces.[83]\nThis phase of the battle began at 01:00 on 2 November, with the objective of destroying enemy armour, forcing the enemy to fight in the open, reducing the Axis stock of petrol, attacking and occupying enemy supply routes, and causing the disintegration of the enemy army. The intensity and the destruction in Supercharge were greater than anything witnessed so far during this battle. The objective of this operation was Tel el Aqqaqir, the base of the Axis defence roughly 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) north-west of the Kidney feature and situated on the Rahman lateral track.[84]\nThe initial thrust of Supercharge was to be carried out by 2nd New Zealand Division. The division's commander \u2014 Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg \u2014 had tried to free them of this task, as they had lost 1,405 men in just three days, at El Ruweisat Ridge in July. However, in addition to its own 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and 28th (Maori) Infantry Battalion, the division was to have had placed under its command 151st (Durham) Brigade from 50th Division, 152nd (Seaforth and Camerons) Brigade from 51st Division and the 133rd Royal Sussex Lorried Infantry Brigade. In addition, the division was to have British 9th Armoured Brigade under command.[85]\nAs in Operation Lightfoot, it was planned that two infantry brigades (the 151st on the right and 152nd on the left) each this time supported by a regiment of tanks\u2014the 8th and 50th Royal Tank Regiments\u2014would advance and clear a path through the mines. Once they reached their objectives, 4,000\u00a0yd (3,700\u00a0m) distant, 9th Armoured Brigade would pass through supported by a heavy artillery barrage and break open a gap in the Axis defences on and around the Rahman track, some 2,000\u00a0yd (1,800\u00a0m) further forward, which the 1st Armoured Division, following behind, would pass through into the open to take on Rommel's armoured reserves.[86] Rommel had ordered 21st Panzer Division from the front line on 31 October to form a mobile counterattacking force. The division had left behind a panzergrenadier regiment which would bolster the Trieste Division which had been ordered forward to replace it. Rommel had also interspersed formations from the Trieste and 15th Panzer Divisions to \"corset\" his weaker forces in the front line. On 1 November the two German armoured divisions had 102 effective tanks to face Supercharge and the Littorio and Trieste Divisions had 65 tanks between them.[87]\nSupercharge started with a seven-hour aerial bombardment focused on Tel el Aqqaqir and Sidi Abd el Rahman, followed by a four and a half hour barrage of 360 guns firing 15,000 shells.[citation needed] The two assault brigades started their attack at 01:05 on 2 November and gained most of their objectives to schedule and with moderate losses. On the right of the main attack 28th (Maori) battalion captured positions to protect the right flank of the newly formed salient and 133rd Lorried Infantry did the same on the left. New Zealand engineers cleared five lines through the mines allowing the Royal Dragoons armoured car regiment to slip out into the open and spend the day raiding the Axis communications.[88]\nThe 9th Armoured Brigade had started its approach march at 20:00 on 1 November from El Alamein railway station with around 130 tanks and arrived at its start line with only 94 runners (operational tanks). The brigade was to have started its attack towards Tel el Aqqaqir at 05:45 behind a barrage; the attack was postponed for 30 minutes while the brigade regrouped on Currie's orders.[89] At 06:15, 30 minutes before dawn, the three regiments of the brigade advanced towards the gun line.[90]\nWe all realise that for armour to attack a wall of guns sounds like another Balaclava, it is properly an infantry job. But there are no more infantry available. So our armour must do it.\nBrigadier Currie had tried to get the brigade out of doing this job, stating that he believed the brigade would be attacking on too wide a front with no reserves and that they would most likely have 50 percent losses.[91]\nThe reply came from Freyberg that Montgomery\n...\u00c2\u00a0was aware of the risk and has accepted the possibility of losing 100% casualties in 9th Armoured Brigade to make the break, but in view of the promise of immediate following through of the 1st Armoured Division, the risk was not considered as great as all that.\nThe German and Italian anti-tank guns (mostly Pak38 and Italian 47 mm guns, along with 24 of the formidable 88 mm flak guns) opened fire upon the charging tanks silhouetted by the rising sun.[92][91] German tanks, which had penetrated between the Warwickshire Yeomanry and Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, also caused many casualties. British tanks attacking the Folgore sector were fought off with petrol bombs and mortar fire as well as with the obsolete Italian 47\u00c2\u00a0mm cannons. The Axis gun screen started to inflict a steady amount of damage upon the advancing tanks but was unable to stop them; over the course of the next 30 minutes, around 35 guns were destroyed and several hundred prisoners taken. The 9th Armoured Brigade had started the attack with 94 tanks and was reduced to only 14 operational tanks[93] and of the 400 tank crew involved in the attack, 230 were killed, wounded or captured.[94]\nBernard Montgomery, referring to the British Armour's mistakes during the First Battle of El Alamein[citation needed]\nAfter the Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, \"Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to know where your tanks are?\" Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him and replied \"There they are\". Gentry said \"I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?\" Currie waved his arm and again replied, \"There are my armoured regiments, Bill\".[96]\nThe brigade had sacrificed itself upon the gun line and caused great damage but had failed to create the gap for the 1st Armoured Division to pass through; however, soon after dawn 1st Armoured Division started to deploy and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade came under its command. 2nd Armoured Brigade came up behind the 9th, and by mid-morning 8th Armoured Brigade had come up on its left, ordered to advance to the south-west.[93] In heavy fighting during the day the British armour made little further progress. At 11:00 on 2 November, the remains of 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer and Littorio Armoured Divisions counter-attacked 1st Armoured Division and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade, which by that time had dug in with a screen of anti-tank guns and artillery together with intensive air support. The counter-attack failed under a blanket of shells and bombs, resulting in a loss of some 100 tanks.[94]\nAlthough X Corps had failed in its attempt to break out, it had succeeded in its objective of finding and destroying enemy tanks. Although tank losses were approximately equal, this represented only a portion of the total British armour, but most of Rommel's tanks; the Afrika Korps strength of tanks fit for battle fell by 70 while in addition to the losses of the 9th Armoured Brigade, the 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades lost 14 tanks in the fighting, with another 40 damaged or broken down. The fighting was later termed the \"Hammering of the Panzers\". In the late afternoon and early evening, the 133rd Lorried and 151st Infantry Brigades\u2014by this time back under command of 51st Infantry Division\u2014attacked respectively the Snipe and Skinflint (about a mile west of Snipe) positions in order to form a base for future operations. The heavy artillery concentration which accompanied their advance suppressed the opposition from the Trieste Division and the operation succeeded with few casualties.[97]\nOn the night of 2 November, Montgomery once again reshuffled his infantry in order to bring four brigades (5th Indian, 151st, 5th New Zealand and 154th) into reserve under XXX Corps to prepare for the next thrust. He also reinforced X Corps by moving 7th Armoured Division from army reserve and sending 4th Light Armoured Brigade from XIII Corps in the south. General von Thoma's report to Rommel that night said he would have at most 35 tanks available to fight the next day and his artillery and anti-tank weapons had been reduced to \u2153 of their strength at the start of the battle. Rommel concluded that to forestall a breakthrough and the resulting destruction of his whole army he must start withdrawing to the planned position at Fuka. He called up Ariete from the south to join the mobile Italian XX Corps around Tel el Aqqaqir. His mobile forces (XX Corps, Afrika Korps, 90th Light Division and 19th Flak Division) were ordered to make a fighting withdrawal while his other formations were to withdraw as best they could with the limited transport available.[98]\nAt 20:30 on 2 November, Lumsden decided that one more effort by his X Corps would see the gun screen on the Rahman track defeated and ordered 7th Motor Brigade to seize the track along a 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) front north of Tell el Aqqaqir. The 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades would then pass through the infantry to a distance of about 3.5\u00a0mi (5.6\u00a0km). On the morning of 3 November 7 Armoured Division would pass through and swing north heading for the railway at Ghazal station. 7th Motor Brigade set off at 01:15 on 3 November, but having received its orders late, had not had the chance to reconnoitre the battle area in daylight. This combined with stiff resistance led to the failure of their attack. As a consequence, the orders for the armour were changed and 2nd Armoured Brigade was tasked to support the forward battalion of 133rd Lorried Brigade (2nd King's Royal Rifle Corps) and 8th Armoured Brigade was to push south-west. Fighting continued throughout 3 November, but 2nd Armoured was held by elements of the Afrika Korps and tanks of the Littorio Division. Further south, 8th Armoured Brigade was held off by anti-tank units helped later by tanks of the arriving Ariete Division.[99]\nOn 2 November, Rommel let Hitler know that: \"The army's strength was so exhausted after its ten days of battle that it was not now capable of offering any effective opposition to the enemy's next break-through attempt\u00a0... With our great shortage of vehicles an orderly withdrawal of the non-motorised forces appeared impossible\u00a0... In these circumstances we had to reckon, at the least, with the gradual destruction of the army.\"[100] At 13.30 on 3 November Rommel received a reply:\n\"To Field Marshal Rommel. It is with trusting confidence in your leadership and the courage of the German-Italian troops under your command that the German people and I are following the heroic struggle in Egypt. In the situation which you find yourself there can be no other thought but to stand fast, yield not a yard of ground and throw every gun and every man into the battle. Considerable air force reinforcements are being sent to C.-in-C South. The Duce and the Comando Supremo are also making the utmost efforts to send you the means to continue the fight. Your enemy, despite his superiority, must also be at the end of his strength. It would not be the first time in history that a strong will has triumphed over the bigger battalions. As to your troops, you can show them no other road than that to victory or death. Adolf Hitler\".[101]\nRommel thought the order (similar to one that had been given at the same time by Benito Mussolini through the Comando Supremo) \"demanded the impossible.\u00c2\u00a0... We were completely stunned, and for the first time in the African campaign I did not know what to do. A kind of apathy took hold of us as we issued orders for all existing positions to be held on instructions from the highest authority.\"[101]\nRommel decided to compromise: X and XXI Italian Corps and 90th Light Division would stand firm while the Afrika Korps would withdraw approximately 6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) west during the night of 3 November with XX Italian Corps and the Ariete Division conforming to their position. He then replied to Hitler confirming his determination to hold the battlefield. The Desert Air Force continued to apply huge pressure. In what was its biggest day of the battle, it flew 1,208 sorties and dropped 396 short tons (359\u00a0t) of bombs in the 24 hours of 3 November.[102]\nOn the night of 3 November, Montgomery launched at the Rahman track three of the infantry brigades he had gathered into reserve as a prelude to a massive armoured break out. At 17:45, 152nd Infantry Brigade\u2014with 8th RTR in support\u2014attacked about 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km) south of Tel el Aqqaqir. 5th Indian Infantry Brigade would attack the track 4\u00a0mi (6.4\u00a0km) south during the early hours of 4 November, and at 06:15, 154th Infantry Brigade would attack Tel el Aqqaqir. The first of these attacks\u2014having been mistakenly told the enemy had withdrawn from their objectives\u2014met stiff resistance. Failed communications compounded problems and the forward infantry elements ended up dug in well short of their objective. By the time 5th Indian Brigade set off, the defenders had started to withdraw and their objective was taken with virtually no opposition. By the time 154th Brigade moved forward, although they met some shelling, the enemy had left.[103]\nOn 4 November, Eighth Army's plan for pursuit was set in motion at dawn. There were no fresh units available for the chase so 1st and 7th Armoured Division were to swing northward to roll up the Axis units still in the forward lines and 2nd New Zealand Division with two lorry borne infantry brigades and 9th Armoured and 4th Light Armoured Brigades under command would head west along desert tracks to the escarpment above Fuka, some 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) away. The New Zealanders got off to a bad start because the units involved were dispersed after the recent fighting and took time to concentrate. The paths through the minefields were very congested and broken up, which delayed matters further. By dark, Freyberg had leaguered his force only 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) west of the Rahman track, although 9th Armoured Brigade was still at the track and 6th New Zealand Brigade even further back.[104]\n1st and 7th Armoured Divisions' plan to trap 90th Light Division also hit trouble. The 1st Armoured came into contact with the remnants of 21st Panzer and had to spend most of the day pushing them back 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km). Meanwhile, 7th Armoured was being held up by the Ariete Armoured Division which in the course of the day was decimated while giving stout resistance.[105] This action is described by Rommel in his diary:\nEnormous dust-clouds could be seen south and south-east of headquarters [of the DAK], where the desperate struggle of the small and inefficient Italian tanks of XX Corps was being played out against the hundred or so British heavy tanks which had come round their open right flank. I was later told by Major von Luck, whose battalion I had sent to close the gap between the Italians and the Afrika Korps, that the Italians, who at that time represented our strongest motorised force, fought with exemplary courage. Tank after tank split asunder or burned out, while all the time a tremendous British barrage lay over the Italian infantry and artillery positions. The last signal came from the Ariete at about 15.30 hours: \"Enemy tanks penetrated south of Ariete. Ariete now encircled. Location 5 km north-west Bir el Abd. Ariete tanks still in action.\" [...] In the Ariete we lost our oldest Italian comrades, from whom we had probably always demanded more than they, with their poor armament, had been capable of performing.[106][m]\nThis day also saw the destruction of the Littorio Armoured Division and the Trieste Motorised Division. Berlin radio claimed that in this sector the \"British were made to pay for their penetration with enormous losses in men and material. The Italians fought to the last man.\"[108] The British, however, took many prisoners, since the remnants of Italian infantry divisions were not motorised and could not escape from encirclement. Private Sid Martindale, 1st Battalion Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders, wrote about the \"Bologna\" Division, which had taken the full weight of the British armoured attack:[n]\nThe more we advanced the more we realized that the Italians did not have much fight in them after putting up a strong resistance to our overwhelming advance and they started surrendering to our lead troops in droves. There was not much action to see but we came across lots of burnt out Italian tanks that had been destroyed by our tanks. I had never seen a battlefield before and the site  [sic] of so many dead was sickening.[110]\nBologna and the remainder of Trento Division tried to fight their way out of Alamein and marched in the desert without water, food, or transport before surrendering exhausted and dying from dehydration.[111] It was reported that Colonel Arrigo Dall'Olio, commanding the 40th Infantry Regiment of the Bologna,[112] surrendered saying, \"We have ceased firing not because we haven't the desire but because we have spent every round.\"[citation needed] In a symbolic act of final defiance, no one in 40th Bologna Infantry Regiment raised their hands. Harry Zinder of Time magazine noted that the Italians fought better than had been expected, and commented that for the Italians\nIt was a terrific letdown by their German allies. They had fought a good fight. In the south, the famed Folgore parachute division fought to the last round of ammunition. Two armoured divisions and a motorised division, which had been interspersed among the German formations, thought they would be allowed to retire gracefully with Rommel's 21st, 15th and 19th  [sic][o] light. But even that was denied them. When it became obvious to Rommel that there would be little chance to hold anything between El Daba and the frontier, his Panzers dissolved, disintegrated and turned tail, leaving the Italians to fight a rear-guard action.[113]\nBy late morning on 4 November, Rommel realised his situation was dire: \"The picture in the early afternoon of the 4th was as follows: powerful enemy armoured forces\u00a0... had burst a 19-kilometre hole in our front, through which strong bodies of tanks were moving to the west. As a result of this, our forces in the north were threatened with encirclement by enemy formations 20 times their number in tanks\u00a0... There were no reserves, as every available man and gun had been put into the line. So now it had come, the thing we had done everything in our power to avoid \u2013 our front broken and the fully motorised enemy streaming into our rear. Superior orders could no longer count. We had to save what there was to be saved.\"[106]\nRommel telegraphed Hitler for permission to fall back on Fuka. As further Allied blows fell, von Thoma was captured and reports came in from the Ariete and Trento that they were encircled. At 17:30, unable to wait any longer for a reply from Hitler, Rommel gave orders to retreat.[105]\nDue to insufficient transportation, most of the Italian infantry formations were abandoned and left to their fate.[114][115] Any chance of getting them away with an earlier move had been spoiled by the dictator's insistence that Rommel hold his ground, obliging him to keep the un-motorised Italian units well forward until it was too late.[116] To deepen the armoured thrusts, 1st Armoured Division was directed at El Daba, some 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) down the coast and 7th Armoured towards Galal, a further 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) west along the railway. Meanwhile, the New Zealand group had hoped to reach their objective by mid-morning on 5 November, but was held up by shell fire when picking their way through what turned out to be a dummy minefield and 15th Panzer were able to get there first.[117]\nMontgomery now realised that in order to finish the enemy off he would need to make even deeper armoured thrusts. 7th Armoured was ordered across country to intercept the coastal road at Sidi Haneish, 65\u00a0mi (105\u00a0km) west of the Rahman track while 1st Armoured, at that time west of El Dada, was ordered to take a wide detour through the desert to Bir Khalda, 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) west of the Rahman track preparatory to swinging up to cut the road at Mersa Matruh. Neither move proved successful. 7th Armoured finished the day 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) short of its objective. 1st Armoured determined to make up time with a night march, but in the darkness the armour became separated from their support vehicles and as a consequence ran out of fuel at dawn on 6 November, 16\u00a0mi (26\u00a0km) short of Bir Khalda. The Air Force continued to fly in support but because of the wide spread of the various X Corps units it was difficult to establish firm \"bomb lines\" demarcating areas in which troops and vehicles could be assumed to be those of the enemy and so free to be attacked.[118]\nBy 11:00 on 6 November, the \"B\" Echelon vehicles were starting to reconnect with 1st Armoured Division, but only enough partly to refuel two of the armoured regiments which set off again hoping to be in time to cut off the enemy. However, they ran out of fuel again, 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) south-west of Mersa Matruh. A fuel convoy had set out from Alamein on the evening of 5 November, but progress was slow as the tracks had become very cut up. By midday on the 6th, rain had started to fall and the convoy became bogged down, still 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) from the planned meeting point with the 1st Armoured Division \"B\" echelon support vehicles.[119]\nOn the morning of 6 November 2 New Zealand Division advanced toward Sidi Haneish while 10th Armoured Division's 8th Armoured Brigade had moved west from Galal to occupy the landing fields at Fuka and the escarpment. Roughly 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) south-west of Sidi Haneish, 7th Armoured Division had come upon 21st Panzer and the Voss Reconnaissance Group that morning. There was a series of clashes during the day during which 21st Panzer lost 16 tanks and numerous guns. They narrowly escaped encirclement, however, and escaped on wheels that evening to Mersa Matruh. Once again, it proved difficult to firmly identify targets for the air force but during the day US heavy bombers attacked Tobruk, sinking Etiopia (2,153 long tons (2,188\u00a0t)) and later attacked Benghazi, sinking the Mars and setting the tanker Portofino (6,572 GRT), alight.[120]\nOn 7 November, poor ground conditions after the rain and lack of fuel saw 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions remaining quiet. 10th Armoured Division, with the benefit of working on the coastal road and with ample fuel, pushed its tanks on to Mersa Matruh while its infantry mopped up on the road west of Galal.[121]\nRommel intended to fight a delaying action at Sidi Barrani, 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) west of Matruh, to give his retreating forces time to get through the bottleneck through the escarpment passes at Halfya and Sollum.[122] The last rearguards left Matruh on the night of 7/8 November but were only able to hold Sidi Barrani until the evening of the 9th. By the evening of 10 November the New Zealand Division, heading for Sollum, had 4th Light Armoured Brigade at the foot of the Halfya Pass while 7th Armoured Division was conducting another detour to the south aiming to swing round and take Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Azeiz. On the morning of 11 November, 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade stormed the pass taking 600 Italian prisoners.\nBy the end of the day on the 11th, the Egyptian border area was clear, but Montgomery was forced to order that the pursuit should\u2014for the time being\u2014be continued by armoured cars and artillery only because of the difficulty in supplying larger formations west of Bardia until the supply infrastructure could catch up.[123]\nAllied Forces attack: 10pm 23 October\nAxis Armoured Divisions counter-attack: 6pm 24 October\nAllies attempt to break through: Night of 25 October\nAxis counter-attack and attack by 9th Australian Division: Afternoon of 25 October\nFolgore Parachutist Division attacked from three directions: 10:30\u00a0pm 25 October until 3\u00a0am 26 October\nAllies advance- 51st Highland Division takes Kidney Ridge, Littorio Armoured Division counter-attacks: 5pm 26 October\nBoth sides redeploy their Forces: Night of 26 to 27 October\nAxis fails to retake Kidney Ridge: 8am 27 October\nAllies attempt to push back Trento Division: 28 October\nRommel redeploys his forces: 29 October\nOperation Supercharge begins, 9th Australian fails to break through: 11pm 31 October 1942.\nTank Battle of Tell el Aqqaqir: 9am 2 November; Axis forces begin retreat: 10pm 2 November\nAxis forces prepare to fall back: 3 November\nAxis forces halt their retreat: 3 November\nAllied forces break through: 7am 4 November; Trento, Bologna and Ariete Divisions destroyed, Axis forces flee\nEl Alamein was an Allied victory, although Rommel did not lose hope until the end of the Tunisia Campaign. Churchill said,\nIt may almost be said, \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat\".\nThe Allies frequently had numerical superiority in the Western Desert but never had it been so complete in quantity and quality. With the arrival of Sherman tanks, 6-pounder anti-tank guns and Spitfires in the Western Desert, the Allies gained a comprehensive superiority.[125] Montgomery envisioned the battle as an attrition operation, similar to those fought in World War I and correctly predicted the length of the battle and the number of Allied casualties. Allied artillery was superbly handled and Allied air support was excellent, in contrast to the Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica, which offered little or no support to ground forces, preferring to engage in air-to-air combat. Air supremacy had a huge effect on the battle and not only because of its physical impact. As Montgomery later wrote,\nThe moral effect of air action [on the enemy] is very great and out of all proportion to the material damage inflicted. In the reverse direction, the sight and sound of our own air forces operating against the enemy have an equally satisfactory effect on our own troops. A combination of the two has a profound influence on the most important single factor in war\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmorale.\nIn 2005, Barr wrote that the 36,939 men Panzerarmee casualties, was an estimate because of the chaos of the Axis retreat. British figures, based on Ultra intercepts, gave German casualties as 1,149 killed, 3,886 wounded and 8,050 men captured. Italian losses were 971 dead, 933 wounded and 15,552 men captured. By 11 November, the number of Axis prisoners had risen to 30,000 men.[12] In a note to The Rommel Papers, Fritz Bayerlein (quoting figures obtained from Offizieller Bericht des Oberkommandos Afrika) instead estimated German losses in the battle as 1,100 killed, 3,900 wounded and 7,900 prisoners and Italian losses as 1,200 killed, 1,600 wounded and 20,000 prisoners.[126]\nAccording to the official history of the Italian Army, Axis losses during the battle were 4,000 to 5,000 killed or missing, 7,000 to 8,000 wounded and 17,000 prisoners; during the retreat the losses rose to 9,000 killed or missing, 15,000 wounded and 35,000 prisoners.[127] According to the writings of General Giuseppe Rizzo, total Axis casualties included 25,000 men killed or wounded (including 5,920 Italians killed) and 30,000 prisoners (20,000 Italians and 10,724 Germans), as well as 510 tanks and 2,000 field guns, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns.[128] Axis tank losses were c.\u2009500; on 4 November, only 36 German tanks were left out of the 249 at the beginning of the battle. About half of the 278 Italian tanks had been lost and most of the remainder were knocked out on the next day by the 7th Armoured Division. About 254 Axis guns were lost, along with 64 German and 20 Italian aircraft.[12][129]\nThe Eighth Army had 13,560 casualties, of whom 2,350 men had been killed, 8,950 wounded and 2,260 men were missing; 58 percent of the casualties were British, 22 percent Australian, 10 percent New Zealanders, 6 percent South African, 1 percent Indian and 3 percent were Allied forces. The Eighth Army lost from 332\u00e2\u20ac\u201c500 tanks, although by the end of the battle, 300 had already been repaired. The artillery lost 111 guns and the DAF lost 77 British and 20 American aircraft.[13]\nThe Eighth Army was surprised by Rommel's withdrawal and confusion caused by redeployments between the three corps meant they were slow in pursuit, failing to cut off Rommel at Fuka and Mersa Matruh.[130] The Desert Air Force failed to make a maximum effort to bomb a disorganised and retreating opponent, which on 5 November was within range and confined to the coast road. Supply shortages and a belief that the Luftwaffe were about to get strong reinforcements, led the DAF to be cautious, reduce the number of offensive sorties on 5 November and protect the Eighth Army.[131]\nThe Axis made a fighting withdrawal to El Agheila but Rommel's troops found themselves exhausted and with few replacements, while Montgomery had planned to transport material over great distances, to provide the Eighth Army with 2,400\u00a0t (2,600 short tons) of supplies per day. Huge quantities of engineer stores had been collected to repair transport infrastructure and the railway line from El Alamein to Fort Capuzzo, despite having been blown up in over 200 places, was quickly repaired. In the month after Eighth Army reached Capuzzo, the railway carried 133,000 short tons (121,000\u00a0t) of supplies. Benghazi handled 3,000 short tons (2,700\u00a0t) a day by the end of December, rather than the expected 800 short tons (730\u00a0t).[132]\nMindful of Axis counter-strokes from El Agheila, Montgomery paused for three weeks to concentrate his forces and prepare an assault. On 11 December, Montgomery launched the 51st (Highland) Division along the line of the coast road with 7th Armoured Division on the inland flank. On 12 December the 2nd New Zealand Division started a deeper flanking manouevre to cut the Axis line of retreat on coast road in the rear of the Mersa Brega position.[133] The Highland Division made a slow and costly advance and 7th Armoured met stiff resistance from the Ariete Combat Group (the remains of the Ariete Armoured Division). Rommel's army had lost roughly 75,000 men, 1,000 guns and 500 tanks since the Second battle of Alamein and withdrew.[134] By 15 December, the New Zealanders had reached the coast road but the firm terrain allowed Rommel to break his forces into smaller units and withdraw off-road, through the gaps between the New Zealanders positions.[135]\nRommel conducted a text-book retreat, destroying all equipment and infrastructure left behind and peppering the land behind him with mines and booby traps.[136] Eighth Army reached Sirte on 25 December but west of Sirte, were forced to pause to consolidate their strung out formations, to prepare an attack at Wadi Zemzem near Buerat 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) east of Tripoli.[137] Rommel had, with the agreement of Field Marshal Bastico, sent a request to the Italian Comando Supremo in Rome to withdraw to Tunisia where the terrain would better suit a defensive action and where he could link with the Axis army forming there, in response to the Operation Torch landings. Mussolini replied on 19 December that the Panzer Army must resist to the last man at Buerat.[135]\nOn 15 January 1943, General Montgomery launched the 51st (Highland) Division in a frontal attack while sending the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 7th Armoured Division around the inland flank of the Axis line. Weakened by the withdrawal of 21st Panzer Division to Tunisia to strengthen von Arnim's Fifth Panzer Army (5. Panzerarmee), Rommel conducted a fighting retreat.[138] The port of Tripoli, some 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) further west, was taken on 23 January as Rommel continued to withdraw to the French-built southern defences of Tunisia, the Mareth Line.\nRommel was by this time in contact with von Arnim's Fifth Panzer Army, which had been fighting against the multi-national British First Army in northern Tunisia, since shortly after Operation Torch the previous autumn. Hitler was determined to retain hold of Tunisia and Rommel finally started to receive replacement men and materials. The Axis now faced a war in Africa on two fronts with Eighth Army approaching from the east and the British, French and Americans from the west. Rommel's German-Italian Panzer Army was renamed the Italian First Army under General Giovanni Messe and Rommel assumed command of the new Army Group Africa, responsible for both fronts.[citation needed] The two Allied armies were placed under 18th Army Group with Harold Alexander in command. The failure of British First Army forces in the run for Tunis in December 1942 led to a prolongation of the North African campaign which would not end until the Italian-German forces in North Africa capitulated in May 1943.",

        "text": "The Treaty of Versailles (French: Trait\u00e9 de Versailles) was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919 in Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand which directly led to World War I. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties.[8] Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919.\nOf the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required \"Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage\" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty forced Germany to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion marks (then $31.4 billion or \u00a36.6 billion, roughly equivalent to US $442 billion or UK \u00a3284 billion in 2018). At the time economists, notably John Maynard Keynes (a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference), predicted that the treaty was too harsh\u2014a \"Carthaginian peace\"\u2014and said the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive, views that, since then, have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists from several countries. On the other hand, prominent figures on the Allied side such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently.\nThe result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one content: Germany was neither pacified nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers, and the re-negotiation of the reparation system resulting in the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan, and the indefinite postponement of reparations at the Lausanne Conference of 1932.\nAlthough it is often referred to as the \"Versailles Conference\", only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the \"Big Four\" meetings taking place generally at the Quai d'Orsay.\nThe First World War (1914\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1918) was fought across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Countries beyond the war zones were also affected by the disruption of international trade, finance and diplomatic pressures from the belligerents.[9] In 1917, two revolutions occurred within the Russian Empire, which led to the collapse of the Imperial Government and the rise of the Bolshevik Party led by Vladimir Lenin.[10]\nOn 6 April 1917, the United States entered the war against the Central Powers due to German submarine warfare against merchant ships trading with France and Britain, which led to the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and the loss of 128 American lives, as well as the interception of the Zimmerman Telegram, sent by the Empire of Germany to Mexico, urging for a declaration of war against the United States. The American war aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions after the Bolshevik disclosure of secret treaties between the Allies. The existence of these treaties tended to discredit Allied claims that Germany was the sole power with aggressive ambitions.[11]\nOn 8 January 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson issued a statement that became known as the Fourteen Points. This speech outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, democracy and self-determination. It also called for a diplomatic end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to afford \"mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike\".[12][13] Wilson's speech also responded to Vladimir Lenin's Decree on Peace of November 1917, which proposed an immediate withdrawal of Russia from the war and called for a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexations. The Fourteen Points were based on the research of the Inquiry, a team of about 150 advisors led by foreign-policy advisor Edward M. House, into the topics likely to arise in the anticipated peace conference. Europeans generally welcomed Wilson's intervention, but Allied colleagues Georges Clemenceau of France, David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy were sceptical of Wilsonian idealism.[14]\nAfter the Central Powers launched Operation Faustschlag on the Eastern Front, the new Soviet Government of Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany on 3 March 1918.[15] This treaty ended the war between Russia and the Central powers and annexed 1,300,000 square miles (3,400,000\u00a0km2) of territory and 62 million people.[16] This loss equated to a third of the Russian population, a quarter of its territory, around a third of the country's arable land, three-quarters of its coal and iron, a third of its factories (totalling 54 percent of the nation's industrial capacity), and a quarter of its railroads.[16][17]\nDuring the autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse.[18] Desertion rates within the German army began to increase, and civilian strikes drastically reduced war production.[19][20] On the Western Front, the Allied forces launched the Hundred Days Offensive and decisively defeated the German western armies.[21] Sailors of the Imperial German Navy at Kiel mutinied, which prompted uprisings in Germany, which became known as the German Revolution.[22][23] The German government tried to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that they surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.[24][25][26]\nThe terms of the armistice called for an immediate evacuation of German troops from occupied Belgium, France, and Luxembourg within fifteen days.[27] In addition, it established that Allied forces would occupy the Rhineland. In late 1918, Allied troops entered Germany and began the occupation.[28]\nBoth the German Empire and Great Britain were dependent on imports of food and raw materials, primarily from the Americas, which had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The Blockade of Germany (1914\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1919) was a naval operation conducted by the Allied Powers to stop the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs reaching the Central Powers. The German Kaiserliche Marine was mainly restricted to the German Bight and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that 763,000 German civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at 424,000 people.[29]\nIn late 1918, a Polish government was formed and an independent Poland proclaimed. In December, Poles launched an uprising within the German province of Posen. Fighting lasted until February, when an armistice was signed that left the province in Polish hands, but technically still a German possession.[30]\nNegotiations between the Allied powers started on 18 January in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Initially, 70 delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations.[31] The defeated nations of Germany, Austria, and Hungary were excluded from the negotiations. Russia was also excluded because it had negotiated a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) with Germany in 1918. The terms of this treaty awarded Germany a large proportion of Russia's land and resources. Its terms were extremely harsh, as the negotiators at Versailles later pointed out.\nAt first a \"Council of Ten\" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan met officially to decide the peace terms. It became the \"Big Four\" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four nations met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions to be ratified by the entire assembly. Apart from Italian issues, the main conditions were determined at personal meetings among the leaders of the \"Big Three\" nations: British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, and American President Woodrow Wilson.\nThe minor nations attended a weekly \"Plenary Conference\" that discussed issues in a general forum, but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final treaty.[32][33]\nAs the only major allied power sharing a land border with Germany, France was chiefly concerned with weakening Germany as much as possible. The French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau described France's position best by telling Wilson: \"America is far away, protected by the ocean. Not even Napoleon himself could touch England. You are both sheltered; we are not.\" [34] Clemenceau and his colleagues hoped at the very least to have Allied troops occupy bridges over the Rhine and proposed a plan to create a buffer state in the Rhineland in order to create a barrier between a revitalized Germany and France. However, their demands would not be met by the treaty. Instead, France obtained the demilitarization of the Rhineland, a mandate over the Saar and promises of Anglo-American support in case of a new German aggression (a commitment that could not be relied on after the United States failed to ratify the treaty).[35] Clemenceau's inability to procure the Rhineland state led to fierce criticism of him in France and contributed to his subsequent fall from power.[36]\nBritish economist John Maynard Keynes argued,\nSo far as possible, therefore, it was the policy of France to set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished. By loss of territory and other measures her population was to be curtailed; but chiefly the economic system, upon which she depended for her new strength, the vast fabric built upon iron, coal, and transport must be destroyed. If France could seize, even in part, what Germany was compelled to drop, the inequality of strength between the two rivals for European hegemony might be remedied for generations.[37]\nFrance, which suffered significant destruction in its northern territories (the worst damage sustained in areas that formed a so-called Red Zone) and the second heaviest (after the Russian empire) human losses among allies (see main article World War I casualties), was adamant on the payment of reparations. The failure of the government of the Weimar Republic to pay these reparations led to the Occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian forces.\nBritain had suffered little land devastation during the war and Prime Minister David Lloyd George supported reparations to a lesser extent than the French. Britain began to look on a restored Germany as an important trading partner and worried about the effect of reparations on the British economy.[38]\nBefore the end of the war, President Woodrow Wilson put forward his Fourteen Points, which represented the liberal position at the Conference and helped shape world opinion. Wilson was concerned with rebuilding the European economy, encouraging self-determination, promoting free trade, creating appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, creating a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace. He opposed harsh treatment of Germany but was outmaneuvered by Britain and France. He brought along top intellectuals as advisors, but his refusal to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation made his efforts seem partisan, and it contributed to a risk of political defeat at home.[39]\nIn June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including Articles 227, 230 and 231.[nb 1] In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.[40] On 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed.[2] The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz.[41][42][43][44]\nThe treaty stripped Germany of 25,000 square miles (65,000\u00c2\u00a0km2) of territory and 7 million people. It also required Germany to give up the gains made via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and grant independence to the protectorates that had been established.[17] In Western Europe Germany was required to recognize Belgian sovereignty over Moresnet and cede control of the Eupen-Malmedy area. Within six months of the transfer, Belgium was required to conduct a plebiscite on whether the citizens of the region wanted to remain under Belgian sovereignty or return to German control, communicate the results to the League of Nations and abide by the League's decision.[45] To compensate for the destruction of French coal mines, Germany was to cede the output of the Saar coalmines to France and control of the Saar to the League of Nations for 15 years; a plebiscite would then be held to decide sovereignty.[46] The treaty \"restored\" the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France by rescinding the treaties of Versailles and Frankfurt of 1871 as they pertained to this issue.[47] The sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein was to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held at a future time (see Schleswig Plebiscites).[48]\nIn Eastern Europe, Germany was to recognize the independence of Czechoslovakia and cede parts of the province of Upper Silesia.[49] Germany had to recognize the independence of Poland and renounce \"all rights and title over the territory\". Portions of Upper Silesia were to be ceded to Poland, with the future of the rest of the province to be decided by plebiscite. The border would be fixed with regard to the vote and to the geographical and economic conditions of each locality.[50] The province of Posen (now Poznan), which had come under Polish control during the Greater Poland Uprising, was also to be ceded to Poland.[30][51] Pomerelia (Eastern Pomerania), on historical and ethnic grounds, was transferred to Poland so that the new state could have access to the sea and became known as the Polish Corridor.[52] The sovereignty of part of southern East Prussia was to be decided via plebiscite while the East Prussian Soldau area, which was astride the rail line between Warsaw and Danzig, was transferred to Poland outright without plebiscite.[53][54] An area of 51,800 square kilometres (20,000 square miles) was granted to Poland at the expense of Germany.[55] Memel was to be ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, for disposal according to their wishes.[56] Germany was to cede the city of Danzig and its hinterland, including the delta of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, for the League of Nations to establish the Free City of Danzig.[57]\nArticle 119 of the treaty required Germany to renounce sovereignty over former colonies and Article 22 converted the territories into League of Nations mandates under the control of Allied states.[58] Togoland and German Kamerun (Cameroon) were transferred to France. Ruanda and Urundi were allocated to Belgium, whereas German South-West Africa went to South Africa and the United Kingdom obtained German East Africa.[59][60][61] As compensation for the German invasion of Portuguese Africa, Portugal was granted the Kionga Triangle, a sliver of German East Africa in northern Mozambique.[62] Article 156 of the treaty transferred German concessions in Shandong, China, to Japan, not to China. Japan was granted all German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator and those south of the equator went to Australia, except for German Samoa, which was taken by New Zealand.[60][63]\nThe treaty was comprehensive and complex in the restrictions imposed upon the post-war German armed forces (the Reichswehr). The provisions were intended to make the Reichswehr incapable of offensive action and to encourage international disarmament.[64][65] Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920 to leave an army of no more than 100,000 men in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions. The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the General Staff was to be dissolved.[66] Military schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm, and conscription was abolished. Private soldiers and Non-commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of 25 years, with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises. To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.[67]\nThe number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force was reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden.[68] The Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden.[69] Military structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and D\u00fcne were to be destroyed.[70] Germany was prohibited from the arms trade, limits were imposed on the type and quantity of weapons and prohibited from the manufacture or stockpile of chemical weapons, armoured cars, tanks and military aircraft.[71] The German navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and was limited to a maximum of six light cruisers (not exceeding 6,000 long tons (6,100\u00a0t)), twelve destroyers (not exceeding 800 long tons (810\u00a0t)) and twelve torpedo boats (not exceeding 200 long tons (200\u00a0t)) and was forbidden submarines.[72] The manpower of the navy was not to exceed 15,000 men, including manning for the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration, other land services, officers and men of all grades and corps. The number of officers and warrant officers was not allowed to exceed 1,500 men.[73] Germany surrendered eight battleships, eight light cruisers, forty-two destroyers, and fifty torpedo boats for decommissioning. Thirty-two auxiliary ships were to be disarmed and converted to merchant use.[74] Article 198 prohibited Germany from having an air force, including naval air forces, and required Germany to hand over all aerial related materials. In conjunction, Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft or related material for a period of six months following the signing of the treaty.[75]\nIn Article 231 Germany accepted responsibility for the losses and damages caused by the war \"as a consequence of the ... aggression of Germany and her allies.\"[76][nb 2] The treaty required Germany to compensate the Allied powers, and it also established an Allied \"Reparation Commission\" to determine the exact amount which Germany would pay and the form that such payment would take. The commission was required to \"give to the German Government a just opportunity to be heard\", and to submit its conclusions by 1 May 1921. In the interim, the treaty required Germany to pay an equivalent of 20 billion gold marks ($5 billion) in gold, commodities, ships, securities or other forms. The money would help to pay for Allied occupation costs and buy food and raw materials for Germany.[81][82]\nTo ensure compliance, the Rhineland and bridgeheads east of the Rhine were to be occupied by Allied troops for fifteen years.[83] If Germany had not committed aggression, a staged withdrawal would take place; after five years, the Cologne bridgehead and the territory north of a line along the Ruhr would be evacuated. After ten years, the bridgehead at Coblenz and the territories to the north would be evacuated and after fifteen years remaining Allied forces would be withdrawn.[84] If Germany reneged on the treaty obligations, the bridgeheads would be reoccupied immediately.[85]\nPart I of the treaty, as per all the treaties signed during the Paris Peace Conference,[nb 3] was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which provided for the creation of the League, an organization for the arbitration of international disputes.[86] Part XIII organized the establishment of the International Labour Officer, to regulate hours of work, including a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of a living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed abroad; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures.[87] The treaty also called for the signatories to sign or ratify the International Opium Convention.[88]\nThe surrender of the German High Seas Fleet following the Armistice and its internment (and eventual scuttling) in Scapa Flow meant that Britain had already accomplished her primary war goal even before the Paris Peace Conference opened. With the German naval threat removed, Britain began focusing on Germany as a bulwark against the threat posed by the new Soviet Union.\nThus, British policy towards Germany began diverging from France's almost from the moment the guns fell silent. British officials at the conference declared French policy to be \"greedy\" and \"vindictive,\" with Ramsay MacDonald later announcing, after Hitler's re-militarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, that he was \"pleased\" that the treaty was \"vanishing\", expressing his hope that the French had been taught a \"severe lesson\".[89] In 1938, Lloyd George published a massive two-volume memoir titled The Truth About the Peace Treaties, in which he effectively repudiated the terms of the treaty that bore his signature.[90]\nFrance signed the treaty and was active in the League. The French people rejoiced that Alsace and Lorraine had been returned to France and that Germany had agreed to pay reparations. But the perception that Clemenceau had failed to achieve all of France's demands damaged him politically. When he stood for election as President of France in January 1920, he was defeated. Through much of the 1920s, France was the most vigorous of the wartime Allies in seeking to enforce the treaty's harsher terms, especially with regard to reparations. Without strong British support, however, she was largely unsuccessful. French Marshal Ferdinand Foch\u2014who felt the restrictions on Germany were too lenient\u2014prophetically predicted that \"this (treaty) is not peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years.\"[91]\nReaction in Italy to the treaty was extremely negative. The country had suffered high casualties, yet failed to achieve most of its major war goals, notably gaining control of the Dalmatian coast and Fiume. President Wilson rejected Italy's claims on the basis of \"national self-determination.\" For their part, Britain and France\u2014who had been forced in the war's latter stages to divert their own troops to the Italian front to stave off collapse\u2014were disinclined to support Italy's position at the peace conference. Differences in negotiating strategy between Premier Vittorio Orlando and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino further undermined Italy's position at the conference. A furious Vittorio Orlando suffered a nervous collapse and at one point walked out of the conference (though he later returned). He lost his position as prime minister just a week before the treaty was scheduled to be signed, effectively ending his active political career. Anger and dismay over the treaty's provisions helped pave the way for the establishment of Benito Mussolini's dictatorship three years later.\nPortugal entered the war on the Allied side in 1916 primarily to ensure the security of its African colonies, which were threatened with seizure by both Britain and Germany. To this extent, she succeeded in her war aims. The treaty recognized Portuguese sovereignty over these areas and awarded her small portions of Germany's bordering overseas colonies. Otherwise, however, Portugal obtained little at the peace conference. Her promised share of German reparations never materialized, and a seat she coveted on the executive council of the new League of Nations went instead to Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich had remained neutral in the war. In the end, Portugal ratified the treaty, but got little out of the war, which cost more than 8,000 Portuguese troops and as many as 100,000 of her African colonial subjects their lives.[92]\nAfter the Versailles conference, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson claimed that \"at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!\"[93] However, the Republican Party, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, controlled the US Senate after the election of 1918, and the senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.[94]\nA discontent bloc of 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 \"Irreconcilables\", mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the treaty. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge. A second group of Democrats supported the treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge,[95] comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article 10, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the US Congress.[96] All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.[97]\nThe closest the treaty came to passage was on 19 November 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification. Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the treaty, saying it favored the British.[98]\nAfter Wilson's presidency, his successor Republican President Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the formation of the League of Nations. Congress subsequently passed the Knox\u2013Porter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the United States and the Central Powers. It was signed into law by President Harding on 2 July 1921.[99][100] Soon after, the US\u2013German Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on 25 August 1921, the US\u2013Austrian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Vienna on 24 August 1921, and the US\u2013Hungarian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Budapest on 29 August 1921.\nChina felt betrayed as the German territory in China was handed to Japan. The sense of betrayal led to great demonstrations in China and the fall of the nascent Chinese Republic's government and poisoned relations with the West. [101][102]\nWilson's former friend Edward Mandell House, present at the negotiations, wrote in his diary on 29 June 1919:\nI am leaving Paris, after eight fateful months, with conflicting emotions. Looking at the conference in retrospect, there is much to approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who are saying that the treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.[103]\nOn 29 April, the German delegation under the leadership of the Foreign Minister Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau arrived in Versailles. On 7 May, when faced with the conditions dictated by the victors, including the so-called \"War Guilt Clause\", von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied to Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George: \"We know the full brunt of hate that confronts us here. You demand from us to confess we were the only guilty party of war; such a confession in my mouth would be a lie.\"[104] Because Germany was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, the German government issued a protest against what it considered to be unfair demands, and a \"violation of honour\",[105] soon afterwards withdrawing from the proceedings of the peace conference.\nGermans of all political shades denounced the treaty\u2014particularly the provision that blamed Germany for starting the war\u2014as an insult to the nation's honor. They referred to the treaty as \"the Diktat\" since its terms were presented to Germany on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Germany\u2032s first democratically elected head of government, Philipp Scheidemann, resigned rather than sign the treaty. In a passionate speech before the National Assembly on 21 March 1919, he called the treaty a \"murderous plan\" and exclaimed,\nWhich hand, trying to put us in chains like these, would not wither? The treaty is unacceptable.[106]\nAfter Scheidemann\u2032s resignation, a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer. President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west\u2014and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg\u2014after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener\u2014concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. However, rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities. Upon receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. Foreign minister Hermann M\u00fcller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116.[107]\nConservatives, nationalists and ex-military leaders condemned the treaty. Politicians of the Weimar Republic who supported the treaty, socialists, communists, and Jews were viewed with suspicion as persons of questionable loyalty.[citation needed] It was rumored that Jews had not supported the war and had played a role in selling Germany out to its enemies. Those who seemed to benefit from a weakened Germany and the newly formed Weimar Republic were regarded as having \"stabbed Germany in the back\". Those who instigated unrest and strikes in the critical military industries on the home front or who opposed German nationalism were seen to have contributed to Germany's defeat.[citation needed] These theories were given credence by the fact that when Germany surrendered in November 1918, its armies were still on French and Belgian territory. Furthermore, on the Eastern Front, Germany had already won the war against Russia and concluded the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In the West, Germany had seemed to have come close to winning the war with the Spring Offensive earlier in 1918.[citation needed] Its failure was blamed on strikes in the arms industry at a critical moment of the offensive, leaving soldiers with an inadequate supply of materiel. The strikes were regarded by nationalists as having been instigated by traitors, with the Jews taking most of the blame.[citation needed]\nThe German economy was so weak that only a small percentage of reparations was paid in hard currency.[citation needed] Nonetheless, even the payment of this small percentage of the original reparations (132 billion gold marks) still placed a significant burden on the German economy.[citation needed] Although the causes of the devastating post-war hyperinflation are complex and disputed, Germans blamed the near-collapse of their economy on the treaty, and some economists estimated that the reparations accounted for as much as one-third of the hyper-inflation.[citation needed]\nIn March 1921, French and Belgian troops occupied Duisburg, which formed part of the demilitarized Rhineland, according to the Treaty of Versailles.[citation needed] In January 1923, French and Belgian forces occupied the rest of the Ruhr area as a reprisal after Germany failed to fulfill reparation payments demanded by the Versailles Treaty. The German government answered with \"passive resistance\", which meant that coal miners and railway workers refused to obey any instructions by the occupation forces.[citation needed] Production and transportation came to a standstill, but the financial consequences contributed to German hyperinflation and completely ruined public finances in Germany. Consequently, passive resistance was called off in late 1923.[citation needed] The end of passive resistance in the Ruhr allowed Germany to undertake a currency reform and to negotiate the Dawes Plan, which led to the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr Area in 1925.[citation needed]\nSome significant violations of the provisions of the treaty were:\nAccording to David Stevenson, since the opening of French archives, most commentators have remarked on French restraint and reasonableness at the conference, though Stevenson notes that \"[t]he jury is still out\", and that \"there have been signs that the pendulum of judgement is swinging back the other way.\"[115]\nIn his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace, John Maynard Keynes referred to the Treaty of Versailles as a \"Carthaginian peace\", a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. He stated: \"I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.\"[116] Keynes had been the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, and used in his passionate book arguments that he and others (including some US officials) had used at Paris.[117] He believed the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic instability.[118]\nFrench economist \u00c9tienne Mantoux disputed that analysis. During the 1940s, Mantoux wrote a posthumously published book titled The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes in an attempt to rebut Keynes' claims. More recently economists have argued that the restriction of Germany to a small army saved it so much money it could afford the reparations payments.[119]\nIt has been argued (for instance by historian Gerhard Weinberg in his book A World At Arms[120]) that the treaty was in fact quite advantageous to Germany. The Bismarckian Reich was maintained as a political unit instead of being broken up, and Germany largely escaped post-war military occupation (in contrast to the situation following World War II). In a 1995 essay, Weinberg noted that with the disappearance of Austria-Hungary and with Russia withdrawn from Europe, that Germany was now the dominant power in Eastern Europe.[121]\nThe British military historian Correlli Barnett claimed that the Treaty of Versailles was \"extremely lenient in comparison with the peace terms that Germany herself, when she was expecting to win the war, had had in mind to impose on the Allies\". Furthermore, he claimed, it was \"hardly a slap on the wrist\" when contrasted with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Germany had imposed on a defeated Russia in March 1918, which had taken away a third of Russia's population (albeit of non-Russian ethnicity), one-half of Russia's industrial undertakings and nine-tenths of Russia's coal mines, coupled with an indemnity of six billion marks.[122] Eventually, even under the \"cruel\" terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany\u2032s economy had been restored to its pre-war status.\nBarnett also claims that, in strategic terms, Germany was in fact in a superior position following the Treaty than she had been in 1914. Germany\u2032s eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former Austrian Empire fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by revolution and civil war, and the newly restored Poland was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by France and Belgium, both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty \"much enhanced\" German power.[123] Britain and France should have (according to Barnett) \"divided and permanently weakened\" Germany by undoing Bismarck's work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again.[124] By failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain \"had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War\".[125]\nThe British historian of modern Germany, Richard J. Evans, wrote that during the war the German right was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them.[126] Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles.[126] Evans further noted that the parties of the Weimar Coalition, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Christian democratic Centre Party, were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to claim as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the Weimar Republic.[126] Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the Great Depression of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the \"main cause\" of National Socialism and the German economy was \"only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations\".[126]\nEwa Thompson points out that the treaty allowed numerous nations in Central and Eastern Europe to liberate themselves from oppressive German rule, a fact that is often neglected by Western historiography, more interested in understanding the German point of view. In nations that found themselves free as the result of the treaty\u2014such as Poles or Czechs\u2014it is seen as a symbol of recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by their much larger aggressive neighbours.[127]\nRegardless of modern strategic or economic analysis, resentment caused by the treaty sowed fertile psychological ground for the eventual rise of the Nazi Party.[citation needed] The German historian Detlev Peukert wrote that Versailles was far from the impossible peace that most Germans claimed it was during the interwar period, and though not without flaws was actually quite reasonable to Germany.[128] Rather, Peukert argued that it was widely believed in Germany that Versailles was a totally unreasonable treaty, and it was this \"perception\" rather than the \"reality\" of the Versailles treaty that mattered.[128] Peukert noted that because of the \"millenarian hopes\" created in Germany during World War I when for a time it appeared that Germany was on the verge of conquering all of Europe, any peace treaty the Allies of World War I imposed on the defeated German Reich were bound to create a nationalist backlash, and there was nothing the Allies could have done to avoid that backlash.[128] Having noted that much, Peukert commented that the policy of rapprochement with the Western powers that Gustav Stresemann carried out between 1923 and 1929 were constructive policies that might have allowed Germany to play a more positive role in Europe, and that it was not true that German democracy was doomed to die in 1919 because of Versailles.[128] Finally, Peukert argued that it was the Great Depression and the turn to a nationalist policy of autarky within Germany at the same time that finished off the Weimar Republic, not the Treaty of Versailles.[128]\nFrench historian Raymond Cartier states that millions of Germans in the Sudetenland and in Posen-West Prussia were placed under foreign rule in a hostile environment, where harassment and violation of rights by authorities are documented.[129] Cartier asserts that, out of 1,058,000 Germans in Posen-West Prussia in 1921, 758,867 fled their homelands within five years due to Polish harassment.[129] In 1926, the Polish Ministry of the Interior estimated the remaining number of Germans at fewer than 300,000.[citation needed] These sharpening ethnic conflicts would lead to public demands to reattach the annexed territory in 1938 and become a pretext for Hitler\u2032s annexations of Czechoslovakia and parts of Poland.[129]",

Good at his job, and no common hood, Ray is normally a devoted family man as well. He experiences his own problems when his menacing father, Mickey Donovan (Jon Voight), is unexpectedly released from prison, and the FBI attempts to bring down Ray and his associates.\nRay Donovan has received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the first season a rating of 76% based on reviews from 38 critics, with the sites consensus stating: \"Ray Donovan moves quickly between genres and tones, with Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight's performances making the whiplash worth it\".[17] Metacritic gives the first season a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".[18]\nTim Goodman, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, said that \"Showtime has another gem on their hands\" and the casting of Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight was \"gold\".[19]\nThe first season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 10, 2014.[28] The second season was released on both media on May 26, 2015.

        "text": "The Vampire Diaries is an American supernatural drama television series developed by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec, based on the popular book series of the same name written by L. J. Smith. The series premiered on The CW on September 10, 2009, and concluded on March 10, 2017, airing 171 episodes over eight seasons.\nThe pilot episode attracted the largest audience for The CW of any series premiere since the network began in 2006.[1] The first season averaged 3.60 million viewers.[2] It was the most-watched series on the network before being supplanted by Arrow. The show has received numerous award nominations, winning four People's Choice Award and many Teen Choice Awards.\nOn April 26, 2013, The CW officially announced that the spin-off The Originals, which focuses on the Original family of vampires, had been ordered to series, and the show began airing during the 2013\u201314 American television season.[3]\nOn April 6, 2015, lead actress Nina Dobrev confirmed via Instagram that she and co-star Michael Trevino (who plays Tyler Lockwood) would be leaving the show after its sixth season. Dobrev returned to record a voiceover for the seventh-season finale.[4] Trevino appeared as a guest star in season seven and returned for season 8.[5][6] On March 11, 2016, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season,[7] but on July 23, 2016, announced that the eighth season, which would have 16 episodes, would be the show's last.[8] The final season began airing on October 21, 2016.\nThe series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural history since its settlement of migrants from New England in the late 19th century. It follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident, as she falls in love with a 162-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley). Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) returns, with a plan to bring back their past lover Katherine Pierce, a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. Although Damon is initially the villain and harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine. The brothers' history and the town's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.\nAdditional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, most notably Elena's younger brother Jeremy Gilbert (Steven R. McQueen), her best friends Bonnie Bennett, (Kat Graham), and Caroline Forbes (Candice King), their mutual friends Tyler Lockwood (Michael Trevino), and Matt Donovan (Zach Roerig), and their history teacher, vampire hunter Alaric Saltzman (Matthew Davis). The town's politics are orchestrated by descendants of the original founding families, all comprising a \"Founders' Council.\" The founding families of Mystic Falls includes the Salvatores, the Gilberts, the Fells, the Forbes, and the Lockwoods. They guard the town mainly from vampires, although there are many more supernatural threats such as werewolves, witches, hybrids, ghosts and many more.\nInitially, Kevin Williamson had little interest in developing the series, finding the premise too similar to other vampire tales. However, at the urging of Julie Plec, he began to read the novels and started to become intrigued by the story: \"I began to realize that it was a story about a small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface.\"[23] Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school.[24]\nOn February 6, 2009, Variety announced that The CW had green-lit the pilot for The Vampire Diaries with Williamson and Julie Plec set as the head writers and executive producers.[25] On May 19, 2009, the series was officially ordered for the 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2010 season.[26]\nThe pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, but the rest of the episodes have been filmed in Covington, Georgia (which doubles as the show's fictional small town of Mystic Falls, Virginia) and various other communities around Greater Atlanta[27] to take advantage of local tax incentives. On the morning of May 10, 2012, a fire broke out in the building on Clark Street in Covington that was used as the setting for Mystic Grill on the show.[28]\nThe series was given a full 22-episode order on October 21, 2009, after strong ratings for the first half of the season. Now there is a spin-off called The Originals, that goes into depth about the original vampire family from The Vampire Diaries.[29] On February 16, 2010, The CW announced that it had renewed the show for a second season,[30] which premiered on September 9, 2010.[31] On April 26, 2011, The CW renewed the show for a third season.[32] The third season premiered on September 15, 2011.[33] The fourth season premiered October 11, 2012. The CW renewed the show for a fifth season on February 11, 2013.[34] On February 13, 2014, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season.[35] On January 11, 2015, the CW renewed the series for a seventh season.\nPresident of The CW, Mark Pedowitz, said in an interview at the summer TCA's that The Vampire Diaries didn't receive an extra episode order for the second season at the request of Kevin Williamson. Kevin Williamson felt to do the best show possible, he would rather do 22 episodes. \"I'd rather have a great 22 than a good 24 if Kevin couldn't do it,\" he explained.[36] The first writers meeting for the fifth season held on April 15, 2013. Filming began on July 10, 2013, and finished on April 10, 2014. On July 23, 2016, it was announced that show would end after a 16-episode eighth season.[37]\nThe Vampire Diaries initially received mixed reviews, which through the course of the show improved greatly. Metacritic gave the show a Metascore of 50 (out of 100) based on 22 critical reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[38] Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot a B+, declaring that the show \"signals a welcome return to form for writer-producer Kevin Williamson.\" Reviewer, Ken Tucker, ended his review by writing that \"Diaries promises us a season of sharp-tongued amusement.\"[39] Linda Stasi of the New York Post gave the premiere a perfect score, saying that she was \"hooked after one episode.\" Stasi praised the pacing of the episode and the \"vicious, bloody vamp action,\" which \"starts in the opening scene and continues throughout The Vampire Diaries with such ferocity and speed that it's truly scary.\"[40] Conversely, San Francisco Chronicle's, Tim Goodman, gave the episode a highly critical review, calling the series \"awful.\" Goodman disliked the dialogue and hoped that the extras on Buffy the Vampire Slayer would \"return en masse to eat the cast of Vampire Diaries, plus any remaining scripts.\"[41]\nMany TV critics felt the series improved with each episode. Sarah Hughes of The Independent says The Vampire Diaries turns into \"a well-crafted, interestingly developed series\" despite a poor opening episode.[23] The New York Post also praised the portrayal of Elena, finding the character to be a strong-minded woman who did not allow her feelings for her boyfriend to control her.[42] Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune said that \"the supernatural drama is a first-class production, featuring an insanely gorgeous cast, sharp scripts, and a brooding vibe that is hard for even the most levelheaded adult to resist.\"[43] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave the series an honorable mention on his list of the top TV shows of 2009.[44]\nThe show's second season opened to favorable reviews from professional television critics as it received a 78/100 score on Metacritic. As the series progressed and developed onto the third season, critics praised the portrayals of the main characters and the development of the female characters such as Elena Gilbert played by Nina Dobrev, Bonnie Bennett played by Kat Graham, and Caroline Forbes played by Candice King.\nThe third-season finale, \"The Departed,\" received critical acclaim. Diana Steenbergen of IGN praised the episode and the writers for clearing up a couple story lines and making all of them come to a head. She also praised Dobrev's performance in this episode, addressing her behaviour as another reason the final revelation from Meredith was more shocking and believable. Similarly, Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly review praised the writer's skills in creating the more unexpected final twist.[45]\nThe series premiere of The Vampire Diaries on September 10, 2009, gave The CW its biggest series premiere, scoring 4.91 million viewers.[46] Adding in DVR numbers, the ratings for the premiere swelled to an official 5.7 million viewers.[47] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"as with several other shows that focus on the supernatural\", The Vampire Diaries was \"slightly more popular outside of cities. That said, the show's fandom has the smallest amount of spatial variation of all 50 shows\".[48]\nThe following is a table for the seasonal rankings based on average total estimated viewers per episode of The Vampire Diaries. \"Rank\" refers to how The Vampire Diaries rated compared to the other television series which aired during prime time hours.\nThe Vampire Diaries won 7 Teen Choice Awards in 2010 including: Choice TV Show: Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Choice TV Actor: Fantasy/Sci-Fi (Paul Wesley), Choice TV Actress: Fantasy/Sci-Fi (Nina Dobrev), Choice TV: Villain (Ian Somerhalder), Choice TV: Breakout Show, Choice TV: Female Breakout Star (Nina Dobrev) and Choice TV: Male Breakout Star (Paul Wesley).[70][71] Other nominations were Choice Male Hottie (Ian Somerhalder) and Choice TV: Female Scene Stealer (Kat Graham).[72] The show won an award for Favorite New TV Drama at the 2010 People's Choice Awards and received a nomination for Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show.[73] It was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Network TV Series.[74] On November 9, 2010, it received nominations for Favourite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show and Favourite TV Drama as well as a nomination for Ian Somerhalder in the TV Drama Actor category at the 2011 People's Choice Awards.[75]\nIn 2011, The Vampire Diaries was nominated for 12 Teen Choice Awards including: Choice TV Show: Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Choice TV Actor: Fantasy/Sci-Fi (Paul Wesley), Choice TV Actor: Fantasy/Sci-Fi (Ian Somerhalder), Choice TV Actress: Fantasy/Sci-Fi (Nina Dobrev), Choice TV: Villain (Joseph Morgan), Choice TV: Female Scene Stealer (Kat Graham), Choice TV: Male Scene Stealer (Michael Trevino), Choice Female Hottie (Nina Dobrev), Choice Male Hottie (Ian Somerhalder) and Choice Vampire (Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley).[76]\nAt the 2012 People's Choice Awards, the show gained four nominations: Best TV Drama, Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy, Drama Actor for Ian Somerhalder and Drama Actress for Nina Dobrev.

        "text": "The Mayflower was an English ship that famously transported the first English Puritans, known today as the Pilgrims, from Plymouth, England to the New World in 1620.[1] There were 102 passengers, and the crew is estimated to have been about 30, but the exact number is unknown.[2] This voyage has become an iconic story in some of the earliest annals of American history, with its story of death and of survival in the harsh New England winter environment. The culmination of the voyage in the signing of the Mayflower Compact was an event which established a rudimentary form of democracy, with each member contributing to the welfare of the community.[3] There was a second ship named Mayflower that made the London to Plymouth, Massachusetts voyage several times.\nThe Pilgrim ship Mayflower was square-rigged and beak-bowed with high, castle-like structures fore and aft that served to protect the ship's crew and the main deck from the elements\u2014designs that were typical with English merchant ships of the early 17th century. Her stern carried a 30-foot high, square aft-castle which made the ship extremely difficult to sail against the wind and unable to sail well against the North Atlantic's prevailing westerlies, especially in the fall and winter of 1620, and the voyage from England to America took more than two months as a result. The Mayflower's return trip to London in April\u2013May 1621 took less than half that time, with the same strong winds now blowing in the direction of the voyage.[4][5]\nNo dimensions of her hull can be stated exactly, since this was many years before such measurements were standardized. She probably measured about 100 feet (30 m) in length from the forward end at the beak of her prow to the tip of her stern superstructure aft. She was about 25 feet (7.6 m) at her widest point, with the bottom of her keel about 12 feet (3.6 m) below the waterline. William Bradford estimated that Mayflower had a cargo capacity of 180 tons. Surviving records from that time indicate that she could certainly accommodate 180 casks of wine in her cargo hold. The casks were great barrels holding hundreds of gallons of claret wine each.[5]\nThis was a ship that traditionally was heavily armed while on trading routes around Europe, due to the possibility of encountering pirates and privateers of all types. And with its armament, the ship and crew could easily be conscripted by the English monarch at any time in case of conflict with other nations.[6] By 1620, the Mayflower was aging, nearing the end of the usual 15-year working life of an English merchant ship in that era.\nThe general layout of the ship was as follows:\nAft on the main deck in the stern was the cabin for Master Christopher Jones, measuring about ten by seven feet (3 m \u00c3\u2014 2.1 m). Forward of that was the steerage room, which housed a whipstaff (tiller extension) for sailing control; not a wheel, as in later ships. Also here was the ship's compass and probably also berths for the ship's officers. Forward of the steerage room was the capstan, a vertical axle used to pull in ropes or cables. Far forward on the main deck, just aft of the bow, was the forecastle space where the ship's cook prepared meals for the crew; it may also have been where the ship's sailors slept.[6]\nThe poop deck was above the cabin of Master Jones, on the ship's highest level above the stern on the aft castle. The poop house was on this deck, which may have been for passengers' use either for sleeping or cargo. On normal merchant ships, this space was probably a chart room or a cabin for the master's mates.[8][9]\nThe gun deck was where the passengers resided during the voyage, in a space measuring about 50 by 25 feet (15.2\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a07.6\u00a0m) with a five-foot (1.5\u00a0m) overhead (ceiling). But it was also a dangerous place in conflict, as it had port and starboard gun ports from which cannon could be run out to fire on the enemy. The gun room was in the stern area of the gun deck, to which passengers had no access due to it being the storage space for powder and ammunition for the ship's cannons and any other weapons belonging to the ship. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannons used to fire out the stern of the ship. Forward on the gun deck in the bow area was a windlass, equipment similar in function to the capstan in steerage, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck. To get up to the main deck, passengers were required to climb a wooden or rope ladder.[8][9]\nThere was no facility for a latrine or privy on the Mayflower, and ship's crew had to fend for themselves in that regard. Gun deck passengers most likely used a bucket as a chamber pot, affixed to the deck or bulkhead to keep it from being jostled at sea.[9][10]\nThe largest gun was a minion cannon which was brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545 kg), and could shoot a 3.5 pound (1.6 kg) cannonball almost a mile (1,600 m). The Mayflower also had on board a saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360 kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90 kg) which shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85\u00e2\u20ac\u201c140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the port and starboard sides of her gun deck: seven cannons for long range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls. Later at New Plymouth, Mayflower Master Jones unloaded four of the pieces to help fortify the colony against invaders, and would not have done so unless he was comfortable with the armament that he still had on board.[5]\nBelow the gun deck was the cargo hold where the passengers kept most of their food stores and other supplies. Other items included most of their clothing and bedding. The hold also stored the passengers' personal weapons and military equipment \u2013 armor, muskets, gunpowder, and shot, as well as swords and bandoliers. It also stored all the tools that the Pilgrims would need, as well as all the equipment and utensils needed to prepare meals in the New World. It is also known that some Pilgrims loaded trade goods on board, including Isaac Allerton, William Mullins, and possibly others; these also most likely were stored in the cargo hold.[10]\nIt is not known when and where the Mayflower was built, but it is likely that she was launched at Harwich in the county of Essex, England. She was designated as \"of Harwich\" in the Port Books of 1609\u00e2\u20ac\u201c11, although later known as \"of London\". Harwich was also the birthplace of Mayflower master Christopher Jones about 1570.[11]\nCaptain Jones became master of the Mayflower 11 years prior to the Pilgrims' voyage, sailing the ship cross-Channel taking English woolens to France and bringing French wine to London. In addition, he had also transported hats, hemp, Spanish salt, hops, and vinegar to Norway, and may have taken the Mayflower whaling in the North Atlantic in the Greenland area. She had traveled to Mediterranean ports, being then owned by Christopher Nichols, Robert Child, Thomas Short, and Christopher Jones, the ship's master. In 1620, Jones and Robert Child still owned their quarter shares in the ship, and it was from them that Thomas Weston chartered her in the summer of 1620 to undertake the Pilgrim voyage. Weston had a significant role in the Mayflower voyage, due to his membership in the Company of Merchant Adventurers, and he eventually traveled to the Plymouth Colony himself.[4][12][13]\nThere were 26 vessels bearing the same name as the Pilgrim ship in the Port Books of England in the reign of James I (1603\u20131625), and the reason for this popularity of the name has never been found.[14] One particular Mayflower that has caused historical confusion is a Mayflower erroneously identified as one of the 1620 Pilgrims. This ship was partly owned by John Vassall and was outfitted for Queen Elizabeth in 1588, during the time of the Spanish Armada, a war for which Vassall outfitted several ships. However, there are no records of Vassall's Mayflower after 1594.[15] The identity of Captain Jones's Mayflower is based on records of the time of her home port, her tonnage (est. 180\u2013200 tons), and the master's name in 1620 in order to avoid confusion with the many other Mayflower ships.[14]\nRecords dating from August 1609 first note Christopher Jones as master and part owner of the Mayflower when his ship was chartered for a voyage from London to Trondheim in Norway and back to London. The ship lost an anchor on her return, due to bad weather, and made short delivery of her cargo of herrings. Litigation resulted, and this was still proceeding in 1612.\nChristopher Jones is described in a document of January 1611 as being \"of Harwich\", and his ship is called the Mayflower of Harwich (in the county of Essex). Records of Jones's ship Mayflower show that the ship was twice on the Thames at London in 1613, once in July and again in October and November. Records of 1616 again state that Jones's ship was on the Thames, carrying a cargo of wine, which suggests that the ship had recently been on a voyage to France, Spain, Portugal, the Canaries, or some other wine-producing land.\nAfter 1616, there is no further record which specifically relates to Jones's Mayflower until 1624. This is unusual for a ship trading to London, as it would not usually disappear from the records for such a long time. And no Admiralty court document can be found relating to the pilgrim fathers' voyage of 1620, although this might be due to the unusual way in which the transfer of the pilgrims was arranged from Leyden to New England. Or some of the records of the period may have been lost.\nApproximately 65 passengers embarked the Mayflower in the middle of July 1620 at its home port in the Rotherhithe district of London on the Thames river. The ship then proceeded down the Thames into the English Channel and then on to the south coast of England to anchor at Southampton Water. The Mayflower waited there for a rendezvous on July 22 with the Speedwell. Speedwell was coming from Holland with English separatist Puritans, members of the Leiden congregation who had been living in Holland to escape religious persecution in England.\nThe two ships set sail for America around August 5, but the Speedwell sprang a leak shortly after, and the two ships were brought into Dartmouth for repairs. They made a new start after the repairs, and they were more than 200 miles (320 km) beyond Land's End at the southwestern tip of England when Speedwell sprang another leak. It was now early September, and they had no choice but to abandon the Speedwell and make a determination on her passengers. This was a dire event, as the ship had wasted vital funds and was considered very important to the future success of their settlement in America. Both ships returned to Plymouth, where some of the Speedwell passengers joined the Mayflower and others returned to Holland. The Mayflower then continued on her voyage to America, and the Speedwell was sold soon afterwards.\nMayflower carried 102 passengers plus a crew of 25 to 30 officers and men, bringing the total to approximately 130.[16] According to William Bradford, Speedwell was refitted and \"made many voyages... to the great profit of her owners.\" Bradford later implied that the Speedwell's master used \"cunning and deceit\" to abort the voyage, possibly by causing leaks in the ship and motivated by a fear of starving to death in America.[17]\nIn early September, western gales began to make the North Atlantic a dangerous place for sailing. The Mayflower's provisions were already quite low when departing Southampton, and they became lower still by delays of more than a month. The passengers had been on board the ship for this entire time, and they were quite worn out and in no condition for a very taxing, lengthy Atlantic journey cooped up in cramped spaces in a small ship. But the Mayflower sailed from Plymouth on September 6, 1620 with what Bradford called \"a prosperous wind\".[18]\nAboard the Mayflower were many stores that supplied the pilgrims with the essentials needed for their journey and future lives. It is assumed that they carried tools and weapons, including cannon, shot, and gunpowder, as well as some live animals, including dogs, sheep, goats, and poultry. Horses and cattle came later. The ship also carried two boats: a long boat and a \"shallop\", a 21-foot boat powered by oars or sails. She also carried 12 artillery pieces (eight minions and four sakers), as the Pilgrims feared that they might need to defend themselves against enemy European forces, as well as the natives.[19]\nThe passage was a miserable one, with huge waves constantly crashing against the ship's topside deck until a key structural support timber fractured. The passengers had already suffered agonizing delays, shortages of food, and other shortages, and they were now called upon to provide assistance to the ship's carpenter in repairing the fractured main support beam. This was repaired with the use of a metal mechanical device called a jackscrew, which had been loaded on board to help in the construction of settler homes. It was now used to secure the beam to keep it from cracking further, making the ship seaworthy enough.[19][20]\nThe crew of the Mayflower had some devices to assist them en route, such as a compass for navigation, as well as a log and line system to measure speed in nautical miles per hour (knots). Time was measured with the ancient method of an hourglass.\nOn November 9, 1620, they sighted present-day Cape Cod. They spent several days trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, where they had obtained permission to settle from the Company of Merchant Adventurers. However, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, well north of the intended area, where they anchored on November 11. The settlers wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact after the ship dropped anchor at Cape Cod, in what is now Provincetown Harbor, in order to establish legal order and to quell increasing strife within the ranks.[21][22][23][24]\nOn Monday, November 27, an exploring expedition was launched under the direction of Capt. Christopher Jones to search for a suitable settlement site. As master of the Mayflower, Jones was not required to assist in the search, but he apparently thought it in his best interest to assist the search expedition. There were 34 persons in the open shallop: 24 passengers and 10 sailors. They were obviously not prepared for the bitter winter weather which they encountered on their reconnoiter, the Mayflower passengers not being accustomed to winter weather much colder than back home. They were forced to spend the night ashore due to the bad weather which they encountered, ill-clad in below-freezing temperatures with wet shoes and stockings that became frozen. Bradford wrote, \"Some of our people that are dead took the original of their death here\" on that expedition.[25]\nThe settlers explored the snow-covered area and discovered an empty native village, now known as Corn Hill in Truro. The curious settlers dug up some artificially made mounds, some of which stored corn, while others were burial sites. The modern writer Nathaniel Philbrick claims that the settlers stole the corn and looted and desecrated the graves,[26] sparking friction with the locals.[27] Philbrick goes on to say that they explored the area of Cape Cod for several weeks as they moved down the coast to what is now Eastham, and he claims that the Pilgrims were looting and stealing native stores as they went.[28] He then writes about how they decided to relocate to Plymouth after a difficult encounter with the Nausets at First Encounter Beach in December 1620.\nHowever, the only contemporary account of events, William Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation, records only that the pilgrims took \"some\" of the corn, to show to others back at the boat, leaving the rest. They later took what they needed from another store of grain, but paid the natives back in six months, and there was no resulting conflict.\nAlso there was found more of their corn and of their beans of various colors; the corn and beans they brought away, purposing to give them full satisfaction when they should meet with any of them as, about some six months afterward they did, to their good content.[29]\nDuring the winter, the passengers remained on board the Mayflower, suffering an outbreak of a contagious disease described[by whom?] as a mixture of scurvy, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. When it ended, only 53 passengers remained\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust over half; half of the crew died, as well. In the spring, they built huts ashore, and the passengers disembarked from the Mayflower on March 21, 1621.\nThe settlers decided to mount \"our great ordnances\" on the hill overlooking the settlement in late February 1621, due to the fear of attack by the natives. Christopher Jones supervised the transportation of the \"great guns\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout six iron cannons that ranged between four and eight feet (1.2 to 2.4 m) in length and weighed almost half a ton. The cannon were able to hurl iron balls 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) in diameter as far as 1,700 yards (1.5 km). This action made what was no more than a ramshackle village almost into a well-defended fortress.[30]\nJones had originally planned to return to England as soon as the Pilgrims found a settlement site. But his crew members began to be ravaged by the same diseases that were felling the Pilgrims, and he realized that he had to remain in Plymouth Harbor \"till he saw his men began to recover.\"[31] The Mayflower lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21, then set sail for England on April 5, 1621, her empty hold ballasted with stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore. As with the Pilgrims, her sailors had been decimated by disease. Jones had lost his boatswain, his gunner, three quartermasters, the cook, and more than a dozen sailors.\nThe Mayflower made excellent time on her voyage back to England. The westerly winds that had buffeted her coming out pushed her along going home, and she arrived at the home port of Rotherhithe in London on May 6, 1621,[32] less than half the time that it had taken her to sail to America.\"[33]\nJones died after coming back from a voyage to France on March 5, 1622, at about age 52. For the next two years, the Mayflower lay at her berth in Rotherhithe, not far from Jones' grave at St. Mary's church. By 1624, she was no longer useful as a ship; her subsequent fate is unknown, but she was probably broken up about that time.[34]\nSome families traveled together, while some men came alone, leaving families in England and Leiden. Two wives on board were pregnant; Elizabeth Hopkins gave birth to son Oceanus while at sea, and Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine in late November while the ship was anchored in Cape Cod Harbor. He is historically recognized as the first European child born in the New England area. One child died during the voyage, and there was one stillbirth during the construction of the colony.\nAccording to the Mayflower passenger list, just over a third of the passengers were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Others were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618.[35] Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council.[36][37] For instance it was proven that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate.[38] Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.[39]\nThe passengers mostly slept and lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 feet large (23 m \u00d7 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25 ft by 15 ft (7.6 m \u00d7 4.5 m) at its largest. Below decks, any person over five feet (150 cm) tall would be unable to stand up straight. The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.[40]\nPassengers would pass the time by reading by candlelight or playing cards and games such as Nine Men's Morris.[19] Meals on board were cooked by the firebox, which was an iron tray with sand in it on which a fire was built. This was risky because it was kept in the waist of the ship. Passengers made their own meals from rations that were issued daily and food was cooked for a group at a time.[40]\nUpon arrival in America, the harsh climate and scarcity of fresh food were exacerbated by the shortness of provisions due to the delay in departure. Living in these extremely close and crowded quarters, several passengers developed scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. At the time the use of lemons or limes to counter this disease was unknown, and the usual dietary sources of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables had been depleted, since these fresh foods could not be stored for long periods without their becoming rotten. Passengers who developed scurvy experienced symptoms such as bleeding gums, teeth falling out, and stinking breath.[41]\nPassengers consumed large amounts of alcohol such as beer with meals. This was known to be safer than water, which often came from polluted sources causing diseases. All food and drink was stored in barrels known as \"hogsheads\".[41]\nThe passenger William Mullins brought 126 pairs of shoes and 13 pairs of boots in his luggage. Other items included oiled leather and canvas suits, stuff gowns and leather and stuff breeches, shirts, jerkins, doublets, neckcloths, hats and caps, hose, stockings, belts, piece goods, and haberdasherie. At his death, his estate consisted of extensive footwear and other items of clothing, and made his daughter Priscilla and her husband John Alden quite prosperous.[19][42][43]\nNo cattle or beasts of draft or burden were brought on the journey, but there were pigs, goats, and poultry. Some passengers brought family pets such as cats and birds. Peter Browne took his large bitch mastiff, and John Goodman brought along his spaniel.[19]\nAccording to author Charles Banks, the officers and crew of the Mayflower consisted of a captain, four mates, four quartermasters, surgeon, carpenter, cooper, cooks, boatswains, gunners, and about 36 men before the mast, making a total of about 50. The entire crew stayed with the Mayflower in Plymouth through the winter of 1620\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1621, and about half of them died during that time. The remaining crewmen returned to England on the Mayflower, which sailed for London on April 5, 1621.[44][45]\nBanks states that the crew totaled 36 men before the mast and 14 officers, making a total of 50. Nathaniel Philbrick estimates between 20 and 30 sailors in her crew whose names are unknown. Nick Bunker states that Mayflower had a crew of at least 17 and possibly as many as 30. Caleb Johnson states that the ship carried a crew of about 30 men, but the exact number is unknown.[2][46][47][48]\nThree of Mayflower's owners applied to the Admiralty court for an appraisal of the ship on May 4, 1624, two years after Captain Jones' death in 1622; one of these applicants was Jones' widow Mrs. Josian (Joan) Jones. This appraisal probably was made to determine the valuation of the ship for the purpose of settling the estate of its late master. The appraisal was made by four mariners and shipwrights of Rotherhithe, home and burial place of Captain Jones, where the Mayflower was apparently then lying in the Thames at London. The appraisement is extant and provides information on ship's gear on board at that time, as well as equipment such as muskets and other arms. The ship may have been laid up since Jones' death and allowed to get out of repair, as that is what the appraisal indicates.[14][73] The vessel was valued at one hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eight shillings, and fourpence.[74]\nWhat finally became of the Mayflower is an unsettled issue. Charles Edward Banks, an English historian of the Pilgrim ship, claims that the ship was finally broken up, with her timbers used in the construction of a barn at Jordans village in Buckinghamshire. Tradition claims that this barn still exists as the Mayflower Barn, located within the grounds of Old Jordan in South Buckinghamshire. In 1624, Thomas Russell supposedly added to part of a farmhouse already there with timbers from a ship, believed to be from the Pilgrim ship Mayflower, bought from a shipbreaker's yard in Rotherhithe. The well-preserved structure was a tourist attraction, receiving visitors each year from all over the world and particularly from America, but it is now privately owned and not open to the public.[14]\nAnother ship called the Mayflower made a voyage from London to Plymouth Colony in 1629 carrying 35 passengers, many from the Pilgrim congregation in Leiden that organized the first voyage. This was not the same ship that made the original voyage with the first settlers. This voyage began in May and reached Plymouth in August. This ship also made the crossing from England to America in 1630 (as part of the Winthrop Fleet), 1633, 1634, and 1639. It attempted the trip again in 1641, departing London in October of that year under master John Cole, with 140 passengers bound for Virginia. It never arrived. On October 18, 1642, a deposition was made in England regarding the loss.[75]\nThe Pilgrim ship Mayflower has a famous place in American history as a symbol of early European colonization of the future United States.[76]\nThe main record for the voyage of the Mayflower and the disposition of the Plymouth Colony comes from the letters and journal of William Bradford, who was a guiding force and later the governor of the colony.\nThe 400th anniversary of the Mayflower sailing will take place in 2020. The Harwich Mayflower Project is hoping to build a replica of the ship at Harwich, England.[77]",

Created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore, the character made her debut in The Walking Dead #2 in 2003. In both forms of media, she is the wife of protagonist Rick Grimes and mother of Carl and Judith. The character escapes the zombie apocalypse with Carl, and Rick's partner Shane Walsh. Believing her husband to be dead, she starts a relationship with Shane.\nFor her performance as Lori, Callies was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 2010, and was among the cast members of The Walking Dead winning the Satellite Award for Best Cast - Television Series in 2012.\nLori Grimes is an average middle-class housewife living in Cynthiana, Kentucky. As the outbreak begins, she and her son, Carl, are evacuated out of the city with help from her husband Rick's best friend and work partner, Shane Walsh, in hopes of getting to where her parents live. During the evacuation, the guilt that she has been wracked with over abandoning Rick leads her to have a sexual relationship with Shane,[1] which she deeply regrets afterward.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] She continually brushes off Shane's attempts at advancing and ignores him even more when Rick miraculously arrives at their campsite.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]\nLori soon finds out, after counting her missed periods, that she is pregnant; however, she hesitates to tell anybody until after Shane's death and their move back onto the road.[1]\nLori faces typical pregnancy issues such as morning sickness and mood swings throughout the first few months of her term. She and everyone else find relative stability at an abandoned prison, with hot showers, supplies, and security.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] While at the prison, she also begins to deepen her bond with fellow survivor Carol Peletier.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] Lori is frequently concerned with the well-being of both her family and the rest of the group. After giving birth to an infant girl that she and Rick name Judith,[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] she remains extremely protective over her.\nDuring the final stages of the prison assault led by The Governor, Lori suffers a fatal shotgun blast to the back by Lilly Caul while she is carrying Judith. When Lori falls, Judith is crushed to death beneath her weight.[2]\nLori's death leaves Rick and Carl emotional wrecks. Rick suffers frightening hallucinations, both visual and auditory, at one point even using a phone to have what he believes are actual conversations with his deceased wife.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] He confides in Michonne, who has also talked to a deceased loved one to help the coping process.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] Carl frequently blames Rick for Lori and Judith's deaths.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]\nLori's husband Rick is wounded in the line of duty and left in a coma during the outbreak. Lori, believing him to be dead, takes Carl and accompanies Rick's best friend Shane as they head to Atlanta. They befriend Carol and her family while on the road, and later both groups settle with other survivors on the outskirts of Atlanta near an abandoned quarry. Lori, convinced of Rick's death by witnessing the military bomb Atlanta, eventually succumbs to her distraught state and embarks on a sexual relationship with Shane.\nRick eventually wakes from his coma, and makes his way to Atlanta, and rescued there by members of the quarry group. When Rick is brought back to the camp, he and Lori have a tearful reunion. However, Lori comes to feel guilty with her affair with Shane, and abruptly ends it, as well as discouraging Carl from hanging around Shane. The group eventually abandons the quarry to head for the CDC in Atlanta, where its one remaining scientist Dr. Jenner allows them in and enjoy the relative luxury of the facilities. During the night, a drunken Shane attempts to sexually assault Lori, but she fights him off. The group is forced to evacuate the CDC and continue on.\nRick's group is stalled by a traffic jam of cars on a highway, and Carol's daughter Sophia goes missing in the midst of a passing walker horde. Rick, Carl, and others go searching for her; Shane tells Lori during this that he plans to leave the group, getting into argument, but just then they are met by Maggie Greene from a nearby farmstead, asking for Lori as Carl had accidentally been shot, and is being cared for by her father Hershel. While Hershel is able to stabilize Carl, he lacks the equipment to remove the bullet. Shane goes with Hershel's farmhand Otis to get supplies from a nearby school, invested with walkers. Shane shoots Otis purposely to give him time to escape, but does not tell this to the others when he returns with the supplies, but this leaves him with an emotional scar, and he shaves his head, partially to hide the clump of hair Otis had torn out from it; these actions trouble Lori.\nLori feels some illness as Carl recovers, and discretely asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test on his next supply run. The test turns up positive, and Lori fears that her child may be Shane's and not Rick's. Again she confides in Glenn about this, and asks him to get her some \"morning after\" pills on his next run. Once she has them, she tries to take them, but has last-second thoughts and spits them out. Rick discovers the box for the pills and confronts her about it. She admits to being pregnant, and having a affair with Shane when she had no idea Rick was alive, and fears how they can raise a child into this world. Rick helps her come to terms, and she decides she will keep the child and she and Rick will raise it as their own, regardless of who the father was. Lori's pregnancy comes out to the rest of the group, and creates a rift between Shane and Rick over who fathered the child that creations tension throughout the group.\nLater, Rick and Glenn go off to look for Hershel but don't return after a while. Concerned, Lori goes to look for them but gets into an accident. Shane comes and rescues her, claiming Rick had returned, thus giving Shane the time to talk about his true feelings for Lori, and that they should be together. Once back at the farm, Lori talks to Dale, learning that he feels Shane is progressively becoming paranoid and he believes that Shane likely killed Otis at the school. Later, Lori helps Maggie to stop Maggie's sister Beth from committing suicide. When Dale is attacked by a walker and the group forced to euthanize him, Lori apologizes to Shane for how she had been treating him.\nEvents at the farm lead to a confrontation between Rick and Shane, and Rick is forced to kill Shane when Shane attacks him. In the aftermath, a horde of walkers, drawn by gunfire, swarm the farmstead, and Rick's group is forced to abandon it. As they regroup on the highway, Lori learns of the circumstances around Shane's death, and becomes troubled by Rick's actions.\nOver the next several months, Lori finds that both Rick and Carl have grown distant from her. Lori is near the end of her pregnancy as the group finds an abandoned prison they decide to clear out for their own. They deal with roaming walkers as well as five living prisoners, two who quickly fall into line with the group, but the others they are forced to kill, while Rick leaves the fifth, Andrew, outside in a pack of walkers, though unknown to them, Andrew manages to escape. Lori fears that the baby may have rotated in her womb to make normal childbirth impossible, and has the group practice Caesarean section on dispatched walkers. Sometime later, Andrew lures a group of walkers back to the prison to get his revenge. The group is forced to scatter as the walkers flood; the fright causes Lori to enter into labor, and she, Carl, and Maggie take shelter in a boiler room. Lori's fears are affirmed about the birth, and she instructs Maggie to perform an improvised Cesarean section on her, knowing that without painkillers or anesthetic, this will likely be fatal for her. She says her goodbyes to Carl before Maggie starts. Lori's daughter is recovered alive, but as she expected, Lori succumbs to the procedure. Carl insists on being the one to put down Lori before she can reanimate. Maggie and Carl take the baby outside once the walkers have been cleared, and Rick, on seeing the child but not Lori, breaks down. He races to the boiler room, and sees a bloated walker that he believes ate Lori's body, and stabs it over an over. Rick starts having hallucinations of Lori and other survivors that had previously died, leading to him struggling to keep leadership of the group.\nAs the group deals with attacks from The Governor from the nearby Woodbury community, Rick struggles with continuous visions of Lori, which makes him doubt his abilities as a leader. However, he eventually makes a stand against the Governor, reunited his group, and finds that he no longer sees visions of Lori. He accepts her daughter, which Carl named Judith, as his own, despite believing that she may have been fathered by Shane.\nLori Grimes is portrayed by Sarah Wayne Callies, who was cast in the series in April 2010.[3] Callies saw an issue of the comic book series while at a bookstore in Vancouver. \"I was looking through for the latest issue that had just come out and the owner of the comic book store came up to me and said, 'I see you're checking out The Walking Dead,\" she stated. \"It's amazing.' I said, 'Yeah, I'm a huge fan.' And he said, 'You know they're making a television show for AMC. It's supposed to be really good.' I kind of looked at him and I froze. I just went, 'I'll keep an eye out for it.' And I ran out of the store.\"[4]\nIn the comics, Kirkman resolved the love triangle between Lori, Shane, and Rick very quickly, but in the TV show he decided to spend more time exploring this relationship.[5]\nCallies was in favor of Lori dying while in the Prison, just like the comic character. In an interview she stated, \"I argued that it was necessary to kill Lori and I feel very strongly that for all of the other deviations we may have from the comic book, killing Lori does something to Rick that is vital for the story and can't be done any other way.\"[6]\nRegarding the television adaptation of the character, Lori received generally negative reviews, with Sarah Wayne Callies' performance receiving a mixed response from critics. Critics were polarized with the characters' reaction to Lori opting for an abortion in the episode \"Secrets\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen criticized the character's opposing views on the matter, and stated that their reasoning was invalid. Handlen wrote. \"I'm not even sure it would be possible for her to abort the pregnancy at this point, but the show's working on the assumption that having a child in a world where death literally lurks around every corner is an unequivocal good. The only person who\u2019s been anti-pregnancy is Lori, and the show hasn't managed to cast her in a very good light, so it\u2019s not like her arguments hold much water\u2014which is also ridiculous, because ultimately, her opinion is the only one that matters.\"[7] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and stated that Rick's arguments against Lori's attempts were obsolete.[8]\nThe love triangle involving Lori, Rick, and Shane, however, was commended. Meslow felt that the interactions between Lori and Rick possessed \"as much rawness and honesty as could be hoped for.\"[9]\nCommentators criticized the character development of Lori Grimes in the episode \"Nebraska\". Eric Goldman for IGN was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development intended for the scene. He stated, \"The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted as she looked at a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, but it could have been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all.\"[10] Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club thought that the foundation set up for furthering the storyline progression was contrived,[11] while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense.[12]\nCritics were divided upon the interaction between Rick and Lori after she discovers Shane had died. Commentators were critical of the performance of Sarah Wayne Callies. Although The Huffington Post's Maureen Ryan reacted positively to Lincoln's performance, she affirmed that the contradictory nature of Lori almost ruined the scene.[13] Similarly, New York's Starlee Kine criticized Callies' facial expressions during the sequence.[14] Josh Jackson, who writes for Paste wrote, \"If that was a challenge from the writers, though, Sarah Wayne Callies has to feel like they're just messing with her at this point. Her character, Lori, basically tells Rick that Shane needs to be put down, and then treats him like a monster when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forced to follow through with it.\"[15]\nThe fates of Lori and the character of T-Dog in the episode \"Killer Within\" garnered favorable reviews from television commentators. According to HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall, the moment when Lori and Carl share their goodbyes was the most heartbreaking event since the ending of the second season episode \"Pretty Much Dead Already\".[16] Los Angeles Times columnist Laura Hudson felt it was a grim departure for a character who endured long bouts of grief for reasons beyond her control.[17] Erik Kain from Forbes magazine found Lori's death especially difficult to watch, and was shocked by T-Dog's \"sudden\" death despite the fact that he \"was never as prominent a figure\" on the program. \"As hard as these deaths were to watch,\" Kain wrote, \"they also give me faith in the show.\"[18] Even though he stated that T-Dog died \"a hero's death\", Michael Rapoport of the Wall Street Journal concluded that Lori's \"gut-churning\" demise was the more memorable.[19]\nLori's demise was featured in The Huffington Post's list of \"The Biggest 'OMG' TV Moments of 2012\",[20] and placed nineteenth in Slate's article covering the year's most noteworthy television moments. Journalist Chris Kirk said that the segment was \"utterly surprising\", and pointed out that the writers beguiled viewers by shedding light onto Lori's crumbled relationship with Rick.[21] In contrast, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club in his review felt the episode \"stumble[d]\" in how [...] Lori [was] eliminated and in how the Woodbury storyline repeated what was already known. Handlen commented in his B+ review that \"killing [...] Lori earned the show an immediate thrill, but it also meant crossing off [a] potential source[...] of drama, [someone] who had a history on the series, however thin or poorly developed that history might have been.\"[22]\nSarah Wayne Callies' performance in the episode was unanimously praised, however. IGN writer Eric Goldman commended Callies[23] Sepinwall added that Callies \"absolutely sold\" the portrayal of a mother saying \"goodbye to the son who had to grow up much too quickly\".[8]",

        "text": "The Blacklist is an American crime thriller television series that premiered on NBC on September 23, 2013. Raymond \"Red\" Reddington (James Spader), a former U.S. Navy officer turned high-profile criminal, voluntarily surrenders to the FBI after eluding capture for decades. He tells the FBI that he has a list of the most dangerous criminals in the world that he has compiled over the years and is willing to inform on their operations in exchange for immunity from prosecution. However, he insists on working exclusively with a rookie FBI profiler by the name of Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone). The series also stars Diego Klattenhoff, Ryan Eggold, and Harry Lennix. The pilot episode was written by Jon Bokenkamp and directed by Joe Carnahan.[1] Executive producers for the series include Bokenkamp, John Eisendrath, and John Davis for Sony Pictures Television, Universal Television, and Davis Entertainment.\nOn October 4, 2013, NBC ordered nine additional episodes, filling out the series' first season.[2] On December 3, 2013, NBC renewed the series for a 22-episode second season.[3] On May 11, 2014, owing to the series' breakout success, NBC decided to air an episode in the coveted post\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSuper Bowl timeslot in 2015.[4] On December 5, 2015, the series was renewed for a fourth season, which premiered on September 22, 2016.[5][6] A spin-off series, The Blacklist: Redemption, premiered on February 23, 2017. On May 11, 2017, the series was renewed for a fifth season,[7] while the spin-off was canceled the following day.[8] The fifth season premiered on September 27, 2017.[9]\nThe series has received positive reviews,[10][11] with many critics praising Spader's performance in particular.[12]\nRaymond \"Red\" Reddington, a former US Naval Intelligence officer who had disappeared twenty years earlier to become one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, surrenders himself to FBI Assistant Director Harold Cooper at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. Taken to an FBI \"black site\", Reddington claims he wishes to help the FBI track down and apprehend the criminals and terrorists he spent the last twenty years associating with; individuals that are so dangerous and devious that the United States government is unaware of their very existence.\nHe offers Cooper his knowledge and assistance on two conditions: immunity from prosecution, and that he wants to work exclusively with Elizabeth Keen, a rookie profiler newly assigned to Cooper. Keen and Cooper are suspicious of Reddington's interest in her, but he will only say that she is \"very special\". After Cooper tests Reddington's offer in locating and killing a terrorist in the first episode, Reddington reveals that this man was only the first on his \"blacklist\" of global criminals, which he has compiled over his criminal career, and states that he and the FBI have a mutual interest in eliminating them. The mysteries of Reddington's and Liz's lives, and his interest in her, are gradually revealed as the series progresses. Each episode features one of the global criminals, and Reddington assisting the team tracking and apprehending them.\nThe rank and name or alias of the featured criminal on the list is displayed at the start of every episode. Three episodes in the series, \"Cape May,\" \"Requiem,\" and \"Ruin\", do not follow this format.\nAfter showing a screening of the pilot at Comic-Con, producers revealed that their inspiration for The Blacklist came from the capture of Whitey Bulger.[18] Recalling the experience in an interview with Collider.com, executive producer John Eisendrath stated:\nNBC bought the rights to The Blacklist from Sony Pictures Television in August 2012[20] and greenlighted the show in January 2013.[21] During an NBC upfront presentation in May 2013, it was announced that The Blacklist was NBC's highest-testing drama in 10 years.[22]\nEisendrath said the casting process was difficult.[19] In February 2013, NBC offered Kiefer Sutherland the lead role of Raymond Reddington.[23] After considering other actors for the role, Eisendrath and Bokenkamp called James Spader to see if he would be interested in it.[19] Feeling confident in Spader's understanding of the character, they cast him three days before filming began.[19]\nMegan Boone took a week to prepare for her audition as FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen.[24] Feeling like her initial audition was one of the better auditions of her career, Boone later was called back for multiple auditions.[24] In March 2013, Deadline.com reported that Boone accepted the role as the female lead in the series.[25]\nDespite being set in Washington, D.C., the series is mainly filmed in the same Manhattan studio where Law & Order was filmed for 20 years.[26] Producer Richard Heus said they chose to film specific Washington, D.C. locations for the series, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, and the National Mall, because they were \"iconic American locations\".[27]\nThe series is filmed in 4K using Sony PMW-F55 cameras that are adapted to use Panavision lenses.[28] It is edited using Avid Media Composer, and editor Christopher Brookshire says the show has \"a very distinctive look and pace\".[29] An average of three cameras are used at one time, but as many as six cameras are sometimes rolling.[30]\nThe series is broadcast simultaneously on Global in Canada.[31][32] In New Zealand, the show premiered on TV3 on February 2, 2014.[33] The second season premiered on September 23.[34] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the show premiered on Sky Living on October 4, 2013.[35] The second season premiered on October 3, 2014.[36] Netflix has streaming rights to seasons 1\u20135 in the United States, 1\u20134 in Australia, Latin America, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Canada.[citation needed]\nThe first season of The Blacklist received strong reviews from television critics. On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[37] On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season received a rating of 83%, based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The consensus reads, \"James Spader is riveting as a criminal-turned-informant, and his presence goes a long way toward making this twisty but occasionally implausible crime procedural compelling\".[38] The second season received a rating of 80%, based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The consensus reads, \"Though The Blacklist flirts with narrative overload, it's held together by James Spader's scenery-eating performance and wildly entertaining action.\"[39] The third season received a rating of 93%, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus reads, \"The Blacklist is back in top form with fresh dangers that put Red on the ropes while giving James Spader room to shine.\"[40] The fourth season received a rating of 86%, based on seven reviews, with an average rating of 7/10.[41] The fifth season received a rating of 100%, based on five reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10.[42]\nDavid Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said about the pilot, \"You think you know this situation and how it will turn out, but there are surprising, yet entirely credible, twists throughout Monday's episode\".[10] Robert Bianco of USA Today said, \"The Blacklist is a solid weekly crime show built around a genuine TV star. That's the kind of series the networks have to be able to pull off to survive. And with Spader in command, odds are NBC will\".[43] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised both Spader's performance and the procedural elements of the show, writing \"there's an overarching element to the premise as well that makes it intriguing without making it overly complicated.\"[44]\nTitan Books released an official comic book series based on the series, written by Nicole Phillips and drawn by Beni Lobel. The series' crew is working in the project as well.\nEditor David Leach told The Hollywood Reporter that the comic is \"a true extension of the television series\" giving \"new dimensions of the characters that have captured the audiences worldwide\". The series will open with a six-issue story arc, which will be \"a journey deep into the dark world of international espionage, conspiracies and intrigue on a global scale\".\nIssue #1 was launched July 22, 2015, in both comic book and digital stores.[63]\nA mobile game by Gameloft based on the series, The Blacklist: Conspiracy, was released on June 23, 2016, for Android, iOS and Windows devices.[64] The game consists of the player as a member of the task force. Players can interact with Reddington and Cooper, other members of the task force, as well as interrogate potential suspects and witnesses. The game mainly consists of searching for missing items in different environments, as well as mini games to further the investigations. Players can also make decisions that alter the route of the story.[65]\nIn March 2016, NBC began developing a spin-off series created by Bokenkamp and Eisendrath, who would also serve as executive producers with Davis and Fox. The project was set to star Famke Janssen as Susan \"Scottie\" Hargrave (formerly Halsted) and Eggold, in his role as Tom Keen, as well as Edi Gathegi reprising his role as Matias Solomon. Tawny Cypress has been cast as Nez Rowan, a character already recurring during the third season.[66] Hargrave first appeared on The Blacklist episode \"Susan Hargrave\", with \"Alexander Kirk\" serving as a backdoor pilot for the potential series. That episode was written by Bokenkamp and Eisendrath and directed by Michael Dinner.[67] On May 14, 2016, a pilot for the series, The Blacklist: Redemption, was ordered.[68] The series was canceled after one season,[69] and Eggold will continue his role on The Blacklist.[70]",

        "text": "The Good Doctor is an American medical drama television series based on the 2013 award-winning South Korean series of the same name. Daniel Dae Kim, the actor, first noticed the series and bought the rights for his production company. He began adapting the series and eventually shopped it to CBS, his home network in 2015. CBS decided against creating a pilot. Because Kim felt so strongly about the series, he bought back the rights from CBS. Eventually, Sony Pictures Television and Kim worked out a deal and brought on David Shore, creator of the Fox hit medical drama, House, to develop the series.[1]\nThe show is produced by Sony Pictures Television and ABC Studios, in association with production companies Shore Z Productions, 3AD, and Entermedia. David Shore serves as showrunner and Daniel Dae Kim is an executive producer for the show.\nThe series stars Freddie Highmore as Shaun Murphy, a young savant autistic surgical resident at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. Antonia Thomas, Nicholas Gonzalez, Beau Garrett, Hill Harper, Richard Schiff, and Tamlyn Tomita also star in the show. The series received a put pilot commitment at ABC after a previous attempted series did not move forward at CBS Television Studios in 2015; The Good Doctor was ordered to series in May 2017. On October 3, 2017, ABC picked up the series for a full season of 18 episodes. The series is primarily filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. In March 2018, ABC renewed the series for a second season.\nThe series debuted on September 25, 2017. The Good Doctor has received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise given to Highmore's performance, and strong television ratings.\nThe series follows Shaun Murphy, a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome from the mid-size city of Casper, Wyoming, where he had a troubled childhood. He relocates to San Jose, California, to work at the prestigious San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.[2]\nIn May 2014, CBS Television Studios began development on an American remake of the hit South Korean medical drama Good Doctor with Daniel Dae Kim as producer. Kim explained the appeal of adapting the series as \"something that can fit into a recognizable world, with a breadth of characters that can be explored in the long run\".[37] The story of a pediatric surgeon with autism was to be set in Boston and projected to air in August 2015.[38][39] However, CBS did not pick up the project and it moved to Sony Pictures Television, with a put pilot commitment from ABC in October 2016. The series is developed by David Shore, who is executive producing alongside Kim, Sebastian Lee, and David Kim.[40] ABC officially ordered the series to pilot in January 2017.[41]\nOn May 11, 2017, ABC ordered the show to series as a co-production with Sony Pictures Television and ABC Studios,[42] and it was officially picked up for a full season of 18 episodes on October 3, 2017.[43] On March 7, 2018, ABC renewed the series for a second season.[44] It will premiere in the fall of 2018\nOn February 17, 2017, Antonia Thomas was cast as Dr. Claire Browne, a strong-willed and talented doctor who forms a special connection with Shaun.[5] A week later, Freddie Highmore was cast in the lead role as Dr. Shaun Murphy, a young surgeon with autism; and Nicholas Gonzalez was cast as Dr. Neil Melendez, the boss of the surgical residents at the hospital.[3] The next month, Chuku Modu was cast as resident Dr. Jared Kalu (originally Dr. Jared Unger);[6] Hill Harper as head of surgery Dr. Marcus Andrews (originally Dr. Horace Andrews); Irene Keng as resident Dr. Elle McLean;[8] and Richard Schiff was cast as Dr. Aaron Glassman (originally Dr. Ira Glassman), the hospital president and Shaun's mentor.[9][42] Schiff was shortly followed by Beau Garrett as hospital board member Jessica Preston and a friend of Dr. Glassman.[7] In September 2017, Tamlyn Tomita was promoted to the principal cast as Allegra Aoki.[11]\nIn April 2018, it was revealed that Will Yun Lee, Fiona Gubelmann, Christina Chang, and Paige Spara had been promoted to series regulars for the second season, after recurring in the first as Alex, Morgan, Audrey, and Lea, respectively.[45] In addition, it was announced that Modu would not return for the second season.[45]\nProduction on the pilot took place from March 21 to April 6, 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia.[47][48] Filming for the rest of the season began on July 26, 2017, and concluded on March 1, 2018.[49]\nDan Romer serves as the primary composer for the series.[50]\nThe Good Doctor began airing on September 25, 2017, on ABC in the United States,[51] and on CTV in Canada.[52] Sky Living acquired the broadcast rights for the United Kingdom and Ireland.[53] Seven Network airs the series in Australia.[54] Wowow, the largest Japanese private satellite and pay-per-view television network in Japan acquired the rights to broadcast the series beginning in April 2018.[55] In the Netherlands, the series began airing on January 29, 2018, on RTL 4 and on video-on-demand service Videoland.[56]\nA full-length trailer was released for ABC's May 2017 Upfront presentation, which /Film's Ethan Anderton described the concept as feeling like \"House meets Rain Man, that just might be enough to make it interesting\". However, he questioned \"how long can audiences be entranced by both the brilliance of [Highmore's] character's savant skills and the difficulties that come from his autism in the workplace.\"[57] Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer was \"both kinda progressive and really dated\". He added, \"Too much felt on-the-nose\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially Hill Harper as the main character's detractor and Richard Schiff as his noble defender\", while also commentating that \"On-the-nose/premise is how you have to trailer a show like this, and maybe spaced out over 43 minutes it won't grate.\"[58] Ben Travers and Steve Greene for IndieWire called it \"a serious trailer for a serious subject. The first glimpse of Highmore's character hints that they're toeing the line between presenting a thoughtful depiction of his condition and using his perceptive abilities as a kind of secret weapon.\"[59] The trailer had been viewed over 25.4 million times after a week of its release, including over 22 million views on Facebook.[60]\nThe pilot was screened at ABC's PaleyFest event on September 9, 2017.[61] On March 22, 2018, members of the cast as well as executive producers Shore and Kim attended the 35th annual PaleyFest LA to promote the series, along with a screening of the season finale of the first season.[62]\nThe series premiere earned a 2.2/9 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, with 11.22 million total viewers, making it the most watched Monday drama debut on ABC in 21 years, since Dangerous Minds in September 1996, and the highest rated Monday drama in the 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c49 demographic in 8.5 years, since Castle in March 2009.[81] Factoring live plus seven-day ratings, the pilot was watched by a total of 19.2 million viewers and set a record for DVR viewers with 7.9 million, surpassing the record of 7.67 million set by the pilot of Designated Survivor in 2016.[82] According to TV Guide's November 13-26 issue, the October 9 episode attracted 18.2 million viewers, beating out both NCIS and The Big Bang Theory for the most viewed primetime show that week.[83]\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 58% approval rating with an average rating of 5.49/10 based on 38 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"The Good Doctor's heavy-handed bedside manner undermines a solid lead performance, but under all the emotionally manipulative gimmickry, there's still plenty of room to improve.\"[84] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 53 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[85]\nGiving his first impression of the series' pilot for TVLine, Matt Webb Mitovich stated, \"The Good Doctor boasts great DNA... [and] has the potential to be a refreshingly thought-provoking hospital drama, based on the buttons pushed in the pilot alone.\" He enjoyed the \"warm dynamic\" of Schiff and Highmore, while describing Thomas' character as \"our emotional 'in' to Shaun's distinct, distant world\". He noted that \"it takes a while to build up momentum\", but concluded that \"the very final scene packs quite a punch, as Dr. Murphy unwittingly puts a colleague on notice\".[86]\nThe New York Times television critic, James Poniewozik, notes in his Critic's Notebook column, that for the most part the drama is a \"hospital melodrama with whiz-bang medical science, a dash of intra-staff romance and shameless sentimentality.\" Discussing the main characters of Dr. Aaron Glassman (Richard Schiff) and Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), however, Poniewozik writes that \"Mr. Schiff is convincing in the role and Mr. Highmore is striking in his.\" [87]\nSpeaking of Freddie Highmore's Golden Globe nomination on Monday, December 11, 2017, for his role in The Good Doctor, Laura Bradley, writing for Vanity Fair says: \"... Freddie Highmore received the awards recognition that has long and unjustly eluded him...\" Bradley feels that Highmore's performance has been \"the central key\" to the show's enormous success and while the show had lukewarm reviews, most critics have praised Highmore's work.

        "text": "In nuclear physics, beta decay (\u03b2-decay) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray (fast energetic electron or positron) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus. For example, beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron, or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron (positron emission), thus changing the nuclide type. Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process. By this process, unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons. The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy. The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability.[1] For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible, the energy release (see below) or Q value must be positive.\nBeta decay is a consequence of the weak force, which is characterized by relatively lengthy decay times. Nucleons are composed of up or down quarks,[2] and the weak force allows a quark to change type by the exchange of a W boson and the creation of an electron/antineutrino or positron/neutrino pair. For example, a neutron, composed of two down quarks and an up quark, decays to a proton composed of a down quark and two up quarks. Decay times for many nuclides that are subject to beta decay can be thousands of years.\nElectron capture is sometimes included as a type of beta decay,[3] because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the weak force, is the same. In electron capture, an inner atomic electron is captured by a proton in the nucleus, transforming it into a neutron, and an electron neutrino is released.\nThe two types of beta decay are known as beta minus and beta plus. In beta minus (\u03b2\u2212) decay, a neutron is converted to a proton and the process creates an electron and an electron antineutrino; while in beta plus (\u03b2+) decay, a proton is converted to a neutron and the process creates a positron and an electron neutrino. \u03b2+ decay is also known as positron emission.[4]\nBeta decay conserves a quantum number known as the lepton number, or the number of electrons and their associated neutrinos (other leptons are the muon and tau particles). These particles have lepton number +1, while their antiparticles have lepton number \u22121. Since a proton or neutron has lepton number zero, \u03b2+ decay (a positron, or antielectron) must be accompanied with an electron neutrino, while \u03b2\u2212 decay (an electron) must be accompanied by an electron antineutrino.\nAn example of electron emission (\u03b2\u2212 decay) is the decay of carbon-14 into nitrogen-14 with a half-life of about 5,730 years:\nIn this form of decay, the original element becomes a new chemical element in a process known as nuclear transmutation. This new element has an unchanged mass number A, but an atomic number Z that is increased by one. As in all nuclear decays, the decaying element (in this case 14\n6C) is known as the parent nuclide while the resulting element (in this case 14\n7N) is known as the daughter nuclide.\nAn example of positron emission is the decay of magnesium-23 into sodium-23 with a half-life of about 11.3 s:\n\u00ce\u00b2+ decay also results in nuclear transmutation, with the resulting element having an atomic number that is decreased by one.\nThe beta spectrum, or distribution of energy values for the beta particles, is continuous. The total energy of the decay process is divided between the electron, the antineutrino, and the recoiling nuclide. In the figure to the right, an example of an electron with 0.40 MeV energy from the beta decay of 210Bi is shown. In this example, the total decay energy is 1.16 MeV, so the antineutrino has the remaining energy: 1.16-0.40=0.76 MeV. An electron at the far right of the curve would have the maximum possible kinetic energy, leaving the energy of the neutrino to be only its small rest mass.\nRadioactivity was discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel in uranium, and subsequently observed by Marie and Pierre Curie in thorium and in the new elements polonium and radium. In 1899, Ernest Rutherford separated radioactive emissions into two types: alpha and beta (now beta minus), based on penetration of objects and ability to cause ionization. Alpha rays could be stopped by thin sheets of paper or aluminium, whereas beta rays could penetrate several millimetres of aluminium. In 1900, Paul Villard identified a still more penetrating type of radiation, which Rutherford identified as a fundamentally new type in 1903 and termed gamma rays. Alpha, beta, and gamma are the first three letters of the Greek alphabet.\nIn 1900, Becquerel measured the mass-to-charge ratio (m/e) for beta particles by the method of J.J.\u00c2\u00a0Thomson used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that m/e for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson's electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron.[5]\nIn 1901, Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed that alpha and beta radioactivity involves the transmutation of atoms into atoms of other chemical elements. In 1913, after the products of more radioactive decays were known, Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans independently proposed their radioactive displacement law, which states that beta (i.e., \u03b2\u2212)\u00a0emission from one element produces another element one place to the right in the periodic table, while alpha emission produces an element two places to the left.\nThe study of beta decay provided the first physical evidence for the existence of the neutrino. In both alpha and gamma decay, the resulting particle has a narrow energy distribution, since the particle carries the energy from the difference between the initial and final nuclear states. However, the kinetic energy distribution, or spectrum, of beta particles measured by Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in 1911 and by Jean Danysz in 1913 showed multiple lines on a diffuse background. These measurements offered the first hint that beta particles have a continuous spectrum.[6] In 1914, James Chadwick used a magnetic spectrometer with one of Hans Geiger's new counters to make more accurate measurements which showed that the spectrum was continuous.[6][7] The distribution of beta particle energies was in apparent contradiction to the law of conservation of energy. If beta decay were simply electron emission as assumed at the time, then the energy of the emitted electron should have a particular, well-defined value.[8] For beta decay, however, the observed broad distribution of energies suggested that energy is lost in the beta decay process. This spectrum was puzzling for many years.\nA second problem is related to the conservation of angular momentum. Molecular band spectra showed that the nuclear spin of nitrogen-14 is 1 (i.e. equal to the reduced Planck constant) and more generally that the spin is integral for nuclei of even mass number and half-integral for nuclei of odd mass number. This was later explained by the proton-neutron model of the nucleus.[8] Beta decay leaves the mass number unchanged, so the change of nuclear spin must be an integer. However, the electron spin is 1/2, hence angular momentum would not be conserved if beta decay were simply electron emission.\nFrom 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1927, Charles Drummond Ellis (along with Chadwick and colleagues) further established that the beta decay spectrum is continuous. In 1933, Ellis and Nevill Mott obtained strong evidence that the beta spectrum has an effective upper bound in energy. Niels Bohr had suggested that the beta spectrum could be explained if conservation of energy was true only in a statistical sense, thus this principle might be violated in any given decay.[8]:27 However, the upper bound in beta energies determined by Ellis and Mott ruled out that notion. Now, the problem of how to account for the variability of energy in known beta decay products, as well as for conservation of momentum and angular momentum in the process, became acute.\nIn a famous letter written in 1930, Wolfgang Pauli attempted to resolve the beta-particle energy conundrum by suggesting that, in addition to electrons and protons, atomic nuclei also contained an extremely light neutral particle, which he called the neutron. He suggested that this \"neutron\" was also emitted during beta decay (thus accounting for the known missing energy, momentum, and angular momentum), but it had simply not yet been observed. In 1931, Enrico Fermi renamed Pauli's \"neutron\" the \"neutrino\" (roughly 'little neutral one' in Italian). In 1934, Fermi published his landmark theory for beta decay, where he applied the principles of quantum mechanics to matter particles, supposing that they can be created and annihilated, just as the light quanta in atomic transitions. Thus, according to Fermi, neutrinos are created in the beta-decay process, rather than contained in the nucleus; the same happens to electrons. The neutrino interaction with matter was so weak that detecting it proved a severe experimental challenge. Further indirect evidence of the existence of the neutrino was obtained by observing the recoil of nuclei that emitted such a particle after absorbing an electron. Neutrinos were finally detected directly in 1956 by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in the Cowan\u2013Reines neutrino experiment.[9] The properties of neutrinos were (with a few minor modifications) as predicted by Pauli and Fermi.\nIn 1934, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie bombarded aluminium with alpha particles to effect the nuclear reaction 4\n2He\u00a0+\u00a027\n13Al\u00a0\u2192 30\n15P\u00a0+\u00a01\n0n, and observed that the product isotope 30\n15P emits a positron identical to those found in cosmic rays (discovered by Carl David Anderson in 1932). This was the first example of \u03b2+\u00a0decay (positron emission), which they termed artificial radioactivity since 30\n15P is a short-lived nuclide which does not exist in nature. In recognition of their discovery the couple were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935[10].\nThe theory of electron capture was first discussed by Gian-Carlo Wick in a 1934 paper, and then developed by Hideki Yukawa and others. K-electron capture was first observed in 1937 by Luis Alvarez, in the nuclide 48V.[11][12][13] Alvarez went on to study electron capture in 67Ga and other nuclides.[11][14][15]\nIn 1956, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang noticed that there was no evidence that parity was conserved in weak interactions, and so they postulated that this symmetry may not be preserved by the weak force. They sketched the design for an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory.[16] Later that year, Chien-Shiung Wu and coworkers conducted the Wu experiment showing an asymmetrical beta decay of cobalt-60 at cold temperatures that proved that parity is not conserved in beta decay.[17][18] This surprising result overturned long-held assumptions about parity and the weak force. In recognition of their theoretical work, Lee and Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1957.[19]\nIn \u03b2\u2212\u00a0decay, the weak interaction converts an atomic nucleus into a nucleus with atomic number increased by one, while emitting an electron (e\u2212) and an electron antineutrino (\u03bd\ne). \u03b2\u2212\u00a0decay generally occurs in neutron-rich nuclei.[20] The generic equation is:\nwhere A and Z are the mass number and atomic number of the decaying nucleus, and X and X' are the initial and final elements, respectively.\nAnother example is when the free neutron (1\n0n) decays by \u03b2\u2212\u00a0decay into a proton (p):\nAt the fundamental level (as depicted in the Feynman diagram on the right), this is caused by the conversion of the negatively charged (\u22121/3\u00a0e) down quark to the positively charged (+2/3\u00a0e) up quark by emission of a W\u2212 boson; the W\u2212 boson subsequently decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino:\nIn \u03b2+\u00a0decay, or \"positron emission\", the weak interaction converts an atomic nucleus into a nucleus with atomic number decreased by one, while emitting a positron (e+) and an electron neutrino (\u03bd\ne). \u03b2+\u00a0decay generally occurs in proton-rich nuclei. The generic equation is:\nThis may be considered as the decay of a proton inside the nucleus to a neutron\nHowever, \u03b2+\u00a0decay cannot occur in an isolated proton because it requires energy due to the mass of the neutron being greater than the mass of the proton. \u03b2+\u00a0decay can only happen inside nuclei when the daughter nucleus has a greater binding energy (and therefore a lower total energy) than the mother nucleus. The difference between these energies goes into the reaction of converting a proton into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino and into the kinetic energy of these particles. This process is opposite to negative beta decay, in that the weak interaction converts a proton into a neutron by converting an up quark into a down quark resulting in the emission of a W+ or the absorption of a W\u2212.\nIn all cases where \u03b2+\u00a0decay (positron emission) of a nucleus is allowed energetically, so too is electron capture allowed. This is a process during which a nucleus captures one of its atomic electrons, resulting in the emission of a neutrino:\nAn example of electron capture is one of the decay modes of krypton-81 into bromine-81:\nAll emitted neutrinos are of the same energy. In proton-rich nuclei where the energy difference between the initial and final states is less than 2mec2, \u03b2+\u00a0decay is not energetically possible, and electron capture is the sole decay mode.[21]\nIf the captured electron comes from the innermost shell of the atom, the K-shell, which has the highest probability to interact with the nucleus, the process is called K-capture.[22] If it comes from the L-shell, the process is called L-capture, etc.\nElectron capture is a competing (simultaneous) decay process for all nuclei that can undergo \u00ce\u00b2+ decay. The converse, however, is not true: electron capture is the only type of decay that is allowed in proton-rich nuclides that do not have sufficient energy to emit a positron and neutrino.[21]\nIf the proton and neutron are part of an atomic nucleus, the above described decay processes transmute one chemical element into another. For example:\nBeta decay does not change the number\u00a0(A) of nucleons in the nucleus, but changes only its charge\u00a0Z. Thus the set of all nuclides with the same\u00a0A can be introduced; these isobaric nuclides may turn into each other via beta decay. For a given A there is one that is most stable. It is said to be beta stable, because it presents a local minima of the mass excess: if such a nucleus has (A, Z) numbers, the neighbour nuclei (A, Z\u22121) and (A, Z+1) have higher mass excess and can beta decay into (A, Z), but not vice versa. For all odd mass numbers A, there is only one known beta-stable isobar. For even\u00a0A, there are up to three different beta-stable isobars experimentally known; for example, 96\n40Zr, 96\n42Mo, and 96\n44Ru are all beta-stable. There are about 355 known beta-decay stable nuclides.[23]\nUsually, unstable nuclides are clearly either \"neutron rich\" or \"proton rich\", with the former undergoing beta decay and the latter undergoing electron capture (or more rarely, due to the higher energy requirements, positron decay). However, in a few cases of odd-proton, odd-neutron radionuclides, it may be energetically favorable for the radionuclide to decay to an even-proton, even-neutron isobar either by undergoing beta-positive or beta-negative decay. An often-cited example is the single isotope 64\n29Cu (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which illustrates three types of beta decay in competition. Copper-64 has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost equally likely to decay through proton decay by positron emission (18%) or electron capture (43%) to 64\n28Ni, as it is through neutron decay by electron emission (39%) to 64\n30Zn.[24]\nMost naturally occurring nuclides on earth are beta stable. Those that are not have half-lives ranging from under a second to periods of time significantly greater than the age of the universe. One common example of a long-lived isotope is the odd-proton odd-neutron nuclide 40\n19K, which undergoes all three types of beta decay (\u03b2\u2212, \u03b2+ and electron capture) with a half-life of 7016402990552000000\u26601.277\u00d7109\u00a0years.[25]\nBeta decay just changes neutron to proton or, in the case of positive beta decay (electron capture) proton to neutron so the number of individual quarks don't change. It is only the baryon flavor that changes, here labelled as the isospin.\nUp and down quarks have total isospin \n\n\n\nI\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I={\\frac {1}{2}}}\n\n and isospin projections\nAll other quarks have I\u00a0=\u00a00.\nso all leptons have assigned a value of +1, antileptons \u00e2\u02c6\u20191, and non-leptonic particles 0.\nFor allowed decays, the net orbital angular momentum is zero, hence only spin quantum numbers are considered.\nThe electron and antineutrino are fermions, spin-1/2 objects, therefore they may couple to total \n\n\n\nS\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=1}\n\n (parallel) or \n\n\n\nS\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=0}\n\n (anti-parallel).\nFor forbidden decays, orbital angular momentum must also be taken into consideration.\nThe Q value is defined as the total energy released in a given nuclear decay. In beta decay, Q is therefore also the sum of the kinetic energies of the emitted beta particle, neutrino, and recoiling nucleus. (Because of the large mass of the nucleus compared to that of the beta particle and neutrino, the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus can generally be neglected.) Beta particles can therefore be emitted with any kinetic energy ranging from 0 to Q.[1] A typical Q is around 1\u00c2\u00a0MeV, but can range from a few keV to a few tens of MeV.\nSince the rest mass of the electron is 511\u00a0keV, the most energetic beta particles are ultrarelativistic, with speeds very close to the speed of light.\nConsider the generic equation for beta decay\nThe Q value for this decay is\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nm\n\nN\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{N}\\left({\\ce {^{\\mathit {A}}_{\\mathit {Z}}X}}\\right)}\n\n is the mass of the nucleus of the A\nZX atom, \n\n\n\n\nm\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{e}}\n\n is the mass of the electron, and \n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\u00af\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{{\\overline {\\nu }}_{e}}}\n\n is the mass of the electron antineutrino. In other words, the total energy released is the mass energy of the initial nucleus, minus the mass energy of the final nucleus, electron, and antineutrino. The mass of the nucleus mN is related to the standard atomic mass m by\nThat is, the total atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus, plus the mass of the electrons, minus the sum of all electron binding energies Bi for the atom. This equation is rearranged to find \n\n\n\n\nm\n\nN\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{N}\\left({\\ce {^{\\mathit {A}}_{\\mathit {Z}}X}}\\right)}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n\nm\n\nN\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\nA\n\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m_{N}\\left({\\ce {^{\\mathit {A}}_{{\\mathit {Z}}+1}X'}}\\right)}\n\n is found similarly. Substituting these nuclear masses into the Q-value equation, while neglecting the nearly-zero antineutrino mass and the difference in electron binding energies, which is very small for high-Z atoms, we have\nThis energy is carried away as kinetic energy by the electron and neutrino.\nBecause the reaction will proceed only when the Q-value is positive, \u03b2\u2212 decay can occur when the mass of atom A\nZX is greater than the mass of atom A\nZ+1X\u2019.[26]\nThe equations for \u00ce\u00b2+ decay are similar, with the generic equation\nHowever, in this equation, the electron masses do not cancel, and we are left with\nBecause the reaction will proceed only when the Q-value is positive, \u03b2+ decay can occur when the mass of atom A\nZX exceeds that of A\nZ-1X\u2019 by at least twice the mass of the electron.[26]\nThe analogous calculation for electron capture must take into account the binding energy of the electrons. This is because the atom will be left in an excited state after capturing the electron, and the binding energy of the captured innermost electron is significant. Using the generic equation for electron capture\nwhich simplifies to\nwhere Bn is the binding energy of the captured electron.\nBecause the binding energy of the electron is much less than the mass of the electron, nuclei that can undergo \u00ce\u00b2+ decay can always also undergo electron capture, but the reverse is not true.[26]\nBeta decay can be considered as a perturbation as described in quantum mechanics, and thus Fermi's Golden Rule can be applied. This leads to an expression for the kinetic energy spectrum N(T) of emitted betas as follows:[27]\nwhere T is the kinetic energy, CL is a shape function that depends on the forbiddenness of the decay (it is constant for allowed decays), F(Z, T) is the Fermi Function (see below) with Z the charge of the final-state nucleus, E=T + mc2 is the total energy, p=\u221a(E/c)2 \u2212 (mc)2 is the momentum, and Q is the Q value of the decay. The kinetic energy of the emitted neutrino is given approximately by Q minus the kinetic energy of the beta.\nAs an example, the beta decay spectrum of 210Bi (originally called RaE) is shown to the right.\nThe Fermi function that appears in the beta spectrum formula accounts for the Coulomb attraction / repulsion between the emitted beta and the final state nucleus. Approximating the associated wavefunctions to be spherically symmetric, the Fermi function can be analytically calculated to be:[28]\nwhere S=\u221a1 \u2212 \u03b12 Z2 (\u03b1 is the fine-structure constant), \u03b7=\u00b1 \u03b1ZE/pc (+ for electrons, \u2212 for positrons), \u03c1=rN/\u210f (rN is the radius of the final state nucleus), and \u0393 is the Gamma function.\nFor non-relativistic betas (Q \u00e2\u2030\u00aa mec2), this expression can be approximated by:[29]\nOther approximations can be found in the literature.[30][31]\nA Kurie plot (also known as a Fermi\u00e2\u20ac\u201cKurie plot) is a graph used in studying beta decay developed by Franz N. D. Kurie, in which the square root of the number of beta particles whose momenta (or energy) lie within a certain narrow range, divided by the Fermi function, is plotted against beta-particle energy.[32][33] It is a straight line for allowed transitions and some forbidden transitions, in accord with the Fermi beta-decay theory. The energy-axis (x-axis) intercept of a Kurie plot corresponds to the maximum energy imparted to the electron/positron (the decay's Q-value). With a Kurie plot one can find the limit on the effective mass of a neutrino.[34]\nAfter the discovery of parity non-conservation (see History), it was found that, in beta decay, electrons are emitted mostly with negative helicity, i.e., they move, naively speaking, like left-handed screws driven into a material (they have negative longitudinal polarization).[35] Conversely, positrons have mostly positive helicity, i.e., they move like right-handed screws. Neutrinos (emitted in positron decay) have positive helicity, while antineutrinos (emitted in electron decay) have negative helicity.[36]\nThe higher the energy of the particles, the higher their polarization.\nBeta decays can be classified according to the angular momentum (L-value) and total spin (S-value) of the emitted radiation. Since total angular momentum must be conserved, including orbital and spin angular momentum, beta decay occurs by a variety of quantum state transitions to various nuclear angular momentum or spin states, known as \"Fermi\" or \"Gamow-Teller\" transitions. When beta decay particles carry no angular momentum (L=0), the decay is referred to as \"allowed\", otherwise it is \"forbidden\".\nOther decay modes, which are rare, are known as bound state decay and double beta decay.\nA Fermi transition is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin \n\n\n\nS\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=0}\n\n, leading to an angular momentum change \n\n\n\n\u0394\nJ\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta J=0}\n\n between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition). In the non-relativistic limit, the nuclear part of the operator for a Fermi transition is given by\nwith \n\n\n\n\nG\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G_{V}}\n\n the weak vector coupling constant, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau _{\\pm }}\n\n the isospin raising and lowering operators, and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n running over all protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\nA Gamow-Teller transition is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin \n\n\n\nS\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=1}\n\n, leading to an angular momentum change \n\n\n\n\u0394\nJ\n=\n0\n,\n\u00b1\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta J=0,\\pm 1}\n\n between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition). In this case, the nuclear part of the operator is given by\nwith \n\n\n\n\nG\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G_{A}}\n\n the weak axial-vector coupling constant, and \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n\n the spin Pauli matrices, which can produce a spin-flip in the decaying nucleon.\nWhen L > 0, the decay is referred to as \"forbidden\". Nuclear selection rules require high L-values to be accompanied by changes in nuclear spin\u00a0(J) and parity\u00a0(\u03c0). The selection rules for the Lth forbidden transitions are:\nwhere \u0394\u03c0=1 or \u22121 corresponds to no parity change or parity change, respectively. The special case of a transition between isobaric analogue states, where the structure of the final state is very similar to the structure of the initial state, is referred to as \"superallowed\" for beta decay, and proceeds very quickly. The following table lists the \u0394J and \u0394\u03c0 values for the first few values of\u00a0L:\nA very small minority of free neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called \"two-body decays\", in which the proton, electron and antineutrino are produced, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV energy necessary to escape the proton, and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral hydrogen atom.[37] In this type of beta decay, in essence all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino.\nFor fully ionized atoms (bare nuclei), it is possible in likewise manner for electrons to fail to escape the atom, and to be emitted from the nucleus into low-lying atomic bound states (orbitals). This cannot occur for neutral atoms with low-lying bound states which are already filled by electrons.\nThe phenomenon in fully ionized atoms was first observed for 163Dy66+ in 1992 by Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group. Although neutral 163Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized 163Dy66+ undergoes \u03b2\u00a0decay into the K and L shells with a half-life of 47\u00a0days.[38]\nAnother possibility is that a fully ionized atom undergoes greatly accelerated \u03b2\u00a0decay, as observed for 187Re by Bosch et al., also at Darmstadt. Neutral 187Re does undergo \u03b2\u00a0decay with a half-life of 42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0years, but for fully ionized 187Re75+ this is shortened by a factor of 109 to only 32.9\u00a0years.[39] For comparison the variation of decay rates of other nuclear processes due to chemical environment is less than 1%.\nSome nuclei can undergo double beta decay (\u03b2\u03b2\u00a0decay) where the charge of the nucleus changes by two units. Double beta decay is difficult to study, as the process has an extremely long half-life. In nuclei for which both \u03b2\u00a0decay and \u03b2\u03b2\u00a0decay are possible, the rarer \u03b2\u03b2\u00a0decay process is effectively impossible to observe. However, in nuclei where \u03b2\u00a0decay is forbidden but \u03b2\u03b2\u00a0decay is allowed, the process can be seen and a half-life measured.[40] Thus, \u03b2\u03b2\u00a0decay is usually studied only for beta stable nuclei. Like single beta decay, double beta decay does not change A; thus, at least one of the nuclides with some given A has to be stable with regard to both single and double beta decay.\n\"Ordinary\" double beta decay results in the emission of two electrons and two antineutrinos. If neutrinos are Majorana particles (i.e., they are their own antiparticles), then a decay known as neutrinoless double beta decay will occur. Most neutrino physicists believe that neutrinoless double beta decay has never been observed.[40]",

        "text": "To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10\u00c2\u00a0years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.\nThe novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explains the novel's impact by writing, \"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\"[1]\nAs a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets.\nReaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book \"an astonishing phenomenon\".[2] In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \"every adult should read before they die\".[3] It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.\nTo Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only published book until Go Set a Watchman, an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.\nBorn in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer Truman Capote. She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944\u201345), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945\u201349). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time.[4] In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.\nDonations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.[5] After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled \"Go Set a Watchman\",[6] fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey, known professionally as Tay Hohoff. Hohoff was impressed, \u201c[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line,\u201d she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott,[6] but as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, \u201cmore a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.\u201d During the following two and a half years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form.[6]\nAfter the \"Watchman\" title was rejected, it was re-titled Atticus but Lee renamed it To Kill a Mockingbird to reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait. The book was published on July 11, 1960.[7] The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies.[8] In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, \"I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'\u00a0...\u00a0I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.\"[9] Instead of a \"quick and merciful death\", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.[10] Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.[11]\nThe story takes place during three years (1933\u00e2\u20ac\u201c35) of the Great Depression in the fictional \"tired old town\" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. It focuses on six-year-old Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed Scout), who lives with her older brother, Jeremy (nicknamed Jem), and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.\nJudge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a \"nigger-lover\". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus' and Tom's perspective.\nAtticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is available on the main floor, so by invitation of the Rev. Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers\u2014Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk\u2014are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus', when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.\nDespite Tom's conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, Atticus explaining that he \"destroyed [Ewell's] last shred of credibility at that trial.\"[12] Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus' face, trying to break into the judge's house, and menacing Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the confusion someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.\nSheriff Tate arrives and discovers that Bob Ewell has died during the fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the prudence and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets that they had never repaid him for the gifts he had given them.\nScout then goes back home to Atticus and stays up with him for a while in Jem's room. Soon Atticus takes her to bed and tucks her in, before leaving to go back to Jem.\nLee has said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author \"should write about what he knows and write truthfully\".[13] Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated,[14] he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years.[15] Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent.[16] Lee's older brother Edwin was the inspiration for Jem.\nLee modeled the character of Dill on her childhood friend, Truman Capote, known then as Truman Persons.[17][18] Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City.[19] Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote were atypical children: both loved to read. Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight, but Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter that Lee's father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them \"apart people\".[20] In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote's nonfiction novel In Cold Blood.[21]\nDown the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24\u00c2\u00a0years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten; he died in 1952.[22]\nThe origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10\u00c2\u00a0years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937.[23] Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys,[24][25] in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served \"the same purpose\" to display Southern prejudices.[26] Emmett Till, a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, is also considered a model for Tom Robinson.[27]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAllan Gurganus[28]\nThe strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which in an early review in Time was called \"tactile brilliance\".[29] Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, \"Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition.\"[30] Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives.[31] This narrative method allows Lee to tell a \"delightfully deceptive\" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition.[32] However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding.[33] Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.[34][35]\nWriting about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: \"Laughter\u00a0... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly\u00a0... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at.\"[36] Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her \"hysterically funny\".[37] To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times.[38] Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further.[39] Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking\u2014of education, the justice system, and her own society\u2014by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.[36]\nCritics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.[40] When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's.[41] Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.[42]\nScholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a Southern Gothic and a Bildungsroman. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson, contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel.[43][44] Lee used the term \"Gothic\" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.[45] Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.[46] Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism.[47] However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.[44]\nAs children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, \"It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon\u00c2\u00a0... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like\".[48] This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, \"To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be.\"[49]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201dClaudia Johnson in To Kill a Mockingbird: Threatening Boundaries, 1994[50]\nDespite the novel's immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is \"an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined\".[51] Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller (\"If that many people like it, it can't be any good.\") and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.[52]\nHarper Lee has remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused: \"Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.\"[53]\nWhen the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them.[54] The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism.[55] This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks),[56] and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of \"fine folks\" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.[55]\nThe second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\".[34] In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations.[57] Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \"reasonable to believe\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).[58] In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\"[59]\nScholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the \"mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood\".[27] Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways.[27] Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as \"stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him\".[60] Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.\nThe theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so.[61] Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog,[62] must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson\u00c2\u00a0.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\"[62]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLee Smith[63]\nIn a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was \"to be\u00c2\u00a0... the Jane Austen of South Alabama.\"[44] Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so.[64] Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia.[65] One writer notes that Scout, \"in Austenian fashion\", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.[66] Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: \"affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status\".[44]\nScholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex \"than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash'\u00c2\u00a0... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation.\"[59] Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community. The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.[59]\nThe novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage.[67][68] Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him. Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage.[69] In a statement that both foreshadows Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is \"when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what\".[70]\nCharles J. Shields, who wrote the first book-length biography of Harper Lee, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that \"its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal\".[71] Atticus' lesson to Scout that \"you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view\u2014until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it\" exemplifies his compassion.[68][72] She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. One writer remarks, \"...\u00a0[w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings.\"[68]\nJust as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider.[49] Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.[66] For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\"[66]\nAbsent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers.[73] Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter,[74] and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\"[73]\nAllusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that \"a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\".[75] The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him.[58] Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's \"fanatical\" attempts to place her in them made her feel \"a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]\".[76] Johnson states, \"[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.\"[58]\nSongbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee's mother's maiden name. The titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can \"shoot all the bluejays they want\", they must remember that \"it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\".[77] Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, \"They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.\"[77] Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, \"'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike Tom Robinson.\"[56] Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.[30][78][79]\nTom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: \"Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'\u2014that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.\"[80] The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson,[27] states about a character who was misunderstood, \"when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things\u00a0... Atticus, he was real nice,\" to which he responds, \"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\"[81]\nThe novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy.[30] In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and \"reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races\" while giving the \"appearance of gentility, piety, and morality\".[66] Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.[82]\nDespite her editors' warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama.[83] The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the Book of the Month Club and editions released by Reader's Digest Condensed Books.[84]\nInitial reactions to the novel were varied. The New Yorker declared Lee \"a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer\",[85] and The Atlantic Monthly's reviewer rated the book \"pleasant, undemanding reading\", but found the narrative voice\u2014\"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult\"\u2014to be implausible.[33] Time magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it \"teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life\" and calls Scout Finch \"the most appealing child since Carson McCullers' Frankie got left behind at the wedding\".[29] The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: \"This is in no way a sociological novel. It underlines no cause\u00a0... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance.\"[86]\nNot all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners, and one-dimensional black victims,[87] and Granville Hicks labeled the book \"melodramatic and contrived\".[35] When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, \"I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is.\"[51] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: \"Well, honey, one thing we know is that she's been poaching on my literary preserves.\"[88]\nOne year after its publication To Kill a Mockingbird had been translated into ten languages. In the years since, it has sold more than 30\u00a0million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages.[89] The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback, and has become part of the standard literature curriculum. A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9\u201312 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades.[90] A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress Center for the Book found that To Kill a Mockingbird was rated behind only the Bible in books that are \"most often cited as making a difference\".[91][note 1] It is considered by some to be the \"Great American Novel\".[92]\nThe 50th anniversary of the novel's release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact.[93] Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune praises Lee's \"rich use of language\" but writes that the central lesson is that \"courage isn't always flashy, isn't always enough, but is always in style\".[94] Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees, stating that the book \"still rouses fresh and horrified indignation\" as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable.[95] Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with \"a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question\", comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability.[96] Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland's The Herald notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen, stating the book's central theme, that \"one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moral convictions are worth fighting for, even at the risk of being reviled\" is eloquently discussed.[97]\nNative Alabamian sports writer Allen Barra sharply criticized Lee and the novel in The Wall Street Journal calling Atticus a \"repository of cracker-barrel epigrams\" and the novel represents a \"sugar-coated myth\" of Alabama history. Barra writes, \"It's time to stop pretending that To Kill a Mockingbird is some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of American literature. Its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated\".[98] Thomas Mallon in The New Yorker criticizes Atticus' stiff and self-righteous demeanor, and calls Scout \"a kind of highly constructed doll\" whose speech and actions are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel works, Mallon blasts Lee's \"wildly unstable\" narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama, following with his observation that \"the book has begun to cherish its own goodness\" by the time the case is over.[99][note 2] Defending the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice \"is often complicated, but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all.\" Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them.[100]\nMany writers compare their perceptions of To Kill a Mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout, Atticus, and Boo.[101]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201dScott Turow[102]\nOne of the most significant impacts To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, \"Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person.\"[103] Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence.[104] One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims, \"No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession,\" before questioning whether \"Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun\".[105]\nIn 1992, an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered. The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero.[106] Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb.[51] However, in 1997, the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the \"first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history\".[107] In 2008, Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who \"has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor\".[108]\nTo Kill a Mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000\u20132009.[109] Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016[110][111] and Biloxi in 2017,[112][113] where it was described as making people \"uncomfortable.\"[114] In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent.[115] Such decisions have been criticised: the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists.[116] Becky Little of The History Channel and representatives of the Mark Twain House pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to \"challenge the way we think about things\"[117] (Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has attracted similar controversy).[118] Arne Duncan, who served as Secretary of Education under President Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with \"real problems.\"[119] In 1966, a parent in Hanover, Virginia protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape.[120] Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 to The Richmond News Leader suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of \"the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice\".[53] The National Education Association in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations\u2014after Little Black Sambo.[121]\nWith a shift of attitudes about race in the 1970s, To Kill a Mockingbird faced challenges of a different sort: the treatment of racism in Maycomb was not condemned harshly enough. This has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers, but a more ambiguous reception by black readers. In one high-profile case outside the U.S., school districts in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the 1990s,[note 3] stating:\nThe terminology in this novel subjects students to humiliating experiences that rob them of their self-respect and the respect of their peers. The word 'Nigger' is used 48 times [in] the novel\u00a0... We believe that the English Language Arts curriculum in Nova Scotia must enable all students to feel comfortable with ideas, feelings and experiences presented without fear of humiliation\u00a0... To Kill a Mockingbird is clearly a book that no longer meets these goals and therefore must no longer be used for classroom instruction.[122]\nFurthermore, despite the novel's thematic focus on racial injustice, its black characters are not fully examined.[74] In its use of racial epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is an updated version of the \"contented slave\" motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters.[123][124] One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice \"functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us\u2014black and white, male and female\u2014to find our relative position in society\".[74] A teaching guide for the novel published by The English Journal cautions, \"what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another\".[125] A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it \"demoralizing\".[126] Another criticism, articulated by Michael Lind, is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural \"white trash\".[127]\nThe novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, however, in that it \"arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement\".[128] Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them.[129][130][131] Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it \"inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion\" and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as \"an act of humanity\" in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices.[132] Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel \"gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc\u00c2\u00a0... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view.\"[133]\nDiane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, \"for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual\u2014by its very existence an act of protest.\"[134][note 4] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: \"I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism\u00a0... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel\u00a0... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches.\" McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with \"honesty and integrity\".[135]\nDuring the years immediately following the novel's publication, Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book. In 1961, when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stunning Lee.[136] It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962.[84][137] Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that the questions were monotonous, and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought.[138] Since then, she declined talking with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: \"Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble.\"[139]\nIn 2001, Lee was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor.[140] In the same year, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city's libraries, and chose his favorite book, To Kill a Mockingbird, as the first title of the One City, One Book program. Lee declared that \"there is no greater honor the novel could receive\".[141] By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25\u00c2\u00a0communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel.[142] David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised The Big Read, states \"people just seem to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people's lives, and they cherish it.\"[143]\nIn 2006, Lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame. During the ceremony, the students and audience gave Lee a standing ovation, and the entire graduating class held up copies of To Kill a Mockingbird to honor her.[144][note 5] Lee was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 5, 2007 by President George W. Bush. In his remarks, Bush stated, \"One reason To Kill a Mockingbird succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author, which comes through on every page\u00c2\u00a0... To Kill a Mockingbird has influenced the character of our country for the better. It's been a gift to the entire world. As a model of good writing and humane sensibility, this book will be read and studied forever.\"[145]\nThe book was made into the well-received 1962 film with the same title, starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The film's producer, Alan J. Pakula, remembered Universal Pictures executives questioning him about a potential script: \"They said, 'What story do you plan to tell for the film?' I said, 'Have you read the book?' They said, 'Yes.' I said, 'That's the story.'\"[146] The movie was a hit at the box office, quickly grossing more than $20 million from a $2-million budget. It won three Oscars: Best Actor for Gregory Peck, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars including Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Mary Badham, the actress who played Scout.[147]\nHarper Lee was pleased with the movie, saying: \"In that film the man and the part met... I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art.\"[148] Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release. Lee was so impressed with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's pocket watch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor.[149] Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport. When Peck eventually did tell Lee, he said she responded, \"'Well, it's only a watch.' Harper\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe feels deeply, but she's not a sentimental person about things.\"[150] Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made. Peck's grandson was named \"Harper\" in her honor.[151]\nIn May 2005, Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the Los Angeles Public Library at the request of Peck's widow Veronique, who said of Lee: \"She's like a national treasure. She's someone who has made a difference...with this book. The book is still as strong as it ever was, and so is the film. All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays. My husband used to get thousands and thousands of letters from teachers who would send them to him.\"[9]\nThe book has also been adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel. It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself \"The Literary Capital of Alabama\". The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated.[152] Author Albert Murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): \"It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of Mardi Gras. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat Monroeville aspires to be.\"[153]\nSergel's play toured in the UK starting at West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in 2006,[154] and again in 2011 starting at the York Theatre Royal,[155] both productions featuring Duncan Preston as Atticus Finch. The play also opened the 2013 season at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre in London where it played to full houses and starred Robert Sean Leonard as Atticus Finch, his first London appearance in 22 years. The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.[156]\nAccording to a National Geographic article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because \"she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame\".[157] To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes named Calpurnia's Cookbook not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum.[158] David Lister in The Independent states that Lee's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more, and her silence \"makes Bob Dylan look like a media tart\".[159] Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the book, or Lee herself. Local residents call them \"Mockingbird groupies\", and although Lee was not reclusive, she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic \"Hell, no!\"[160]\nAn earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015.[161][162][163] This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative.[6][161] This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York City to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it, but this claim has been widely disputed.[161][162][163] Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird.[164] According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\"[165] This assertion has been discredited, however,[166] by rare-books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of To Kill a Mockingbird.[166] Nurnberg's statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how Watchman was seen as just the first draft of Mockingbird.[6] Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.[167]",

        "text": "Amazon.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon (/\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259\u02ccz\u0252n/), is an American electronic commerce and cloud computing company based in Seattle, Washington that was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994. The tech giant is the largest Internet retailer in the world as measured by revenue and market capitalization, and second largest after Alibaba Group in terms of total sales.[5] The amazon.com website started as an online bookstore and later diversified to sell video downloads/streaming, MP3 downloads/streaming, audiobook downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. The company also produces consumer electronics\u2014Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, and Echo\u2014and is the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services (IaaS and PaaS).[6] Amazon also sells certain low-end products under its in-house brand AmazonBasics.\nAmazon has separate retail websites for the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, India, and Mexico. In 2016, Dutch, Polish, and Turkish language versions of the German Amazon website were also launched.[7][8][9] Amazon also offers international shipping to certain other countries for some of its products.[10]\nIn 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[11] Amazon is the fourth most valuable public company in the world, the largest Internet company by revenue in the world, and the eighth largest employer in the United States.[12] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, which vastly increased Amazon's presence as a brick-and-mortar retailer.[13] The acquisition was interpreted by some as a direct attempt to challenge Walmart's traditional retail stores.[14]\nThe company was founded as a result of what Jeff Bezos called his \"regret minimization framework,\" which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the Internet business boom during that time.[15] In 1994, Bezos left his employment as vice-president of D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle, Washington. He began to work on a business plan[16] for what would eventually become Amazon.com.\nOn July 5, 1994, Bezos initially incorporated the company with the name Cadabra, Inc.[17] Bezos changed the name to Amazon.com, Inc. a few months later, after a lawyer misheard its original name as \"cadaver\".[18] In September 1994, Bezos purchased the URL Relentless.com and briefly considered naming his online store Relentless, but friends told him the name sounded a bit sinister. The domain is still owned by Bezos and still redirects to the retailer.[19][20] The company went online as Amazon.com in 1995.[21]\nBezos selected the name Amazon by looking through the dictionary; he settled on \"Amazon\" because it was a place that was \"exotic and different\", just as he had envisioned for his Internet enterprise. The Amazon River, he noted, was the biggest river in the world, and he planned to make his store the biggest bookstore in the world.[21] Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand and told a reporter, \"There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.\"[22] Additionally, a name that began with \"A\" was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetized.[citation needed]\nAfter reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual Web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, due to the large worldwide demand for literature, the low price points for books, along with the huge number of titles available in print.[23] Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' home in Bellevue, Washington.[24]\nThe company began as an online bookstore, which was an idea spurred off with a discussion with John Ingram of Ingram Book (now called Ingram Content Group), along with Keyur Patel who still holds a stake in Amazon.[25] Amazon was able to access books at wholesale from Ingram. In the first two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries. Within two months, Amazon's sales were up to $20,000/week.[26] While the largest brick and mortar bookstores and mail order catalogs might offer 200,000 titles, an online bookstore could \"carry\" several times more, since it would have a practically unlimited virtual warehouse: those of the actual product makers/suppliers.[citation needed]\nAmazon was incorporated in 1994 in Washington State. In July 1995, the company began service and sold its first book on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.[27] In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public.[28] In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of stock on May 15, 1997, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN, at a price of US$18.00 per share ($1.50 after three stock splits in the late 1990s).[citation needed]\nBarnes & Noble sued Amazon on May 12, 1997, alleging that Amazon's claim to be \"the world's largest bookstore\" was false because it \"...isn't a bookstore at all. It's a book broker.\" The suit was later settled out of court and Amazon continued to make the same claim.[29] Walmart sued Amazon on October 16, 1998, alleging that Amazon had stolen Walmart's trade secrets by hiring former Walmart executives. Although this suit was also settled out of court, it caused Amazon to implement internal restrictions and the reassignment of the former Walmart executives.[29]\nSince June 19, 2000, Amazon's logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.[30]\nAmazon's initial business plan was unusual; it did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This \"slow\" growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long-term. The dot-com bubble burst at the start of the 21st century and destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $5 million (i.e., 1\u00c2\u00a2 per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed.[31] In 1999, Time magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the company's success in popularizing online shopping.[citation needed]\nIn 2011, Amazon had 30,000 full-time employees in the USA, and by the end of 2016, it had 180,000 employees. The company employs 306,800 people worldwide in full and part-time jobs.[32]\nOn October 11, 2016, Amazon announced plans to build convenience stores and develop curbside pickup locations for food.[33] In December 2016, the Amazon Go store was opened to Amazon employees in Seattle.[34] The store uses a variety of sensors and automatically charges a shopper's Amazon account as they walk out of the store, eliminating the need for checkout lines.[35][36] The store is planned to open for the general public in early 2017.[37][38][needs update]\nIn June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire Whole Foods, a high-end supermarket chain with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.[13][39] The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge Walmart's supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer. This sentiment was heightened by the fact that the announcement coincided with Walmart's purchase of men's apparel company Bonobos.[40] On August 23, 2017, Whole Foods shareholders, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, approved the deal.[41][42]\nIn September 2017, Amazon announced plans to locate a second headquarters in a metropolitan area with at least a million people.[43] Cities needed to submit their presentations by October 19, 2017 for the project called HQ2.[44] The $5 billion second headquarters, starting with 500,000 square feet and eventually expanding to as much as 8 million square feet, may have as many as 50,000 employees.[45]\nIn 2020, Amazon will build a new downtown Seattle building with space for Mary's Place, a local charity.[46]\nAmazon owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Zappos, Shopbop, Diapers.com, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Audible, Goodreads, Teachstreet and IMDb.[61]\nAs of February 2016[update], the board of directors is:[62]\nUntil June 30, 2006, typing ToysRUs.com into a browser would bring up Amazon.com's \"Toys & Games\" tab; however, this relationship was terminated due to a lawsuit.[63] Amazon also hosted and managed the website for Borders bookstores but this ceased in 2008.[64] From 2001 until August 2011, Amazon hosted the retail website for Target.[65]\nAmazon.com operates retail websites for Sears Canada, Bebe Stores, Marks & Spencer, Mothercare, and Lacoste. For a growing number of enterprise clients, including the UK merchants Marks & Spencer, Benefit Cosmetics' UK entity, edeals.com and Mothercare, Amazon provides a unified multichannel platform where a customer can interact with the retail website, standalone in-store terminals or phone-based customer service agents. Amazon Web Services also powers AOL's Shop@AOL.[citation needed]\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[66]\nIn November 2013, Amazon.com announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York due to the high-volume and inability to deliver timely, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[67]\nIn July 2016, Amazon.com announced a partnership with the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority to test some of the technologies and may use delivery service via prime air drone in the future.[68]\nIn June 2017, Nike confirmed a partnership with Amazon, stating it to be in an initial phase where they'll be selling goods on Amazon.[69][70][71]\nAs of October 11, 2017, AmazonFresh sell a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[72]\nAmazon.com's product lines available at its website include several media (books, DVDs, music CDs, videotapes and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal-care items, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items and toys & games.[citation needed]\nAmazon is now gearing up in India to play a role in the grocery retail sector aimed at delivering customer needs.[73]\nAmazon.com has a number of products and services available, including:\nAmazon Maritime, Inc. holds a Federal Maritime Commission license to operate as a non-vessel-owning common carrier (NVOCC), which enables the company to manage its own shipments from China into the United States.[74]\nAudible.com is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and TV programs and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. On January 31, 2008, Amazon announced it would buy Audible for about $300 million. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[75]\nBeijing Century Joyo Courier Services is a subsidiary of Amazon and it applied for a freight forwarding license with the US Maritime Commission. Amazon is also building out its logistics in trucking and air freight to potentially compete with UPS and FedEx.[76][77]\nBrilliance Audio is an audiobook publisher founded in 1984 by Michael Snodgrass in Grand Haven, Michigan.[78] The company produced its first 8 audio titles in 1985.[78] The company was purchased by Amazon in 2007 for an undisclosed amount.[79][80] At the time of the acquisition, Brilliance was producing 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 new titles a month.[80] It operates as an independent company within Amazon.\nIn 1984, Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette.[81] The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track.[81] It has been credited with revolutionizing the burgeoning audiobook market in the mid-1980s since it made unabridged books affordable.[81]\nComiXology is a cloud-based digital comics platform with over 200 million comic downloads as of September 2013. It offers a selection of more than 40,000 comic books and graphic novels across Android, iOS, Fire OS and Windows 8 devices and over a web browser. Amazon bought the company in April 2014.[82]\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Chandler. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their own groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members and over 10 million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[83]\nShelfari was a social cataloging website for books. Shelfari users built virtual bookshelves of the titles which they owned or had read and they could rate, review, tag and discuss their books. Users could also create groups that other members could join, create discussions and talk about books, or other topics. Recommendations could be sent to friends on the site for what books to read. Amazon bought the company in August 2008.[83] Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.[84][85]\nTwitch is a live streaming platform for video, primarily oriented towards video gaming content. The service was first established as a spin-off of a general-interest streaming service known as Justin.tv. Its prominence was eclipsed by that of Twitch, and Justin.tv was eventually shut down by its parent company in August 2014 in order to focus exclusively on Twitch.[86] Later that month, Twitch was acquired by Amazon for $970 million.[87] Through Twitch, Amazon also owns Curse, Inc., an operator of video gaming communities and a provider of VoIP services for gaming.[88] Since the acquisition, Twitch began to sell games directly through the platform,[89] and began offering special features for Amazon Prime subscribers.[90]\nThe site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[91] As of 2015, the service had over 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million monthly viewers.[92]\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[93]\nOn August 23, 2017, it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission approved the merger between Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market.[94] The following day it was announced that the deal would be closed on August 28, 2017.[95]\nThe domain amazon.com attracted at least 615 million visitors annually by 2008.[98] Amazon attracts over 130 million customers to its US website per month by the start of 2016.[99] The company has also invested heavily on a massive amount of server capacity for its website, especially to handle the excessive traffic during the December Christmas holiday season.[100]\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[101]\nAmazon's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicate the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicate that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. Customers may comment or vote on the reviews, indicating whether they found a review helpful to them. If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[102]\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach\u00a0... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly\u00a0... to let truth loose\".[103]\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[104] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\"Search Inside the Book\" is a feature which allows customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog.[105][106] The feature started with 120,000 titles (or 33 million pages of text) on October 23, 2003.[107] There are about 300,000 books in the program. Amazon has cooperated with around 130 publishers to allow users to perform these searches.[citation needed]\nTo avoid copyright violations, Amazon does not return the computer-readable text of the book. Instead, it returns a picture of the matching page, instructs the web browser to disable printing and puts limits on the number of pages in a book a single user can access. Additionally, customers can purchase online access to some of the same books via the \"Amazon Upgrade\" program.[citation needed]\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[108] Associates receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[109] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[110] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[111] Amazon reported over 1.3 million sellers sold products through Amazon's websites in 2007. Unlike eBay, Amazon sellers do not have to maintain separate payment accounts; all payments are handled by Amazon.[citation needed]\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched (rumored to be internally called \"Project Genesis\") to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[112]\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) provides an indication of the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[113] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its best-sellers lists.[113] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[114] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[115] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[116] though Amazon states:\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\nAmazon runs data centers for its online services and owns generators or purchases electricity corresponding to its consumption, mostly renewable energy.[118] The US Navy has stated that its Relocatable Radar remains operable regardless of a new Amazon wind farm in North Carolina.[119][example's importance?] The company also records data on customer buyer behavior which enables them to offer or recommend to an individual specific item or bundles of items based upon preferences demonstrated through purchases or items visited.[120]\nOn January 31, 2013, Amazon experienced an outage that lasted approximately 49 minutes, leaving its site inaccessible to some customers.[121]\nOn May 5, 2014, Amazon unveiled a partnership with Twitter. Twitter users can link their accounts to an Amazon account and automatically add items to their shopping carts by responding to any tweet with an Amazon product link bearing the hashtag #AmazonCart. This allows customers to never leave their Twitter feed and the product is waiting for them when they go to the Amazon website.[122]\nAmazon employs a multi-level e-commerce strategy. Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post-Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.[123]\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[124] Amazon also employs the use of drop shippers or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.[citation needed]\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore location. It is named Amazon Books and is located in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[125] Amazon will open its tenth physical book store in 2017;[126] media speculation suggests Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[125] Amazon plans to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany. [127]\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.[128]\nSince its founding, the company has attracted criticism and controversy from multiple sources over its actions. These include: luring customers away from the site's brick and mortar competitors,[129] poor warehouse conditions for workers; anti-unionization efforts; Amazon Kindle remote content removal; taking public subsidies; its \"1-Click patent\" claims; anti-competitive actions;[130] price discrimination; various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website; LGBT book sales rank;[131][132] and works containing libel, facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[133] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[134][135] The company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[101] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[136][137]\nOn October 16, 2016, Apple filed a trademark infringement case against Mobile Star LLC for selling counterfeit Apple products to Amazon. In the suit, Apple provided evidence that Amazon was selling these counterfeit Apple products and advertising them as genuine. Through purchasing, Apple was able to identify that nearly 90% of the Apple accessories sold and fulfilled by Amazon were counterfeit. Amazon was sourcing and selling items without properly determining if they are genuine. Mobile Star LLC settled with Apple for an undisclosed amount on April 27, 2017.[138]\nAmazon state sales tax collection policy has changed over the years since in the company's beginning it did not collect any sale taxes. In the U.S., state and local sales taxes are levied by state and local governments, not at the federal level. In most countries where Amazon operates, a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country, and Amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers. Proponents of forcing Amazon.com to collect sales tax\u2014at least in states where it maintains a physical presence\u2014argue the corporation wields an anti-competitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax.[139]\nMany U.S. states in the 21st century have passed online shopping sales tax laws designed to compel Amazon.com and other e-commerce retailers to collect state and local sales taxes from its customers. Amazon.com originally collected sales tax only from five states as of 2011, but as of April 2017, Amazon collects sales taxes from customers in all 45 states that have a state sales tax and in Washington, D.C.[140]\nAmazon has attracted widespread criticism for poor working conditions by both current employees, which refer to themselves as Amazonians,[141] and former employees,[142][143] as well as the media and politicians. In 2011 it was publicized that at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse, workers had to carry out work in 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) heat, resulting in employees becoming extremely uncomfortable and suffering from dehydration and collapse. Loading-bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air as \"managers were worried about theft\". Amazon's initial response was to pay for an ambulance to sit outside on call to cart away overheated employees.[citation needed]\nSome workers, \"pickers\", who travel the building with a trolley and a handheld scanner \"picking\" customer orders can walk up to 15 miles during their workday and if they fall behind on their targets, they can be reprimanded. The handheld scanners give real-time information to the employee on how fast or slowly they are working; the scanners also serve to allow Team Leads and Area Managers to track the specific locations of employees and how much \"idle time\" they gain when not working.[144][145] In a German television report broadcast in February 2013, journalists Diana L\u00c3\u00b6bl and Peter Onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of Amazon in the town of Bad Hersfeld in the German state of Hessen. The report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards, themselves being employed by a third party company, who apparently either had a Neo-nazi background or deliberately dressed in Neo-Nazi apparel and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centers. The third party security company involved was delisted by Amazon as a business contact shortly after that report.[146][147][148][149][150]\nIn March 2015, it was reported in The Verge that Amazon will be removing 18 months long non-compete clauses from its US employment contracts for hourly-paid workers, after criticism that it was acting unreasonably in preventing such employees from finding other work. Even short-term temporary workers have to sign contracts that prohibit them from working at any company where they would \"directly or indirectly\" support any good or service that competes with those they helped support at Amazon, for 18 months after leaving Amazon, even if they are fired or made redundant.[151][152]\nA substantial New York Times article published on August 16, 2015, described evidence of an intimidating and confrontational working culture for the company's office workers.[11]\nIn an effort to boost employee morale, on November 2, 2015, Amazon announced that it would be extending 6 weeks of paid leave for new mothers and fathers. This change includes birth parents and adoptive parents and can be applied in conjunction with existing maternity leave and medical leave for new mothers.[153]\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[154]\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[155]\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[156] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[157]\nA number of companies have been started and founded by former Amazon employees.[158]",

        "text": "The Ford F-Series is a series of light-duty trucks and medium-duty trucks (Class 2-7) that have been marketed and manufactured by Ford Motor Company since 1948. While most variants of the F-Series trucks are full-size pickup trucks, the F-Series also includes chassis cab trucks and commercial vehicles. The Ford F-Series has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States since 1986 and the best-selling pickup since 1977.[1][2] It is also the best selling vehicle in Canada.[3] As of the 2018 model year, the F-Series generates $41.0 billion in annual revenue for Ford, making the F-Series brand more valuable than Coca-Cola and Nike.[4]\nIn 1999, to bridge the gap between the pickup line and the medium-duty trucks, the F-250 and F-350 became the Ford Super Duty vehicles; considered an expansion of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks are built on a distinct chassis with heavier-duty components. As of the 2017 model year, the F-Series includes the F-150, the Super Duty (F-250 through F-550), and F-650 and F-750 Super Duty medium-duty commercial trucks. The most popular version of the F-Series is the F-150, now in its thirteenth generation.\nThrough the use of rebadging, Ford has marketed the F-Series through all three Ford divisions in North America. From 1946 to 1968, Mercury sold the Mercury M-Series in Canada; during the 2000s, Lincoln sold the Lincoln Blackwood, replaced by the Lincoln Mark LT.\nThe first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in 1948 as a replacement for the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, cab-over engine (COE), conventional truck, and school bus chassis body styles.\nFor the 1953 model year, an all-new version of the F-Series made its debut. Increased dimensions, improved engines, and an updated chassis were features of the second generation.\nAdditionally, a change to the F-Series naming scheme would remain in place to the present day. The half-ton F-1 became the F-100 (partially influenced by the North American F-100 Super Sabre); the F-2 and F-3 were combined into the F-250 while the F-4 became the F-350. Conventional F-Series trucks were F-500 to F-900; COE chassis were C-Series trucks.\nIntroduced in 1957, the third generation F-series was a significant modernization and redesign. Front fenders became integrated into the body, and the new Styleside bed continued the smooth lines to the rear of the pickup.\nThe cab-over F-Series was discontinued, having been replaced by the tilt-cab C-Series.\nIn 1959, Ford began in-house production of four-wheel-drive pickups.\nFord introduced a dramatically new style of pickup in 1961 with the fourth generation F-Series. Longer and lower than its predecessors, these trucks had increased dimensions and new engine and gearbox choices. Additionally, the 1961\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1963 models were constructed as a unibody design with the cab and bed integrated. This proved unpopular and Ford reverted to the traditional separate cab/bed design in 1964.\nIn 1965, the F-Series was given a significant mid-cycle redesign. A completely new platform, including the \"Twin I-Beam\" front suspension, was introduced that would be used until 1996 on the F-150 and until 2016 on the F-250/350 4x2. Additionally that year, the Ranger name made its first appearance on a Ford pickup; previously a base model of the Edsel, it was now used to denote a high-level styling package for F-Series pickups.[5]\nIntroduced in 1967, the fifth generation F-series pickup was built on the same platform as the 1965 revision of the fourth generation. Dimensions and greenhouse glass were increased, engine options expanded, and plusher trim levels became available during the fifth generation's production run.\nSuspension components from all 1969 F-Series models are completely interchangeable.\nA variant of the fifth generation F-series was produced until 1992 in Brazil for the South American market.\nThe sixth generation F-series was introduced in 1973. This version of the F-series continued to be built on the 1965 fourth generation's revised platform, but with significant modernizations and refinements. Front disc brakes, increased cabin dimensions, gas tank relocated outside the cab and under the bed, significantly improved heating and air conditioning, full double wall bed construction, increased use of galvanized steel, SuperCab was introduced in the sixth generation pickup.\nThe FE engine series was discontinued in 1976 after a nearly 20-year run, replaced by the more modern 351 series (Modified) and 400 series engines.\nIn 1975, the F-150 was introduced in between the F-100 and the F-250 in order to avoid certain emission control restrictions. For 1978, square headlights replaced the previous models' round ones on higher trim package models, such as Lariat and Ranger, and in 1979 became standard equipment. Also for 1978, the Ford Bronco was redesigned into a variant of the F-series pickup. 1979 was the last year that the 460 big block engine was available in a half ton truck.\nThe 1980 F-Series was redesigned with an all-new chassis and larger body; this was the first ground-up redesign since 1965. The exterior styling of the truck was redone to improve aerodynamics and fuel economy. Medium-duty F-Series (F600-F900) were also redesigned; although they shared the cabin of the smaller pickup trucks, the largest version of F-Series now wore a bonnet with separate front wings (like the L-Series). Medium duty Ford F-Series would carry the 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 interior design until 2000 (though pickups were restyled again in 1987 and 1992), with very subtle changes such as window glass and electronics.\nIn a move towards fuel efficiency, Ford dropped the M-Series engines (the 5.8 Liter 351M and 6.6 Liter 400\u00a0cu\u00a0in V8s) in 1981, replacing them with the 4.2 Liter 255 C.I. and 5.8 Liter 351 C.I. Windsor V8 engines from the Panther platform. The 255 V8 was simply a 5.0L, 302 V8 with a smaller bore, built specifically for better fuel economy, but was dropped for the 1982 model year due to being underpowered and having limited demand. For 1982 and 1983, the 3.8L, 232 C.I. Essex V6 was the base engine but was quickly dropped for the 1984 model year. In 1983, Ford added Diesel power to the F-Series through a partnership with International Harvester (later Navistar). The 6.9L, 420 C.I. IDI V8 produced similar power output as the gasoline 351 Windsor V8, with the fuel economy of the 4.9L, 300 I6. From this point on (1983-present), the heavier duty f-series trucks (F-350 and above) were usually equipped with the Diesel engines as standard horsepower. 1985 was the first year of electronic fuel injection on the 5.0L V8, all other engines following suit in 1988. There was a new \"high output\" version of the 5.8L Windsor beginning in 1984.\nA noticeable change was made to the F-Series in 1982 as the Ford \"Blue Oval\" was added to the center of the grill, also the Ranger and Custom trims were no longer available. The Ranger name had been shifted onto the all-new compact pickup developed as a replacement for the Courier. The new trim levels were a no-badge base model (essentially the new Custom), XL, a very rare XLS, and XLT Lariat.\n1983 marked the final year of the F-100, making the F-150 the lightest pickup available on the market. F-100s and F-150s were virtually identical with the exception of smaller brakes and a 5x4.5 bolt pattern on the F-100 axles, as opposed to 5x5.5 on the F-150. F-100s over a certain GVWR and/or without power brakes did use the F-150 axles. Also, the 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1983 F-100 was never offered with four-wheel-drive.\n1986 marked the final year that the F-150 was available with a 3-speed manual gearbox that shifted via a steering column lever (3-on-the-tree). Incidentally, this was the second-last vehicle in the United States that offered this set up. 1986 was also the last year the Explorer package was available.\nThis is the first generation of trucks to incorporate amenities such as power mirrors, power windows, and power door locks.\nThe 1987 F-Series carried over the same body style from the seventh generation, yet sported a new rounded front clip that improved aerodynamics, as well as the softening of body lines around the rear of the bed and fender arches around the wheel wells. The interior was also completely redesigned in 1987. The transmissions available on SuperCab models were a four-or five-speed manual; regular cab models were also available with automatic transmission. The Custom trim made a comeback for the eighth generation. In 1988, the 4.9 Liter inline-six, 5.8 Liter V8, and 7.5 Liter V8 engines gained electronic fuel injection. International Navistar also increased the displacement of their 6.9 Liter V8 in the same year, resulting in the new 7.3 Liter unit. This was also the first year of a five-speed manual overdrive transmission, which included the Mazda M5OD in the F-150s and the heavy-duty ZF5 in the F-250s and F-350s. Four-speed manuals were dropped as standard equipment after 1987, but were available as a customer-ordered option until 1989. In 1989, the C6 three-speed automatic was replaced as the base automatic transmission with the E4OD, a four-speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive unit, though the C6 was still available as an option, mostly in F-250s and F-350s, until 1997. Heavy-Duty models included F-250s and F-350s (along with F-Super Dutys) that were classified as incomplete vehicles only that were produced with no bed, but appeared as tow trucks, box trucks (notably U-Haul), flatbed trucks, dump trucks and other models. Although the F-250s, F-250 HDs (heavy duty), and F-350s were built as a Chassis cab models only from 1987 to 1997, owners can convert the models to pickup trucks. However General Pacheco, Argentina and S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil assemblies were the only places F-250, F-250 HD, and F-350 were built and sold as pickup trucks models. Despite being produced only in General Pacheco, Argentina and S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil assemblies (located in South America) F-250s, F-250 HDs, and F-350s were shipped from South America to the United States as imports from 1987 to 1997.\nFor the 1992 model year, the body-shell of the 1980 F-Series was given another major upgrade. To further improve its aerodynamics, the forward bodywork was given a slightly lower hoodline, rounding the front fenders and grille; in addition, the changes matched the F-Series with the design of the newly introduced Explorer and redesigned E-Series and Ranger. Along with the exterior updates, the interior received a complete redesign.\nDormant since 1987, the FlareSide bed made its return as an option for 1992. To increase its appeal for younger buyers, the bed bodywork was redesigned, borrowing the sides of the F-350 dual-rear wheel bed (fitted to the narrower F-150 single-wheel chassis). To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first Ford factory-produced truck (the 1917 Ford Model TT), Ford offered a 75th anniversary package on its 1992 F-series, consisting of a stripe package, an argent colored step bumper, and special 75th anniversary logos. In 1993, the 240\u00c2\u00a0hp SVT Lightning was introduced as a specially-tuned performance truck; over 11,000 were built from 1993 to 1995.\nIn a trim shift, the XLT Lariat was dropped and combined with the XLT; the XL took over for the Custom trim after 1993 (marking the last usage of the Custom nameplate by Ford). In 1995, the Eddie Bauer trim made its return.\nIn 1995, the medium-duty Ford F-Series (F-600 through F-800 and all Ford B-Series) were given their first update since 1980. All versions (except severe-service) received a hood redesign which enlarged the grille and moved the turn signal indicators to the outside of the front headlights.\nDuring the second half of 1997, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350. The body style stayed the same until the end of 1997. The only change of the F-250 HD and F-350 was that they no longer has classic style tailgates, with the stainless steel cap on them which read FORD. Instead the tailgate had the F-250 Heavy Duty/F-350 nameplate labeled on its left side, while Ford's blue oval was labeled on The right side (similarly styled like the 1997 Ford F-150 around this same time). The F-250 HD also had some minor changes in trim location, and options available. The 1997 F-250 HD with the 7.3 Powerstroke Diesel is also the rarest and most desirable of ninth generation Fords.\nFollowing the introduction of the tenth-generation F-150, the F-250 and F-350 continued into production into the 1998 model year, becoming part of the Ford F-Series Super Duty line as they were replaced in 1999.\nFor 1997, Ford Motor Company made a major change to its F-Series family of trucks as the F-Series pickup line was essentially split in two. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, buyers of pickup trucks had increasingly purchased the vehicles for the purposes of personal use over work use. To further increase its growing market share, Ford sought to develop vehicles for both types of buyers. In its ultimate decision, the company decided to make the F-150 as a contemporary vehicle for personal use, while the F-250 and F-350 would be designed more conservatively for work-based customers.\nIntroduced in early 1996 as a 1997 model, the F-150 was a completely new vehicle in comparison from its predecessor. Similar to the original Ford Taurus of 1986, the 1997 F-150 was developed with a radically streamlined body. Dispensing with the traditional Twin I-Beam for a fully independent front suspension, the all-new chassis shared only the transmissions with the previous generation. In a major change, the long-running 4.9L inline-6 was replaced by a V6 engine as standard. The 4.6L Modular V8 shared with the Panther cars was optional (with a 5.4L version added in mid-1997); originally developed for use in the F-Series, the Modular/Triton V8 was the first overhead-cam engine ever fitted to a full-size pickup truck.\nTo improve rear-seat access for SuperCab models, a rear-hinged (curb-side) door was added to all versions. Following its popularity, the SuperCab gained a fourth door for 1999. In 2001, the F-150 became the first pickup truck in its size segment to become available with four full-size doors. Sharing the length of a standard-bed SuperCab, the F-150 SuperCrew was produced with a slightly shortened bed.\nDuring the second half of the 1997 model year, Ford introduced a heavier GVWR version (8800 GVW), bearing the F-250 name. It was distinguished by seven-lug nut wheels. At the same time, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350 (same body style as the 1992 to 1997 model years; it was still built in South America only). Following the introduction of the Super Duty for 1999, it was quietly dropped.\nIn 1999, the SVT Lightning made its return, with output expanded to 360\u00c2\u00a0hp; over 28,000 were produced from 1999 to 2003. For 2002, Lincoln-Mercury gained its first full-size pickup truck since 1968 with the introduction of the Lincoln Blackwood, the first Lincoln pickup. Sharing the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator SUV, the Blackwood was designed with a model-exclusive bed and was sold only in black. Due to very poor sales, the Blackwood was discontinued after 2002.\nIn 1998, the F-250 and F-350 pickups were introduced as the 1999 Ford F-Series Super Duty model line. While remaining part of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks use a different platform architecture, powertrain, and design language, primarily as they are intended for heavy-duty work use. Designed in a joint venture with Navistar International, the medium-duty F-650/F-750 Super Duty were introduced in 2000.\nFor the 2004 model year, the F-150 was redesigned on an all-new platform. Externally, the eleventh-generation model was different from its predecessor, with sharper-edged styling; a major change was the adoption of the stepped driver's window from the Super Duty trucks. Regardless of cab type, all F-150s were given four doors, with the rear doors on the regular cab providing access to behind-the-seat storage. Ford also introduced the Triton engines in the variants of the F-150. Due to declining sales, the Flareside beds were dropped; this marked the first time in 56 years of F-Series production that Flareside beds were not available.\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Lincoln-Mercury dealers sold this version of the F-150 as the Lincoln Mark LT, replacing the Blackwood.\nIn late 2006, the Super Duty trucks were also given an all-new platform. While using the same bed and cabin as before, these are distinguished from their predecessors by an all-new interior and a much larger grille and head lamps. Previously available only as a chassis-cab model, the F-450 now was available as a pickup directly from Ford.[6]\nFrom 2004 to 2006 offered a different bed style as well.\nThe twelfth generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year as an update of the Ford full-size truck platform. Similar to its predecessor, these trucks are distinguished by their Super Duty-style grilles and head lamps; standard cab models again have two-doors instead of four. The FlareSide bed was continued until 2010, dropped along with the manual gearbox; outside of Mexico, the Lincoln Mark LT was replaced by the F-150 Platinum. A new model for 2010 included the SVT Raptor, a dedicated off-road pickup.\nAs part of a major focus on fuel economy, the entire engine lineup for the F-150 was updated for the 2011 model year. Along with two new V8 engines, the F-150 gained a new 3.7 Liter base V6 engine, and a powerful twin-turbocharged 3.5 Liter V6, dubbed EcoBoost by Ford. An automatic transmission is the only option. Other modifications include the addition of a Nexteer Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) system on most models.\nA recent study conducted by iSeeCars.com and published on the Ford Motor Company Web site listed Ford F-250 Super Duty as the top longest-lasting vehicle and Expedition, Explorer and F-150 in the top 20 longest-lasting vehicle.[7]\nFor the 2015 model year, Ford Motor Company introduced the thirteenth-generation F-150. Without physically changing any dimensions from its predecessor, in the interest of fuel economy, designers reduced curb weight by nearly 750 pounds. In a radical change for a mass-market vehicle, much of the weight reduction stems from the change from steel to aluminum in its body structure (the majority of the frame itself remains high-strength steel).[8][9] With the lone exception of the firewall, all sheet metal used for the F-150 body is aluminum.[9][10]\nLargely previewed by the Ford Atlas concept vehicle at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the styling introduced a completely new design language for the Ford F-Series; only the stepped window from the Super Duty was carried over. To prove the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, camouflaged prototypes were entered in the Baja 1000 endurance race, in which the vehicles finished.\nTo further increase fuel economy, a 3.5L V6 became the base engine with the introduction of a 2.7L EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 alongside the 3.5L version; the 5.0L V8 remained available. The 2015 F-150 is the first pickup truck with adaptive cruise control, which uses radar sensors on the front of the vehicle to maintain a set following distance between it and the vehicle ahead of it, decreasing speed if necessary.\nFord has made several changes to their engine lineup for the 2018 model-year pickup, which Ford has confirmed will be a member of the thirteenth generation.[11][12][13] The 3.5L base engine has been replaced with a more efficient 3.3L V6 that boasts the same power as the outgoing 3.5, but promises better mileage.[14] The new 3.3L V6 will be mated to the existing 6-speed transmission. The 2.7L and 3.5L EcoBoost engines, as well as the 5.0L V8 have had minor upgrades and improvements towards power and efficiency. The 3.5L, 2.7l EcoBoost and 5.0l V8 will be mated to the new 10-speed transmission. These 3 engines will also all feature the stop/start technology which was previously only available with the 2.7L, further improving mileage across the board.[15]\nFord is also introducing its first Diesel engine in an F-150, which they're calling the \"Power Stroke\" engine. The Diesel engine is a twin turbocharged 3.0L V6 from the \"Lion\" lineup of engines shared by PSA Peugot Citro\u00c3\u00abn and Jaguar Land Rover. The engine will produce 440 lb-ft of torque and be mated to the new 10-speed transmission, and also feature the stop/start technology.[15][16][17]\nOutside of new engine features, Ford has stopped offering the Sony stereo system as an option and replaced it with B&O PLAY, a sound system designed by Danish audio system manufacturer Bang & Olufsen.[15]\nExact mileage improvements have not been announced yet. This model will be expected to launch in the Fall of 2017, and will be American built at both the Dearborn Truck Plant in Michigan, and the Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri.[16] The F-150 is assembled at a speed of one per minute.[18]\nThroughout its production, variants of the Ford F-Series has been produced to attract buyers. While these variants primarily consist of trim packages, others are high-performance versions while other variants were designed with various means of improving functionality.\nFor 1961 into part of the 1963 model year, Ford offered the F-Series with a pickup bed integrated with the cab (similar to the Ford Ranchero). While still produced on a separate frame, the design simplified assembly and streamlined the exterior design of the pickup\nIntroduced in 1961, the Camper Special was an option package for F-Series trucks; designed for owners of slide-in truck campers, the Camper Special featured pre-wiring for the camper, heavy-duty transmission and engine cooling, and a larger alternator. Introduced for 1968, the Contractor's Special and Farm and Ranch Special featured toolboxes and heavy-duty suspension; the Explorer Special was a lower-priced version of the Ranger trim level.\nDuring the 1980 redesign of the F-Series, these options were no longer continued as part of the F-Series.\nSold from 1991 to 1992 on the Ford F-150 XLT Lariat, the Nite special edition was an monochromatic option package, featuring black paint and trim with a multicolor accent stripe. For 1991, it was exclusive to the regular-cab F-150; for 1992, it was available on all bodystyles of the F-150 and introduced on the Ford Bronco.\nThe Nite edition was available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive with either the 5.0L or 5.8L V8; it also included a sport suspension and alloy wheels on 235/75R15 white-letter tires.\nFor 1994, Ford introduced the Eddie Bauer trim level for the F-150. In a fashion similar to the same trim packages on the Aerostar, Bronco, and Explorer/Bronco II, it consisted of outdoors-themed interior trim with two-tone exterior paint.\nIntroduced as a 1993 model, the Ford SVT Lightning is a high-performance version of the F-150 produced by the Ford Special Vehicle Team (SVT).\nIntended as a competitor for the Chevrolet 454SS, the SVT Lightning shared much of its structure with the F-150, but extensive modifications were made to the suspension and frame in order to improve the handling. Powered by a 240\u00c2\u00a0hp version of the 5.8L V8, the Lightning used the 4-speed automatic transmission from the F-350 (normally paired with the 7.5L or Diesel V8s).\nThough being 3 seconds slower in the 0-60 than the discontinued GMC Syclone, the Lightning retained much of the towing and payload capacity of its F-150 counterpart.\nThe Lightning was produced from 1993 to 1995; it was discontinued as Ford began design work on the 1997 F-150.\nFor 1999, the SVT Lightning returned after a three-year hiatus. As with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the design of the Lightning used the F-150 as a basis with a number of suspension modifications. Instead of a model-specific engine, the Lightning now used the 5.4L engine from the F-150; fitted with a supercharger, it produced 360\u00a0hp (increased to 380\u00a0hp in 2001). As before, the transmission was borrowed from the F-350 Diesel pickups.\nIn 2004, the Lightning was discontinued, as it was not included in the redesigned F-150 model line.\nFrom 2000 to 2012, the Harley-Davidson Edition was an option package available on the F-150 (also the F-250/F-350 from 2004-2011). Primarily an appearance package featuring monochromatic black trim, from 2002 to 2003, the edition included a slightly detuned version of the supercharged 5.4L V8 engine from the SVT Lightning. In 2003, a 100th Anniversary Edition was produced on F-150 SuperCrews.\nAfter 2008, the option package adopted many of the options featured from the Platinum trim level, featuring leather seating produced from materials reserved for Harley-Davidson biker jackets.[19] For 2012, the Harley-Davidson Edition was replaced by the Limited trim level.\nFor 2010, Ford introduced its second high-performance truck, the SVT Raptor. In sharp contrast to the SVT Lightning, the Raptor is based on Ford's 1000 baja truck, with modifications designed to improve its on-road performance while still including standard Fox suspension, and the most capable off-road, mass-produced vehicle available. For the 2010 model year, the base engine was a 5.4 Liter V8 producing 310\u00a0hp (230\u00a0kW), the 6.2 Liter V8 was an option added mid year. Between 2011 and 2014, a 411\u00a0hp (306\u00a0kW), 6.2 Liter V8, both were paired with a six-speed automatic was available. The Raptor features a model-exclusive suspension with long-travel springs and shocks. To make room for its larger tires, the Raptor shares only the cab with a standard F-150; the pickup bed, hood and front fenders are wider and exclusive to the model. Initially available only as a SuperCab, a SuperCrew cab was added in late 2010.\nFor the first time on a Ford in North America since 1983, the word \"Ford\" was spelled on the grille of the SVT Raptor in place of the Ford Blue Oval badge.\nIn late 2016, the second-generation Ford Raptor (dropping the SVT prefix) returned as a 2017 model. The 2017 Ford Raptor is based on the aluminum-body Ford F-150 introduced for 2015. In a major change, the powertrain sourced from the Ford Super Duty is replaced by a re-engineered 3.5 Liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 paired with an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission.[20]\nFollowing the 2008 discontinuation of the Lincoln Mark LT in the United States and Canada,[21] the truck remained in production in Mexico until 2014.\nFor 2009, to replace the Mark LT, Ford moved into the luxury pickup truck segment with the Platinum trim level. Combining much of the content and luxury features of the Mark LT with more subdued styling, the F-150 Platinum saw more success than either the Lincoln Blackwood or Lincoln Mark LT. In 2013, the Platinum trim level was expanded to the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty pickup trucks.\nFor the 2014 model year, Ford introduced the Tremor model of the F-150. The Tremor was released as high-performance sport truck for street truck enthusiasts. The regular-cab Tremor is based on the style of the FX Appearance Package with the 3.5 Liter EcoBoost engine and a 4.10 rear axle. The interior uses a console-mounted shifter, custom bucket seats and a flow-through center console not found in any other F-150. The Tremor is available in both 4x2 and 4x4. Both options feature an electronic locking rear differential and customized suspension. There were 2,230 Tremors built.[citation needed]\nThe truck won the San Felipe 250 eight times between 1999 and 2007.\nGreg Biffle won the 2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.\nDrivers such as Roger Norman and Larry Roeseler won the Primm 300 in 2003, 2007 and 2008.\nIn 2008, Ford announced its entrance into the Baja 1000 class-eight race for moderately modified, full-size pickups. The driver of record was Steve Oligos, supported by co-drivers Randy Merritt, Greg Foutz, and Bud Brutsman.[22] The vehicle was built with collaboration between the Ford Special Vehicle Team (SVT), Ford Racing, and Foutz Motorsports, Inc. The Ford F-150 SVT Raptor R completed the 2008 41st Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 race in 25.28:10,[23] and ranked third in its class.[24] Tavo Vildosola and Gus Vildosola won the event in 2010.\nIn the Best in the Desert race series, an F-150 SVT Raptor R completed the \"Terrible's 250\" race, placing second overall in the class 8000.[25]\nIn January 2010, a single Raptor SVT (No. 439), driven by Chilean driver Javier Campillay, competed in the Argentina-Chile Dakar Rally. However, the pickup was unable to finish due to a catch-up crash with another car in the middle of the road during stage seven. In January 2011, two Raptors started in the Argentina-Chile Dakar Rally in Buenos Aires, with Campillay driving the more reliable Raptor (No. 375), and American female driver Sue Mead driving a T2 Raptor (No. 374). Mead crossed the finish line in Buenos Aires and won the \"super production\" class, the first North American class win in Dakar history. Campillay was unable to finish the 12th stage after losing time due to mechanical failure during the 11th stage, which led to his disqualification for failing to reach the race camp by the designated deadline.\nThe Ford F-150 has won numerous awards; in 2009 alone, it received:[26]\nQuantities of Ford F-Series sold.\nFor most of its production, the F-Series was sold in a medium-duty conventional truck configuration alongside the traditional pickup trucks. Beginning in 1948 with the 1\u00c2\u00bd ton F-5 (later F-500), the medium-duty trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800). Prior to the 1957 introduction of the Ford C-Series tilt-cab, the medium-duty range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.\nFollowing the introduction of the fifth-generation F-Series in 1967, the medium-duty trucks were designed separately from the pickup truck range. Although remaining part of the F-Series range, the medium-duty trucks shared only the cab and interior with the F-Series pickup trucks. Since 1967, the cab design has changed only in 1980 and in 2000. Redesigned on an all-new chassis, the 2017 F-Series medium-duty trucks retain an updated version of the 2000-2016 F-650/F750 cab.\nThe medium-duty F-Series served as the donor platform for the B-Series cowled bus chassis produced from 1948 to 1998. Produced primarily for school bus bodies, the B-Series was discontinued as part of the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner in 1996.\nAbove its medium-duty truck ranges, the Ford F-Series was used as a heavy-truck chassis during its early production. In 1951, Ford debuted its \"Big Job\" line, denoting the F-8 conventional.[44] In 1958, the \"Super Duty\" and \"Extra Heavy Duty\" replaced the Big Job trucks, marking the debut of the Super Duty V8 engine line.[45] In 1963, the N-Series became the first short-hood conventional built by Ford, replacing the F-900 Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty. Although based on an all-new chassis and separate bodywork, the cab was sourced from the F-Series.\nIn 1970, Ford introduced the L-Series \"Louisville\" line of conventional trucks, moving all heavy truck development away from the F-Series. The L-Series/Aeromax would remain in production through 1998, as Ford exited the heavy-truck segment.\nFrom 1948 until 1960, Ford manufactured the F-Series in a panel van configuration, largely replacing it with the Econoline in 1961. In contrast to General Motors, the panel van was never produced in a passenger \"carryall\" variant, such as the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban.\nFor much of its production life, the Ford E-Series vans shared a high degree of mechanical commonality with the F-Series; in the late 1970s, some body components were shared. Since the 1990s, this changed somewhat, as Ford updated the F-Series several times since 1992 while the E-Series continued on with very few changes; no powertrains were shared as of 2016.\nAs of 2018, outside of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the Ford F-150 is officially sold in most Caribbean countries (except Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Cuba), Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), Iceland, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, the Dutch territories of Aruba, Cura\u00c3\u00a7ao, Saint Maarten and the British overseas territory of the Cayman Islands. The SVT Raptor is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), China, Ecuador, Chile and Peru. Both are available in LHD only.\nIn Mexico, the F-150 (XLT and higher trim levels) is called the \"Ford Lobo\" while the F-150 SVT Raptor is called the \"Ford Lobo Raptor\". The F-150 XL is called F-150 XL.\nThere is a strong grey market presence of Ford F-Series trucks around the world, most notably in Europe, China, and Australia, and usually driven by wealthy car enthusiasts, as the higher end trim models are the most sought-after versions.\nIn Bolivia, Ford F-series truck are imported from the United States. F-150 single, super cab and crew cab are available with short and long bed. F-series Heavy Duty like F-250, F-350 are available in Super Cab and Crew cab with long bed, but the F-450 is available only in a chassis version. The F-150 Raptor is available, too.\nIn Australia, Ford F-series trucks are imported and converted to right-hand drive by several Australian importers, mostly by the Harrison Motoring Group, which as become the largest importer of F-Series vehicles in the Southern Hemisphere. Harrison F-Trucks have become Australia's number one converter and supplier of the famous Ford F-Series badges.\nIn the United Kingdom, most imported Ford F-Series trucks are the F-150 model, and usually the higher-end four door versions.\nRight-hand drive versions of the F-Series for the United Kingdom and Australia were manufactured in Brazil.\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the petrol engines are often converted to also run with alternative fuels, E-96h (Brazilian-spec ethanol) and compressed natural gas (CNG). Biodiesel also is used in Diesel engines.[citation needed]\nThe addition of the 3.0l V6 turbo diesel engine could potentially make the Ford F-150 go global and in both LHD and RHD from the factory.",

        "text": "The history of Linux began in 1991 with the commencement of a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel. Since then, the resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.2.3 version in 2015 with more than 18 million lines of source code under the GNU General Public License v2.[1](p7)[2][3]\nAfter AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.[4][5]\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[6] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.[7]\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System.[8] This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.[9]\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own.[10][11]\nIn 1991, while studying computer science at University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds began a project that later became the Linux kernel. He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor. Development was done on MINIX using the GNU C compiler. The GNU C Compiler is still the main choice for compiling Linux today. The code however, can be built with other compilers, such as the Intel C Compiler.\nAs Torvalds wrote in his book Just for Fun,[12] he eventually ended up writing an operating system kernel. On 25 August 1991, he (at age 21) announced this system in a Usenet posting to the newsgroup \"comp.os.minix.\":[13]\nHello everybody out there using minix -\nI'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).\nI've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them\u00c2\u00a0:-)\nLinus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)\nLinus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention Freax, a portmanteau of \"free\", \"freak\", and \"x\" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, he stored the files under the name \"Freax\" for about half of a year. Torvalds had already considered the name \"Linux,\" but initially dismissed it as too egotistical.[12]\nIn order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke at Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that \"Freax\" was a good name. So, he named the project \"Linux\" on the server without consulting Torvalds.[12] Later, however, Torvalds consented to \"Linux\".\nTo demonstrate how the word \"Linux\" should be pronounced ([\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0275ks]), Torvalds included an audio guide (\u00a0listen\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) with the kernel source code.[15]\nTorvalds first published the Linux kernel under its own licence,[16] which had a restriction on commercial activity.\nThe software to use with the kernel was software developed as part of the GNU project licensed under the GNU General Public License, a free software license. The first release of the Linux kernel, Linux 0.01, included a binary of GNU's Bash shell.[17]\nIn the \"Notes for linux release 0.01\", Torvalds lists the GNU software that is required to run Linux:[17]\nSadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere. To get a working system you need a shell, compilers, a library etc. These are separate parts and may be under a stricter (or even looser) copyright. Most of the tools used with linux are GNU software and are under the GNU copyleft. These tools aren't in the distribution - ask me (or GNU) for more info.[17]\nIn 1992, he suggested releasing the kernel under the GNU General Public License. He first announced this decision in the release notes of version 0.12.[18] In the middle of December 1992 he published version 0.99 using the GNU GPL.[19] Linux and GNU developers worked to integrate GNU components with Linux to make a fully functional and free operating system.[20] Torvalds has stated, \"making Linux GPL'd was definitely the best thing I ever did.\"[21]\nAround 2000 Torvalds clarified that the used license for the linux kernel is exactly the GPLv2, without the common \"or later clause\".[2][3]\nIn 2007, after years of draft discussions, the GPLv3 was released and Torvalds and the majority of kernel developers decided against adopting the new license for the linux kernel.[22][23][24]\nThe designation \"Linux\" was initially used by Torvalds only for the Linux kernel. The kernel was, however, frequently used together with other software, especially that of the GNU project. This quickly became the most popular adoption of GNU software. In June 1994 in GNU's bulletin, Linux was referred to as a \"free UNIX clone\", and the Debian project began calling its product Debian GNU/Linux. In May 1996, Richard Stallman published the editor Emacs 19.31, in which the type of system was renamed from Linux to Lignux. This spelling was intended to refer specifically to the combination of GNU and Linux, but this was soon abandoned in favor of \"GNU/Linux\".[citation needed]\nThis name garnered varying reactions. The GNU and Debian projects use the name, although most people simply use the term \"Linux\" to refer to the combination.[25]\nTorvalds announced in 1996 that there would be a mascot for Linux, a penguin. This was due to the fact when they were about to select the mascot, Torvalds mentioned he was bitten by a little penguin (Eudyptula minor) on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium in Canberra, Australia. Larry Ewing provided the original draft of today's well known mascot based on this description. The name Tux was suggested by James Hughes as derivative of Torvalds' UniX, along with being short for tuxedo, a type of suit with color similar to that of a penguin.[12][page\u00c2\u00a0needed]\nThe largest part of the work on Linux is performed by the community: the thousands of programmers around the world that use Linux and send their suggested improvements to the maintainers. Various companies have also helped not only with the development of the kernels, but also with the writing of the body of auxiliary software, which is distributed with Linux. As of February 2015, over 80% of Linux kernel developers are paid.[1](p11)\nIt is released both by organized projects such as Debian, and by projects connected directly with companies such as Fedora and openSUSE. The members of the respective projects meet at various conferences and fairs, in order to exchange ideas. One of the largest of these fairs is the LinuxTag in Germany, where about 10,000 people assemble annually, in order to discuss Linux and the projects associated with it.[citation needed]\nThe Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) was created in the year 2000, and is an independent nonprofit organization which pursues the goal of optimizing Linux for employment in data centers and in the carrier range. It served as sponsored working premises for Linus Torvalds and also for Andrew Morton (until the middle of 2006 when Morton transferred to Google). Torvalds worked full-time on behalf of OSDL, developing the Linux kernels.\nOn 22 January 2007, OSDL and the Free Standards Group merged to form The Linux Foundation, narrowing their respective focuses to that of promoting Linux in competition with Microsoft Windows.[26][27] As of 2015, Torvalds remains with the Linux Foundation as a Fellow.[28]\nDespite being freely available, companies profit from Linux. These companies, many of which are also members of the Linux Foundation, invest substantial resources into the advancement and development of Linux, in order to make it suited for various application areas. This includes hardware donations for driver developers, cash donations for people who develop Linux software, and the employment of Linux programmers at the company. Some examples are Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, which validate, use and sell Linux on their own servers, and Red Hat and SUSE, which maintain their own enterprise distributions. Likewise, Digia supports Linux by the development and LGPL licensing of Qt, which makes the development of KDE possible, and by employing some of the X and KDE developers.\nKDE was the first advanced desktop environment, but it was controversial due to the then-proprietary Qt toolkit used.[29] GNOME was developed as an alternative due to licensing questions.[29] The two use a different underlying toolkit and thus involve different programming, and are sponsored by two different groups, German nonprofit KDE e.V. and the United States nonprofit GNOME Foundation.\nAs of April 2007, one journalist estimated that KDE had 65% of market share versus 26% for GNOME.[29] In January 2008, KDE 4 was released prematurely with bugs, driving some users to GNOME.[30] GNOME 3, released in April 2011, was called an \"unholy mess\" by Linus Torvalds due to its controversial design changes.[31]\nDissatisfaction with GNOME 3 led to a fork, Cinnamon, which is developed primarily by Linux Mint developer Clement LeFebvre. This restores the more traditional desktop environment with marginal improvements.\nThe relatively well-funded distribution, Ubuntu, designed (and released in June 2011) another user interface called Unity which is radically different from the conventional desktop environment and has been criticized as having various flaws[32] and lacking configurability.[33] The motivation was a single desktop environment for desktops and tablets,[citation needed] although as of November 2012 Unity has yet to be used widely in tablets. However, the smartphone and tablet version of Ubuntu and its Unity interface was unveiled by Canonical Ltd in January 2013.\nIn 1992, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, recognized computer scientist and author of the Minix microkernel system, wrote a Usenet article on the newsgroup comp.os.minix with the title \"Linux is obsolete\",[34] which marked the beginning of a famous debate about the structure of the then-recent Linux kernel. Among the most significant criticisms were that:\nTanenbaum's prediction that Linux would become outdated within a few years and replaced by GNU Hurd (which he considered to be more modern) proved incorrect. Linux has been ported to all major platforms and its open development model has led to an exemplary pace of development. In contrast, GNU Hurd has not yet reached the level of stability that would allow it to be used on a production server.[38] His dismissal of the Intel line of 386 processors as 'weird' has also proven short-sighted, as the x86 series of processors and the Intel Corporation would later become near ubiquitous in personal computers and servers.\nIn his unpublished book Samizdat, Kenneth Brown claims that Torvalds illegally copied code from MINIX. In May 2004, these claims were refuted by Tanenbaum, the author of MINIX:[39]\n[Brown] wanted to go on about the ownership issue, but he was also trying to avoid telling me what his real purpose was, so he didn't phrase his questions very well. Finally he asked me if I thought Linus wrote Linux. I said that to the best of my knowledge, Linus wrote the whole kernel himself, but after it was released, other people began improving the kernel, which was very primitive initially, and adding new software to the system--essentially the same development model as MINIX. Then he began to focus on this, with questions like: \"Didn't he steal pieces of MINIX without permission.\" I told him that MINIX had clearly had a huge influence on Linux in many ways, from the layout of the file system to the names in the source tree, but I didn't think Linus had used any of my code.\nThe book's claims, methodology and references were seriously questioned and in the end it was never released and was delisted from the distributor's site.\nAlthough Torvalds has said that Microsoft's feeling threatened by Linux in the past was of no consequence to him, the Microsoft and Linux camps had a number of antagonistic interactions between 1997 and 2001. This became quite clear for the first time in 1998, when the first Halloween document was brought to light by Eric S. Raymond. This was a short essay by a Microsoft developer that sought to lay out the threats posed to Microsoft by free software and identified strategies to counter these perceived threats.[citation needed]\nCompetition entered a new phase in the beginning of 2004, when Microsoft published results from customer case studies evaluating the use of Windows vs. Linux under the name \u201cGet the Facts\u201d on its own web page. Based on inquiries, research analysts, and some Microsoft sponsored investigations, the case studies claimed that enterprise use of Linux on servers compared unfavorably to the use of Windows in terms of reliability, security, and total cost of ownership.[40]\nIn response, commercial Linux distributors produced their own studies, surveys and testimonials to counter Microsoft's campaign. Novell's web-based campaign at the end of 2004 was entitled \u201cUnbending the truth\u201d and sought to outline the advantages as well as dispelling the widely publicized legal liabilities of Linux deployment (particularly in light of the SCO v IBM case). Novell particularly referenced the Microsoft studies in many points. IBM also published a series of studies under the title \u201cThe Linux at IBM competitive advantage\u201d to again parry Microsoft's campaign. Red Hat had a campaign called \u201cTruth Happens\u201d aimed at letting the performance of the product speak for itself, rather than advertising the product by studies.[citation needed]\nIn the autumn of 2006, Novell and Microsoft announced an agreement to co-operate on software interoperability and patent protection.[41] This included an agreement that customers of either Novell or Microsoft may not be sued by the other company for patent infringement. This patent protection was also expanded to non-commercial free software developers. The last part was criticized because it only included non-commercial free software developers.\nIn July 2009, Microsoft submitted 22,000 lines of source code to the Linux kernel under the GPLV2 license, which were subsequently accepted. Although this has been referred to as \"a historic move\" and as a possible bellwether of an improvement in Microsoft's corporate attitudes toward Linux and open-source software, the decision was not altogether altruistic, as it promised to lead to significant competitive advantages for Microsoft and avoided legal action against Microsoft. Microsoft was actually compelled to make the code contribution when Vyatta principal engineer and Linux contributor Stephen Hemminger discovered that Microsoft had incorporated a Hyper-V network driver, with GPL-licensed open source components, statically linked to closed-source binaries in contravention of the GPL licence. Microsoft contributed the drivers to rectify the licence violation, although the company attempted to portray it as a charitable act, rather than one to avoid legal action against it. In the past Microsoft had termed Linux a \"cancer\" and \"communist\".[42][43][44][45][46]\nBy 2011, Microsoft had become the 17th largest contributor to the Linux kernel.[47] As of February 2015, Microsoft was no longer among the top 30 contributing sponsor companies.[1](pp10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12)\nIn March 2003, the SCO Group accused IBM of violating their copyright on UNIX by transferring code from UNIX to Linux. SCO claims ownership of the copyrights on UNIX and a lawsuit was filed against IBM. Red Hat has countersued and SCO has since filed other related lawsuits. At the same time as their lawsuit, SCO began selling Linux licenses to users who did not want to risk a possible complaint on the part of SCO. Since Novell also claims the copyrights to UNIX, it filed suit against SCO.\nSCO has since filed for bankruptcy.[48]\nIn 1994 and 1995, several people from different countries attempted to register the name \"Linux\" as a trademark. Thereupon requests for royalty payments were issued to several Linux companies, a step with which many developers and users of Linux did not agree. Linus Torvalds clamped down on these companies with help from Linux International and was granted the trademark to the name, which he transferred to Linux International. Protection of the trademark was later administered by a dedicated foundation, the non-profit Linux Mark Institute. In 2000, Linus Torvalds specified the basic rules for the assignment of the licenses. This means that anyone who offers a product or a service with the name Linux must possess a license for it, which can be obtained through a unique purchase.\nIn June 2005, a new controversy developed over the use of royalties generated from the use of the Linux trademark. The Linux Mark Institute, which represents Linus Torvalds' rights, announced a price increase from 500 to 5,000 dollars for the use of the name. This step was justified as being needed to cover the rising costs of trademark protection.\nIn response to this increase, the community became displeased, which is why Linus Torvalds made an announcement on 21 August 2005, in order to dissolve the misunderstandings. In an e-mail he described the current situation as well as the background in detail and also dealt with the question of who had to pay license costs:\n[...] And let\u2019s repeat: somebody who doesn\u2019t want to _protect_ that name would never do this. You can call anything \"MyLinux\", but the downside is that you may have somebody else who _did_ protect himself come along and send you a cease-and-desist letter. Or, if the name ends up showing up in a trademark search that LMI needs to do every once in a while just to protect the trademark (another legal requirement for trademarks), LMI itself might have to send you a cease-and-desist-or-sublicense it letter.\nAt which point you either rename it to something else, or you sublicense it. See? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about whether _you_ need the protection or not, not about whether LMI wants the money or not.\nThe Linux Mark Institute has since begun to offer a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense.[50]",

        "text": "Prehistoric Ireland spans a period from the first known evidence of human presence dated to about 10,000 years ago until the emergence of \"protohistoric\" Gaelic Ireland at the time of Christianization in the 5th century. Christianity subsumed or replaced the earlier polytheism and other forms of Celtic paganism by the end of the 7th century.\nThe Norman invasion of the late 12th century marked the beginning of more than 800 years of direct English rule and, later, British involvement in Ireland. In 1177 Prince John Lackland was made Lord of Ireland by his father Henry II of England at the Council of Oxford.[1] The Crown did not attempt to assert full control of the island until the rebellion of the Earl of Kildare threatened English hegemony. Henry VIII proclaimed himself King of Ireland and also tried to introduce the English Reformation, which failed in Ireland. Attempts to either conquer or assimilate the Irish lordships into the Kingdom of Ireland provided the initial impetus for a series of Irish military campaigns between 1534 and 1603. This period was marked by a Crown policy of plantation, involving the arrival of thousands of English and Scottish Protestant settlers, and the consequent displacement of the pre-plantation Catholic landholders. As the military and political defeat of Gaelic Ireland became more pronounced in the early seventeenth century, sectarian conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\nThe 1614 overthrow of the Catholic majority in the Irish Parliament was realised principally through the creation of numerous new boroughs which were dominated by the new settlers. By the end of the seventeenth century, recusants (as adherents to the older religion were now termed), representing some 85% of Ireland's population, were then banned from the Irish Parliament. Protestant domination of Ireland was confirmed after two periods of war between Catholics and Protestants in 1641-52 and 1689-91. Political power thereafter rested entirely in the hands of a Protestant Ascendancy minority, while Catholics and members of dissenting Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations under the Penal Laws. The Irish Parliament was abolished from 1 January 1801 in the wake of the republican United Irishmen Rebellion and Ireland became an integral part of a new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the provisions of the Acts of Union 1800. Although promised a repeal of the Test Act, Catholics were not granted full rights until Catholic Emancipation was attained throughout the new UK in 1829. This was followed by the first Irish Reform Act 1832, a principal condition of which was the removal of the poorer Irish freeholders from the franchise.\nThe Irish Parliamentary Party strove from the 1880s to attain Home Rule through the parliamentary constitutional movement, eventually winning the Home Rule Act 1914, although this Act was suspended at the outbreak of World War I. The Easter Rising staged by republicans two years later brought physical force republicanism back to the forefront of Irish politics.\nIn 1922, after the Irish War of Independence and the Anglo-Irish Treaty, most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to become the independent Irish Free State, which after the 1937 constitution, began to call itself Ireland. The six northeastern counties, known as Northern Ireland, remained within the United Kingdom. The Irish Civil War followed soon after the War of Independence. The history of Northern Ireland has since been dominated by sporadic sectarian conflict between (mainly Catholic) Irish nationalists and (mainly Protestant) unionists. This conflict erupted into the Troubles in the late 1960s, until peace was achieved with the Belfast Agreement thirty years later.\nWhat is known of pre-Christian Ireland comes from references in Roman writings, Irish poetry and myth, and archaeology. While some possible Paleolithic tools have been found, none of the finds are convincing of Paleolithic settlement in Ireland.[2] However a bear bone found in Alice and Gwendoline Cave, County Clare, in 1903 may push back dates for the earliest human settlement of Ireland to 10,500 BC. The bone shows clear signs of cut marks with stone tools, and has been radiocarbon dated to 12,500 years ago.[3]\nThe earliest confirmed inhabitants of Ireland were Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, who arrived some time around 7900 BC.[4] While some authors take the view that a land bridge connecting Ireland to Great Britain still existed at that time,[5] more recent studies indicate that Ireland was separated from Britain by c. 14,000 BC, when the climate was still cold and local ice caps persisted in parts of the country.[6] The people remained hunter-gatherers until about 4000 BC. It is argued this is when the first signs of agriculture started to show, leading to the establishment of a Neolithic culture, characterised by the appearance of pottery, polished stone tools, rectangular wooden houses, megalithic tombs, and domesticated sheep and cattle.[7] Some of these tombs, as at Knowth and Dowth, are huge stone monuments and many of them, such as the Passage Tombs of Newgrange, are astronomically aligned. Four main types of Irish Megalithic Tombs have been identified: dolmens, court cairns, passage tombs and wedge-shaped gallery graves.[7] In Leinster and Munster, individual adult males were buried in small stone structures, called cists, under earthen mounds and were accompanied by distinctive decorated pottery. This culture apparently prospered, and the island became more densely populated. Near the end of the Neolithic new types of monuments developed, such as circular embanked enclosures and timber, stone and post and pit circles.\nThe Bronze Age, which came to Ireland around 2000 BC, saw the production of elaborate gold and bronze ornaments, weapons and tools. There was a movement away from the construction of communal megalithic tombs to the burial of the dead in small stone cists or simple pits, which could be situated in cemeteries or in circular earth or stone built burial mounds known respectively as barrows and cairns. As the period progressed, inhumation burial gave way to cremation and by the Middle Bronze Age, remains were often placed beneath large burial urns.\nThe Iron Age in Ireland began about 600 BC. The period between the start of the Iron Age and the historic period (431 AD) saw the gradual infiltration of small groups of Celtic-speaking people into Ireland,[8][9] with items of the continental Celtic La Tene style being found in at least the northern part of the island by about 300 BC.[10][11] The result of a gradual blending of Celtic and indigenous cultures would result in the emergence of Gaelic culture by the fifth century.[8][12] It is also during the fifth century that the main over-kingdoms of In Tuisceart, Airgialla, Ulaid, Mide, Laigin, Mumhain, C\u00c3\u00b3iced Ol nEchmacht began to emerge (see Kingdoms of ancient Ireland). Within these kingdoms a rich culture flourished. The society of these kingdoms was dominated by an upper class consisting of aristocratic warriors and learned people, which possibly included Druids.\nLinguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the Goidelic languages, was a branch of the Celtic languages. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by Celts from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.[13][14]\nThe hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.[15][need quotation to verify]\nThe Romans referred to Ireland as Hibernia. Ptolemy, in 100 AD, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. Tacitus writes that an exiled Irish prince was with Agricola in Roman Britain and would return to seize power in Ireland. Juvenal tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around 100 AD,[16] but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear.\nIrish confederations (the Scoti) attacked and some settled in Britain during the Great Conspiracy of 367. In particular, the D\u00e1l Riata settled in western Scotland and the Western Isles.\nThe middle centuries of the first millennium AD marked great changes in Ireland. Politically, what appears to have been a prehistoric emphasis on tribal affiliation had been replaced by the 8th century by patrilineal dynasties ruling the island's kingdoms. Many formerly powerful kingdoms and peoples disappeared. Irish pirates struck all over the coast of western Britain in the same way that the Vikings would later attack Ireland. Some of these founded entirely new kingdoms in Pictland and, to a lesser degree, in parts of Cornwall, Wales, and Cumbria. The Attacotti of south Leinster may even have served in the Roman military in the mid-to-late 300s.[17]\nPerhaps it was some of the latter returning home as rich mercenaries, merchants, or slaves stolen from Britain or Gaul, that first brought the Christian faith to Ireland. Some early sources claim that there were missionaries active in southern Ireland long before St. Patrick. Whatever the route, and there were probably many, this new faith was to have the most profound effect on the Irish.\nTradition maintains that in A.D. 432, St. Patrick arrived on the island and, in the years that followed, worked to convert the Irish to Christianity. St Patrick's Confession, in Latin, written by him is the earliest Irish historical document. It gives some information about the Saint.[18] On the other hand, according to Prosper of Aquitaine, a contemporary chronicler, Palladius was sent to Ireland by the Pope in 431 as \"first Bishop to the Irish believing in Christ\", which demonstrates that there were already Christians living in Ireland. Palladius seems to have worked purely as Bishop to Irish Christians in the Leinster and Meath kingdoms, while Patrick \u2013 who may have arrived as late as 461 \u2013 worked first and foremost as a missionary to the pagan Irish, in the more remote kingdoms in Ulster and Connacht.\nPatrick is traditionally credited with preserving and codifying Irish laws and changing only those that conflicted with Christian practices. He is credited with introducing the Roman alphabet, which enabled Irish monks to preserve parts of the extensive oral literature. The historicity of these claims remains the subject of debate and there is no direct evidence linking Patrick with any of these accomplishments. The myth of Patrick, as scholars refer to it, was developed in the centuries after his death.[19]\nIrish scholars excelled in the study of Latin learning and Christian theology in the monasteries that flourished shortly thereafter. Missionaries from Ireland to England and Continental Europe spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the Early Middle Ages. The period of Insular art, mainly in the fields of illuminated manuscripts, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice, and the many carved stone crosses that dot the island. Insular style was to be a crucial ingredient in the formation of the Romanesque and Gothic styles throughout Western Europe. Sites dating to this period include clochans, ringforts and promontory forts.\nFrancis John Byrne describes the effect of the epidemics which occurred during this era:\nThe plagues of the 660s and the 680s had a traumatic effect on Irish society. The golden age of the saints was over, together with the generation of kings who could fire a saga-writer's imagination. The literary tradition looks back to the reign of the sons of Aed Slaine (Diarmait and Blathmac, who died in 665) as to the end of an era. Antiquaries, brehons, genealogists and hagiographers, felt the need to collect ancient traditions before they were totally forgotten. Many were in fact swallowed by oblivion; when we examine the writing of Tirechan we encounter obscure references to tribes which are quite unknown to the later genealogical tradition. The laws describe a ... society that was obsolescent, and the meaning and use of the word moccu[20] dies out with archaic Old Irish at the beginning of the new century.[21]\nThe first English involvement in Ireland took place in this period. Tullylease, Rath Melsigi and Maigh Eo na Saxain were founded by 670 for English students who wished to study or live in Ireland. In summer 684, an English expeditionary force sent by Northumbrian King Ecgfrith raided Brega.\nThe first recorded Viking raid in Irish history occurred in 795 AD when Vikings from Norway looted the island. Early Viking raids were generally fast-paced and small in scale. These early raids interrupted the golden age of Christian Irish culture and marked the beginning of two centuries of intermittent warfare, with waves of Viking raiders plundering monasteries and towns throughout Ireland. Most of those early raiders came from western Norway.\nThe Vikings were expert sailors, who travelled in longships, and by the early 840s AD, had begun to establish settlements along the Irish coasts and to spend the winter months there. Vikings founded settlements in several places; most famously in Dublin. Written accounts from this time (early to mid 840s) show that the Vikings were moving further inland to attack (often using rivers) and then retreating to their coastal headquarters.\nIn 852 AD, the Vikings landed in Dublin Bay and established a fortress. After several generations a group of mixed Irish and Norse ethnic background arose, the Gall-Gaels, '(Gall being the Old Irish word for foreign).\nIn 902 AD, the Vikings were pushed out of Ireland by the Irish king Muirec\u00c3\u00a1n. They were allowed by the Saxons to settle in Wirral, England, but would however later return to retake Dublin.[22] However, the Vikings never achieved total domination of Ireland, often fighting for and against various Irish kings. The Battle of Clontarf in 1014 began the decline of Viking power in Ireland but the towns which Vikings had founded continued to flourish, and trade became an important part of the Irish economy.\nBy the 12th century, Ireland was divided politically into a shifting hierarchy of petty kingdoms and over-kingdoms. Power was exercised by the heads of a few regional dynasties vying against each other for supremacy over the whole island. One of these men, King Diarmait Mac Murchada of Leinster was forcibly exiled by the new High King, Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair of the Western kingdom of Connacht. Fleeing to Aquitaine, Diarmait obtained permission from Henry II to recruit Norman knights to regain his kingdom. The first Norman knight landed in Ireland in 1167, followed by the main forces of Normans, Welsh and Flemings. Several counties were restored to the control of Diarmait, who named his son-in-law, the Norman Richard de Clare, known as Strongbow, heir to his kingdom. This troubled King Henry, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to establish his authority.\nWith the authority of the papal bull Laudabiliter from Adrian IV, Henry landed with a large fleet at Waterford in 1171, becoming the first King of England to set foot on Irish soil. Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son John with the title Dominus Hiberniae (\"Lord of Ireland\"). When John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as King John of England, the \"Lordship of Ireland\" fell directly under the English Crown.\nThe Normans initially controlled the entire east coast, from Waterford to eastern Ulster, and penetrated a considerable distance inland as well. The counties were ruled by many smaller kings. The first Lord of Ireland was King John, who visited Ireland in 1185 and 1210 and helped consolidate the Norman-controlled areas, while ensuring that the many Irish kings swore fealty to him.\nThroughout the thirteenth century the policy of the English Kings was to weaken the power of the Norman Lords in Ireland. For example, King John encouraged Hugh de Lacy to destabilise and then overthrow the Lord of Ulster, before naming him as the first Earl of Ulster. The Hiberno-Norman community suffered from a series of invasions that ceased the spread of their settlement and power. Politics and events in Gaelic Ireland served to draw the settlers deeper into the orbit of the Irish.\nBy 1261 the weakening of the Normans had become manifest when Fineen MacCarthy defeated a Norman army at the Battle of Callann. The war continued between the different lords and earls for about 100 years, causing much destruction, especially around Dublin. In this chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land that their families had lost since the conquest and held them after the war was over.\nThe Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled territory shrank to a fortified area around Dublin (the Pale), whose rulers had little real authority outside (beyond the Pale).\nBy the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had almost disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the Wars of the Roses. The Lordship of Ireland lay in the hands of the powerful Fitzgerald Earl of Kildare, who dominated the country by means of military force and alliances with Irish lords and clans. Around the country, local Gaelic and Gaelicised lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin but the power of the Dublin government was seriously curtailed by the introduction of Poynings' Law in 1494. According to this act the Irish Parliament was essentially put under the control of the Westminster Parliament.\nFrom 1536, Henry VIII decided to conquer Ireland and bring it under crown control. The Fitzgerald dynasty of Kildare, who had become the effective rulers of Ireland in the 15th century, had become unreliable allies of the Tudor monarchs. They had invited Burgundian troops into Dublin to crown the Yorkist pretender, Lambert Simnel as King of England in 1487. Again in 1536, Silken Thomas Fitzgerald went into open rebellion against the crown. Having put down this rebellion, Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. In 1541, he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full Kingdom. Henry was proclaimed King of Ireland at a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year. This was the first meeting of the Irish Parliament to be attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the Hiberno-Norman aristocracy. With the institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The Spanish Armada in Ireland suffered heavy losses during an extraordinary season of storms in the autumn of 1588. Among the survivors was Captain Francisco de Cuellar, who gave a remarkable account of his experiences on the run in Ireland.[23]\nThe re-conquest was completed during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I, after several brutal conflicts. (See the Desmond Rebellions, 1569\u201373 and 1579\u201383, and the Nine Years War, 1594\u20131603, for details.) After this point, the English authorities in Dublin established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. However, the English were not successful in converting the Catholic Irish to the Protestant religion and the brutal methods used by crown authority (including resorting to martial law) to bring the country under English control, heightened resentment of English rule.\nFrom the mid-16th to the early 17th century, crown governments carried out a policy of land confiscation and colonisation known as Plantations. Scottish and English Protestant colonists were sent to the provinces of Munster, Ulster and the counties of Laois and Offaly. These Protestant settlers replaced the Irish Catholic landowners who were removed from their lands. These settlers formed the ruling class of future British appointed administrations in Ireland. Several Penal Laws, aimed at Catholics, Baptists and Presbyterians, were introduced to encourage conversion to the established (Anglican) Church of Ireland.\nThe 17th century was perhaps the bloodiest in Ireland's history. Two periods of war (1641\u201353 and 1689\u201391) caused huge loss of life. The ultimate dispossession of most of the Irish Catholic landowning class was engineered, and recusants were subordinated under the Penal Laws.\nDuring the 17th century, Ireland was convulsed by eleven years of warfare, beginning with the Rebellion of 1641, when Irish Catholics rebelled against the domination of English and Protestant settlers. The Catholic gentry briefly ruled the country as Confederate Ireland (1642\u20131649) against the background of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms until Oliver Cromwell reconquered Ireland in 1649\u20131653 on behalf of the English Commonwealth. Cromwell's conquest was the most brutal phase of the war. By its close, up to more than a half of Ireland's pre-war population was killed or exiled as slaves, where many died due to harsh conditions. As retribution for the rebellion of 1641, the better-quality remaining lands owned by Irish Catholics were confiscated and given to British settlers. Several hundred remaining native landowners were transplanted to Connacht.\nIreland became the main battleground after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when the Catholic James II left London and the English Parliament replaced him with William of Orange. The wealthier Irish Catholics backed James to try to reverse the Penal Laws and land confiscations, whereas Protestants supported William and Mary in this \"Glorious Revolution\" to preserve their property in the country. James and William fought for the Kingdom of Ireland in the Williamite War, most famously at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, where James's outnumbered forces were defeated.\nFrom the 15th to the 18th century, Irish, English, Scots and Welsh prisoners were transported for forced labor in the Caribbean to work off their term of punishment. Even larger numbers came voluntarily as indentured servants. In the 18th century they were sent to the American colonies, and in the early 19th century to Australia.[24][25] The Irish were dehumanised by the English, described as \"savages,\" so making their displacement appear all the more justified. In 1654 the British parliament gave Oliver Cromwell a free hand to banish Irish \"undesirables\". Cromwell rounded up Catholics throughout the Irish countryside and placed them on ships bound for the Caribbean, mainly the island of Barbados. By 1655, 12,000 political prisoners had been forcibly shipped to Barbados and into indentured servitude.[26]\nThe majority of the people of Ireland were Catholic peasants; they were very poor and largely inert politically during the eighteenth century, as many of their leaders converted to Protestantism to avoid severe economic and political penalties. Nevertheless, there was a growing Catholic cultural awakening underway.[27] There were two Protestant groups. The Presbyterians in Ulster in the North lived in much better economic conditions, but had virtually no political power. Power was held by a small group of Anglo-Irish families, who were loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland. They owned the great bulk of the farmland, where the work was done by the Catholic peasants. Many of these families lived in England and were absentee landlords, whose loyalty was basically to England. The Anglo-Irish who lived in Ireland became increasingly identified as Irish nationalists, and were resentful of the English control of their island. Their spokesmen, such as Jonathan Swift and Edmund Burke, sought more local control.[28]\nJacobite resistance in Ireland was finally ended after the Battle of Aughrim in July 1691. The Penal Laws that had been relaxed somewhat after the Restoration were reinforced more thoroughly after this war, as the infant Anglo-Irish Ascendency wanted to ensure that the Irish Roman Catholics would not be in a position to repeat their rebellions. Power was held by the 5% who were Protestants belonging to the Church of Ireland. They controlled all major sectors of the Irish economy, the bulk of the farmland, the legal system, local government and held strong majorities in both houses of the Irish Parliament. They strongly distrusted the Presbyterians in Ulster, and were convinced that the Catholics should have minimal rights. They did not have full political control because the government in London had superior authority and treated Ireland like a backward colony. When the American colonies revolted in the 1770s, the Ascendency wrested multiple concessions to strengthen its power. They did not seek independence because they knew they were heavily outnumbered and ultimately depended upon the British Army to guarantee their security.[29]\nSubsequent Irish antagonism toward England was aggravated by the economic situation of Ireland in the 18th century. Some absentee landlords managed their estates inefficiently, and food tended to be produced for export rather than for domestic consumption. Two very cold winters near the end of the Little Ice Age led directly to a famine between 1740 and 1741, which killed about 400,000 people and caused over 150,000 Irish to leave the island. In addition, Irish exports were reduced by the Navigation Acts from the 1660s, which placed tariffs on Irish products entering England, but exempted English goods from tariffs on entering Ireland. Despite this most of the 18th century was relatively peaceful in comparison with the preceding two centuries, and the population doubled to over four million.\nBy the 18th century, the Anglo-Irish ruling class had come to see Ireland, not England, as their native country.[30] A Parliamentary faction led by Henry Grattan agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with Great Britain and for greater legislative independence for the Irish Parliament. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals toward enfranchising Irish Catholics. This was partially enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet become members of the Irish Parliament, or become government officials. Some were attracted to the more militant example of the French Revolution of 1789.\nPresbyterians and Dissenters too faced persecution on a lesser scale, and in 1791 a group of dissident Protestant individuals, all of whom but two were Presbyterians, held the first meeting of what would become the Society of the United Irishmen. Originally they sought to reform the Irish Parliament which was controlled by those belonging to the state church; seek Catholic Emancipation; and help remove religion from politics. When their ideals seemed unattainable they became more determined to use force to overthrow British rule and found a non-sectarian republic. Their activity culminated in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was bloodily suppressed.\nIreland was a separate kingdom ruled by King George III of Britain; he set policy for Ireland through his appointment of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland or viceroy. In practice, the viceroys lived in England and the affairs in the island were largely controlled by an elite group of Irish Protestants known as \"undertakers.\" The system changed in 1767, with the appointment of An English politician who became a very strong Viceroy. George Townshend served 1767-72 and was in residence in The Castle in Dublin. Townsend had the strong support of both the King and the British cabinet in London, and all major decisions were basically made in London. The Ascendancy complained, and obtained a series of new laws in the 1780s that made the Irish Parliament effective and independent of the British Parliament, although still under the supervision of the king and his Privy Council.[31]\nLargely in response to the 1798 rebellion, Irish self-government was ended altogether by the provisions of the Acts of Union 1800 (which abolished the Irish Parliament of that era).[32]\nIn 1800, following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Irish and the British parliaments enacted the Acts of Union. The merger created a new political entity called United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Part of the agreement forming the basis of union was that the Test Act would be repealed to remove any remaining discrimination against Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Baptists and other dissenter religions in the newly United Kingdom. However, King George III, invoking the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701 controversially and adamantly blocked attempts by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Pitt resigned in protest, but his successor Henry Addington and his new cabinet failed to legislate to repeal or change the Test Act.\nIn 1823 an enterprising Catholic lawyer, Daniel O'Connell, known in Ireland as 'The Liberator' began an ultimately successful Irish campaign to achieve emancipation, and to be seated in the Parliament. This culminated in O'Connell's successful election in the Clare by-election, which revived the parliamentary efforts at reform. The Catholic Relief Act 1829 was eventually approved by the UK parliament under the leadership of the Dublin-born Prime Minister, the Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. This indefatigable Anglo-Irish statesman, a former Chief Secretary for Ireland, and hero of the Napoleonic Wars, successfully guided the legislation through both houses of Parliament. By threatening to resign, he persuaded King George IV to sign the bill into law in 1829. The continuing obligation of Roman Catholics to fund the established Church of Ireland, however, led to the sporadic skirmishes of the Tithe War of 1831\u00e2\u20ac\u201c38. The Church was disestablished by the Gladstone government in 1867. The continuing enactment of parliamentary reform during the ensuing administrations further extended the initially limited franchise. Daniel O'Connell M.P. later led the Repeal Association in an unsuccessful campaign to undo the Act of Union 1800.[33]\nThe second of Ireland's \"Great Famines\", An Gorta M\u00f3r struck the country during 1845\u201349, with potato blight, exacerbated by the political factors of the time[34] leading to mass starvation and emigration. (See Great Irish Famine) The impact of emigration in Ireland was severe; the population dropped from over 8 million before the Famine to 4.4 million in 1911. Gaelic or Irish, once the island's spoken language, declined in use sharply in the nineteenth century as a result of the Famine and the creation of the National School education system, as well as hostility to the language from leading Irish politicians of the time; it was largely replaced by English.\nOutside mainstream nationalism, a series of violent rebellions by Irish republicans took place in 1803, under Robert Emmet; in 1848 a rebellion by the Young Irelanders, most prominent among them, Thomas Francis Meagher; and in 1867, another insurrection by the Irish Republican Brotherhood. All failed, but physical force nationalism remained an undercurrent in the nineteenth century.\nThe late 19th century witnessed major land reform, spearheaded by the Land League under Michael Davitt demanding what became known as the 3 Fs; Fair rent, free sale, fixity of tenure. Parliament passed laws in 1870, 1881, 1903 and 1909 that enabled most tenant farmers to purchase their lands, and lowered the rents of the others.[35] From 1870 and as a result of the Land War agitations and subsequent Plan of Campaign of the 1880s, various British governments introduced a series of Irish Land Acts. William O'Brien played a leading role in the 1902 Land Conference to pave the way for the most advanced social legislation in Ireland since the Union, the Wyndham Land Purchase Act of 1903. This Act set the conditions for the break-up of large estates and gradually devolved to rural landholders, and tenants' ownership of the lands. It effectively ended the era of the absentee landlord, finally resolving the Irish Land Question.\nIn the 1870s the issue of Irish self-government again became a major focus of debate under Charles Stewart Parnell, founder of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Prime Minister Gladstone made two unsuccessful attempts to pass Home Rule in 1886 and 1893. Parnell's leadership ended when he was implicated in a divorce scandal that gained international publicity in 1890. He had been secretly living for years with Katherine O'Shea, the long-separated wife of a fellow Irish MP. Disaster came quickly: Gladstone and the Liberal Party refused to cooperate with him; his party split; the Irish Catholic bishops led the successful effort to crush his minority faction at by-elections. Parnell fought for control to the end, but his body was collapsing and he died in 1891 at age 45.\nAfter the introduction of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which broke the power of the landlord-dominated \"Grand Juries\", passing for the first time democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils, the debate over full Home Rule led to tensions between Irish nationalists and Irish unionists (those who favoured maintenance of the Union). Most of the island was predominantly nationalist, Catholic and agrarian. The northeast, however, was predominantly unionist, Protestant and industrialised. Unionists feared a loss of political power and economic wealth in a predominantly rural, nationalist, Catholic home-rule state. Nationalists believed they would remain economically and politically second-class citizens without self-government. Out of this division, two opposing sectarian movements evolved, the Protestant Orange Order and the Catholic Ancient Order of Hibernians.\nHome Rule became certain when in 1910 the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) under John Redmond held the balance of power in Commons and the third Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1912. Unionist resistance was immediate with the formation of the Ulster Volunteers. In turn the Irish Volunteers were established to oppose them and enforce the introduction of self-government.\nIn September 1914, just as the First World War broke out, the UK Parliament passed the Third Home Rule Act to establish self-government for Ireland, but was suspended for the duration of the war. To ensure implementation of Home Rule after the war, nationalist leaders and the IPP under Redmond supported with Ireland's participation in the British and Allied war effort under the Triple Entente against the expansion of Central Powers. The core of the Irish Volunteers were against this decision, but the majority left to form the National Volunteers who enlisted in Irish regiments of the New British Army, the 10th and 16th (Irish) Divisions, their Northern counterparts in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Before the war ended, Britain made two concerted efforts to implement Home Rule, one in May 1916 and again with the Irish Convention during 1917\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1918, but the Irish sides (Nationalist, Unionist) were unable to agree to terms for the temporary or permanent exclusion of Ulster from its provisions.\nThe period 1916\u20131921 was marked by political violence and upheaval, ending in the partition of Ireland and independence for 26 of its 32 counties. A failed militant attempt was made to gain separate independence for Ireland with the 1916 Easter Rising, an insurrection in Dublin. Though support for the insurgents was small, the violence used in its suppression led to a swing in support of the rebels. In addition, the unprecedented threat of Irishmen being conscripted to the British Army in 1918 (for service on the Western Front as a result of the German Spring Offensive) accelerated this change. (See: Conscription Crisis of 1918). In the December 1918 elections Sinn F\u00e9in, the party of the rebels, won three-quarters of all seats in Ireland, twenty-seven MPs of which assembled in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form a 32-county Irish Republic Parliament, the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann unilaterally declaring sovereignty over the entire island.\nUnwilling to negotiate any understanding with Britain short of complete independence, the Irish Republican Army, the army of the newly declared Irish Republic, waged a guerilla war (the Irish War of Independence) from 1919 to 1921. In the course of the fighting and amid much acrimony, the Fourth Government of Ireland Act 1920 implemented Home Rule while separating the island into what the British government's Act termed \"Northern Ireland\" and \"Southern Ireland\". In July 1921 the Irish and British governments agreed to a truce that halted the war. In December 1921 representatives of both governments signed an Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Irish delegation was led by Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins. This abolished the Irish Republic and created the Irish Free State, a self-governing Dominion of the Commonwealth of Nations in the manner of Canada and Australia. Under the Treaty, Northern Ireland could opt out of the Free State and stay within the United Kingdom: it promptly did so. In 1922 both parliaments ratified the Treaty, formalising independence for the 26-county Irish Free State (which renamed itself Ireland in 1937, and declared itself a republic in 1949); while the 6-county Northern Ireland, gaining Home Rule for itself, remained part of the United Kingdom. For most of the next 75 years, each territory was strongly aligned to either Catholic or Protestant ideologies, although this was more marked in the six counties of Northern Ireland.\nThe treaty to sever the Union divided the republican movement into anti-Treaty (who wanted to fight on until an Irish Republic was achieved) and pro-Treaty supporters (who accepted the Free State as a first step towards full independence and unity). Between 1922 and 1923 both sides fought the bloody Irish Civil War. The new Irish Free State government defeated the anti-Treaty remnant of the Irish Republican Army, imposing multiple executions. This division among nationalists still colours Irish politics today, specifically between the two leading Irish political parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael.\nThe new Irish Free State (1922\u201337) existed against the backdrop of the growth of dictatorships in mainland Europe and a major world economic downturn in 1929. In contrast with many contemporary European states it remained a democracy. Testament to this came when the losing faction in the Irish civil war, \u00c9amon de Valera's Fianna F\u00e1il, was able to take power peacefully by winning the 1932 general election. Nevertheless, until the mid-1930s, considerable parts of Irish society saw the Free State through the prism of the civil war, as a repressive, British-imposed state. It was only the peaceful change of government in 1932 that signalled the final acceptance of the Free State on their part. In contrast to many other states in the period, the Free State remained financially solvent as a result of low government expenditure, despite the Economic War with Britain. However, unemployment and emigration were high. The population declined to a low of 2.7 million recorded in the 1961 census.\nThe Roman Catholic Church had a powerful influence over the Irish state for much of its history. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, forbidding, for example, divorce, contraception, abortion, pornography as well as encouraging the censoring and banning of many books and films. In addition the Church largely controlled the State's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.[36] By the 1960s the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as Ne Temere, whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics. From 1945, the emigration rate of Protestants fell and they became less likely to emigrate than Catholics.[citation needed]\nIn 1937 a new Constitution re-established the state as Ireland (or \u00c9ire in Irish). The state remained neutral throughout World War II (see Irish neutrality), which saved it from much of the horrors of the war, although tens of thousands volunteered to serve in the British forces. Ireland was also impacted by food rationing, and coal shortages; peat production became a priority during this time. Though nominally neutral, recent studies have suggested a far greater level of involvement by the South with the Allies than was realised, with D Day's date set on the basis of secret weather information on Atlantic storms supplied by Ireland. For more detail on 1939\u201345, see main article The Emergency.\nIn 1949 the state was formally declared a republic and it left the British Commonwealth.\nIn the 1960s, Ireland underwent a major economic change under reforming Taoiseach (prime minister) Se\u00e1n Lemass and Secretary of the Department of Finance T.K. Whitaker, who produced a series of economic plans. Free second-level education was introduced by Donogh O'Malley as Minister for Education in 1968. From the early 1960s, Ireland sought admission to the European Economic Community but, because 90% of exports were to the United Kingdom market, it did not do so until the UK did, in 1973.\nGlobal economic problems in the 1970s, augmented by a set of misjudged economic policies followed by governments, including that of Taoiseach Jack Lynch, caused the Irish economy to stagnate. The Troubles in Northern Ireland discouraged foreign investment. Devaluation was enabled when the Irish Pound, or Punt, was established as a separate currency in 1979, breaking the link with the UK's sterling. However, economic reforms in the late 1980s, helped by investment from the European Community, led to the emergence of one of the world's highest economic growth rates, with mass immigration (particularly of people from Asia and Eastern Europe) as a feature of the late 1990s. This period came to be known as the Celtic Tiger and was focused on as a model for economic development in the former Eastern Bloc states, which entered the European Union in the early 2000s (decade). Property values had risen by a factor of between four and ten between 1993 and 2006, in part fuelling the boom.\nIrish society adopted relatively liberal social policies during this period. Divorce was legalised, homosexuality decriminalised, and abortion in limited cases was allowed by the Irish Supreme Court in the X Case legal judgement. Major scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, both sexual and financial, coincided with a widespread decline in religious practice, with weekly attendance at Roman Catholic Mass dropping by half in twenty years. A series of tribunals set up from the 1990s have investigated alleged malpractices by politicians, the Catholic clergy, judges, hospitals and the Garda\u00c3\u00ad (police).\nIreland's new found prosperity ended abruptly in 2008 when the banking system collapsed due to the Irish property bubble bursting. Some 25-26% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Irish banks and force banking sector consolidation. This was the largest banking bailout for any country in history, in comparison only 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Finnish banks in its banking crisis in the 1990s. This resulted in a major financial and political crisis as Ireland entered a recession.[37] Emigration rose to 1989 levels as the unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in 2007 to reach 14.6% as of February 2012.[38]\nHowever, since 2014, Ireland has seen strong economic growth, dubbed as the \"Celtic Phoenix\".\nThe 1920 Government of Ireland Bill created the state of Northern Ireland, which consisted of the six northeastern counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Antrim, Down and Armagh.[39] From 1921 to 1972, Northern Ireland was governed by a Unionist government, based at Stormont in east Belfast. Unionist leader and first Prime Minister, James Craig, declared that it would be \"a Protestant State for a Protestant People\". Craig's goal was to form and preserve Protestant authority in the new state which was above all an effort to secure a unionist majority. In 1926 the majority of the population in the province were Presbyterian and Anglican therefore solidifying Craig's Protestant political power. The Ulster Unionist Party thereafter formed every government until 1972.[40] Discrimination against the minority nationalist community in jobs and housing, and their total exclusion from political power due to the majoritarian electoral system, led to the emergence of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in the late 1960s, inspired by Martin Luther King's civil rights movement in the United States of America. The military forces of the Northern Protestants and Northern Catholics (IRA) turned to brutal acts of violence to establish power. As time went on it became clear that these two rival states would bring about a civil war. After the Second World War, keeping the cohesion within Stormont seemed impossible; increased economic pressures, solidified Catholic unity, and British involvement ultimately led to Stormont's collapse. As the civil rights movement of the United States gained worldwide acknowledgement, Catholics rallied together to achieve a similar socio-political recognition. This resulted in the formation of various organisations such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967 and the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) in 1964.[41] Non-violent protest became an increasingly important factor in mobilising Catholic sympathies and opinion and thus more effective in generating support than actively violent groups such as the IRA. However, these non-violent protests posed a problem to Northern Ireland's prime minister Terrance O'Neil (1963) because it hampered his efforts to persuade Catholics in Northern Ireland that they too, like their Protestant counterparts, belong within the United Kingdom. Despite O'Neil's reforming efforts there was growing discontent amongst both Catholics and Unionists. In October 1968 a peaceful civil rights march in Derry turned violent as police brutally beat protesters. The outbreak was televised by international media, and as a result the march was highly publicised which further confirmed the socio-political turmoil in Ireland.[42] A violent counter-reaction from conservative unionists led to civil disorder, notably the Battle of the Bogside and the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969. To restore order, British troops were deployed to the streets of Northern Ireland at that time.\nThe violent outbreaks in the late 1960s encouraged and helped strengthen military groups such as the IRA, who posited themselves as the protectors of the working class Catholics who were vulnerable to police and civilian brutality. During the late sixties and early seventies recruitment into the IRA organisation dramatically increased as street and civilian violence worsened. The interjection from the British troops proved to be insufficient to quell the violence and thus solidified the IRA's growing military importance.[43] On 30 January 1972 the worst tensions came to a head with the events of Bloody Sunday. Paratroops opened fire on civil rights protesters in Derry, killing 13 unarmed civilians. Bloody Friday, Bloody Sunday, and other violent acts in the early 1970s came to be known as the Troubles. The Stormont parliament was prorogued in 1972 and abolished in 1973. Paramilitary private armies such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army, resulted from a split within the IRA, the Official IRA and Irish National Liberation Army fought against the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Ulster Volunteer Force. Moreover, the British army and the (largely Protestant) Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) also took part in the chaos that resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 men, women and children, civilians and military. Most of the violence took place in Northern Ireland, but some also spread to England and across the Irish border.\nFor the next 27\u00c2\u00bd years, with the exception of five months in 1974, Northern Ireland was under \"direct rule\" with a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the British Cabinet responsible for the departments of the Northern Ireland government. Direct Rule was designed to be a temporary solution until Northern Ireland was capable of governing itself again. Principal acts were passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the same way as for much of the rest of the UK, but many smaller measures were dealt with by Order in Council with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. Attempts were made to establish a power-sharing executive, representing both the nationalist and unionist communities, by the Northern Ireland Constitution Act of 1973 and the Sunningdale Agreement in December 1973. Both acts however did little to create cohesion between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Constitution Act of 1973 formalised the UK government's affirmation of reunification of Ireland by consent only; therefore ultimately delegating the authoritative power of the border question from Stormont to the people of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland). Conversely, the Sunningdale Agreement included a \"provision of a Council of Ireland which held the right to execute executive and harmonizing functions\". Most significantly, the Sunningdale Agreement brought together political leaders from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the UK to deliberate for the first time since 1925.[44] The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention and Jim Prior's 1982 assembly were also temporarily implemented; however all failed to either reach consensus or operate in the longer term.\nDuring the 1970s British policy concentrated on defeating the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) by military means including the policy of Ulsterisation (requiring the RUC and British Army reserve Ulster Defence Regiment to be at the forefront of combating the IRA). Although IRA violence decreased it was obvious that no military victory was on hand in either the short or medium terms. Even Catholics who generally rejected the IRA were unwilling to offer support to a state that seemed to remain mired in sectarian discrimination, and the Unionists were not interested in Catholic participation in running the state in any case. In the 1980s the IRA attempted to secure a decisive military victory based on massive arms shipments from Libya. When this failed, senior republican figures began to look to broaden the struggle from purely military means. In time this began a move towards military cessation. In 1986 the Irish and British governments signed the Anglo Irish Agreement signalling a formal partnership in seeking a political solution. The Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) recognised the Irish government's right to be consulted and heard as well as guaranteed equality of treatment and recognition of the Irish and British identities of the two communities. The agreement also stated that the two governments must implement a cross-border co-operation.[45] Socially and economically Northern Ireland suffered the worst levels of unemployment in the UK and although high levels of public spending ensured a slow modernisation of public services and moves towards equality, progress was slow in the 1970s and 1980s. Only in the 1990s, when progress toward peace became tangible, did the economic situation brighten. By then the demographics of Northern Ireland had undergone significant change, and more than 40% of the population was Catholic.\nMore recently, the Belfast Agreement (\"Good Friday Agreement\") of 10 April 1998 brought \u2013 on 2 December 1999 \u2013 a degree of power sharing to Northern Ireland, giving both unionists and nationalists control of limited areas of government. However, both the power-sharing Executive and the elected Assembly were suspended between January and May 2000, and from October 2002 until April 2007, following breakdowns in trust between the political parties involving outstanding issues, including \"decommissioning\" of paramilitary weapons, policing reform and the removal of British army bases. In new elections in 2003, the moderate Ulster Unionist and (nationalist) Social Democrat and Labour parties lost their dominant positions to the more hard-line Democratic Unionist and (nationalist) Sinn F\u00e9in parties. On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and on 25 September 2005 international weapons inspectors supervised the full disarmament of the PIRA. Eventually, devolution was restored in April 2007.\nIreland's economy became more diverse and sophisticated than ever before by integrating itself into the global economy. By the beginning of the 1990s Ireland had transformed itself into a modern industrial economy and generated substantial national income that benefited the entire nation. Although dependence on agriculture still remained high, Ireland's industrial economy produced sophisticated goods that rivalled international competition. Ireland's international economic boom of the 1990s led to its being called a Celtic Tiger.\nThe Catholic Church, which once exercised great power, found its influence on socio-political issues in Ireland much reduced. Irish bishops were no longer able to advise and influence the public on how to exercise their political rights. Modern Ireland's detachment of the Church from ordinary life can be explained by the increasing disinterest in Church doctrine by younger generations and the questionable morality of the Church's representatives. A highly publicised case was that of Eamonn Casey, the Bishop of Galway, who resigned abruptly in 1992 after it was revealed that he had had an affair with an American woman and had fathered a child. Further controversies and scandals arose concerning paedophile and child-abusing priests. As a result, many in the Irish public began to question the credibility and effectiveness of the Catholic Church.[46] In 2011 Ireland closed its embassy at the Vatican, an apparent result of this growing trend.[47]\nThe national flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange. This flag, which bears the colours green for Roman Catholics, orange for Protestants, and white for the desired peace between them, dates to the mid-19th century.[48]\nThe tricolour was first unfurled in public by Young Irelander Thomas Francis Meagher who, using the symbolism of the flag, explained his vision as follows: \"The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the \"Orange\" and the \"Green,\" and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood\". Fellow nationalist John Mitchel said of it: \"I hope to see that flag one day waving as our national banner.\"\nAfter its use in the 1916 Rising it became widely accepted by nationalists as the national flag, and was used officially by the Irish Republic (1919\u201321) and the Irish Free State (1922\u201337).\nIn 1937 when the Constitution of Ireland was introduced, the tricolour was formally confirmed as the national flag: \"The national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange.\" While the tricolour today is the official flag of Ireland, it is not an official flag in Northern Ireland although it is sometimes used unofficially.\nThe only official flag representing Northern Ireland is the Union Flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland however its use is controversial.[49] The Ulster Banner is sometimes used unofficially as a de facto regional flag for Northern Ireland.\nSince Partition, there has been no universally-accepted flag to represent the entire island. As a provisional solution for certain sports fixtures, the Flag of the Four Provinces enjoys a certain amount of general acceptance and popularity.\nHistorically a number of flags have been used, including:\nSt Patrick's Saltire was formerly used to represent the island of Ireland by the all-island Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), before adoption of the four-provinces flag. The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) uses the tricolour to represent the whole island.\nIreland has a very large historiography, contributed by scholars in Ireland. North America and Britain.[50] There has been both a standard interpretation and, since the late 1930s, a good deal of revisionism.[51] One of the most important themes has always been Irish nationalism\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat Alfred Markey, calls:\nNationalism has led to numerous monographs and debates.[53][54]\nA great deal of attention has focused on the Irish revolutionary period, 1912-23. Starting in 2012 a series of conferences on \"Reflecting on a decade of War and Revolution in Ireland 1912-1923: Historians and Public History\" brought together hundreds of academics, teachers, and the general public.[55]\nIreland in some ways was the first acquisition of the British Empire.[56] Marshall says historians continue to debate whether Ireland should be considered part of the British Empire.[57] Recent work by historians pays special attention to continuing Imperial aspects of Irish history,[58] Atlantic Ocean history,[59] and the role of migration in forming the Irish diaspora across the Empire and North America.[60][61][62]\nAs historiography evolves, new approaches have been applied to the Irish situation. Studies of women, and gender relationships more generally, had been rare before 1990; they now are commonplace with over 3000 books and articles.[63] Postcolonialism is an approach in several academic disciplines that seeks to analyze, explain, and respond to the cultural legacies of colonialism and imperialism. The emphasis is usually on the human consequences of controlling a country and establishing settlers for the economic exploitation of the native people and their land.[64][65][66]",

        "text": "The Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy,[1] based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\"[2][3] She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.[4]\nFaustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers.[2] Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.[4]\nAs a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads.[5] The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips,[2] and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.[6][7]\nOn September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476).[8][9] Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus.[9]\nAccording to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others.[6][10][11] Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\"....When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying not as the just judge but as the Merciful Savior.\"\nFaustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity.[11] After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.[12]\nAccording to Roman Catholic tradition, the chaplet may be said at any time, but it is said especially on Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3:00 PM. The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong the \"3 o'clock Prayer\" is broadcast on radio and television stations daily at 3:00 p.m. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\nPope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Holy Wounds, these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.[13]\nThe Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\nThis prayer is optional, and may be used to begin the Chaplet:\nYou expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.[14]\nThis prayer, repeated three times in succession, is also optional, and may be used along with the first opening prayer to begin the Chaplet:\nO Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You![14]\nThis prayer opens each decade of the Chaplet:\nEternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.[14]\nThis prayer, repeated 10 times in succession, forms the body of each decade of the Chaplet:\nFor the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\nThis prayer, repeated three times in succession, concludes the Chaplet:\nHoly God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.[14]\nThis prayer is optional, and may be used after the Holy God to end the Chaplet:\nEternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.[14]\nThe chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary.[14][11] The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:[14][11]\nThe Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads:\nThe praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\nTo conclude:\nThe chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter.[15] The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray for the people who are lukewarm and indifferent.[16] Jesus described those people as follows:\nThese souls cause Me more suffering than any others; it was from such souls that My soul felt the most revulsion in the Garden of Olives. It was on their account that I said: \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass Me by.\" The last hope of salvation for them is to flee to My Mercy.\"[16]\nThe novena intentions for each day are:",

        "text": "MSNBC is an American news cable and satellite television network that provides news coverage and political commentary from NBC News on current events. MSNBC is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of the NBCUniversal Television Group division of NBCUniversal (all of which are ultimately owned by Comcast). MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit, hence the network's naming.[3] Although they had the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington while MSNBC operated out of NBC's headquarters in New York City. Microsoft divested its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com, and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.[4]\nIn the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network. MSNBC sought to sharpen its news image by entering into a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News. MSNBC Live, the network's flagship daytime news platform, was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day.[5]\nPhil Griffin is the president and director of day-to-day operations at MSNBC.[6] Pat Burkey, Janelle Rodriguez, and Jonathan Wald oversee programming and news operations, with Brian Williams serving as the channel's chief anchor of breaking news coverage.[7] As of February 2015, approximately 94,531,000 households in the United States (81.2 percent of those with television) were receiving MSNBC.[8]\nCommentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. In November 2007, a New York Times article stated that MSNBC's prime-time lineup is tilting more to the left. Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz has stated that the channel's evening lineup \"has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News\". In 2011, Salon.com noted that \"MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime-time lineup is now awash in progressive politics.\"\nMSNBC was established under a strategic partnership between NBC and Microsoft. NBC executive Tom Rogers was instrumental in developing this partnership. Microsoft invested $221 million for a 50 percent share of the cable channel.[9] MSNBC and Microsoft shared the cost of a $200 million newsroom in Secaucus, New Jersey, for msnbc.com. The network took over the channel space of NBC's 2-year-old America's Talking (AT) network, although in most cases cable carriage had to be negotiated with providers who had never carried AT.\nMSNBC was launched on July 15, 1996. The first show was anchored by Jodi Applegate and included news, interviews, and commentary.[10] During the day, rolling news coverage continued with The Contributors, a show that featured Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham, as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate, John Gibson, and John Seigenthaler. Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories CNN was running. NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories directly from NBC's network affiliates, along with breaking news coverage from the same sources.[11]\nMSNBC gradually increased its emphasis on politics.[12] After completing its seven-year survey of cable channels, the Project for Excellence in Journalism said in 2007 that, \"MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand, with a large dose of opinion and personality.\"[13]\nIn January 2001, Mike Barnicle's MSNBC show started, but it was canceled in June 2001 because of high production costs.[14] In June, Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer said that he would not have started MSNBC had he foreseen the difficulty of attracting viewers.[15]\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, NBC used MSNBC as an outlet for the up-to-the-minute coverage being provided by NBC News as a supplement to the longer stories on broadcast NBC. With little financial news to cover, CNBC and CNBC Europe ran MSNBC for many hours each day following the attacks. The year also boosted the profile of Ashleigh Banfield, who was present during the collapse of Building 7 while covering the World Trade Center on September 11.[16] Her Region In Conflict program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from Afghanistan.[17]\nIn the aftermath of September 11, MSNBC began calling itself \"America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NewsChannel\" and hired opinionated hosts like Alan Keyes, Phil Donahue, Pat Buchanan, and Tucker Carlson;[18] This branding makeover, however, was followed by declining ratings.[19]\nOn December 23, 2005, NBC Universal announced its acquisition of an additional 32 percent share of MSNBC from Microsoft,[20] which solidified its control over television operations and allowed NBC to further consolidate MSNBC's backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties. (The news website msnbc.com remained a separate joint venture between Microsoft and NBC for another seven years.) NBC later exercised its option to purchase Microsoft's remaining 18 percent interest in MSNBC.\nIn late 2005, MSNBC began attracting liberal and progressive viewers as Keith Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators during his Countdown With Keith Olbermann program. He especially focused his attention on the Fox News Channel and Bill O'Reilly, its principal primetime commentator.\nOn June 7, 2006, Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC after holding the post for two years.[21] Five days later, Dan Abrams, a nine-year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News, was named general manager of MSNBC with immediate effect. NBC News senior vice president Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC, while continuing to oversee NBC News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Today program, with Abrams reporting to Griffin.\nOn June 29, 2006, Abrams announced the revamp of MSNBC's early-primetime and primetime schedule. On July 10, Tucker (formerly The Situation with Tucker Carlson) started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET (taking over Abrams' old timeslot), while Rita Cosby's Live & Direct was canceled. Cosby was made the primary anchor for MSNBC Investigates at 10 and 11 p.m. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson's timeslots. According to the press release, MSNBC Investigates promised to \"complement MSNBC's existing programming by building on [the channel's] library of award winning documentaries.\"[22] The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. probably resulted from MSNBC's successful Friday \"experiment\" of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials.\nOn September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he was leaving his general manager position so he could focus on his 9:00 p.m. ET talk show, Live With Dan Abrams. Oversight of MSNBC was shifted to Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC.[23]\nMSNBC and NBC News began broadcasting from their new studios at NBC's 30 Rockefeller Center complex in New York City on October 22, 2007.[24] The extensive renovations of the associated studios allowed NBC to merge its entire news operation into one building. All MSNBC broadcasts and NBC Nightly News originate from the new studios. More than 12.5 hours of live television across the NBC News family originate from the New York studios daily. MSNBC is also announced new studios near the Universal Studios lot. MSNBC's master control did not make the move to 30 Rock. It remained in the old Secaucus headquarters until it completed its move to the NBC Universal Network Origination Center located inside the CNBC Global Headquarters building in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, on December 21, 2007. Shortly thereafter, Major League Baseball firmed up a long-term lease of the former MSNBC building to become the home studios of MLB Network, which launched from the facility on January 1, 2009.[citation needed]\nFrom mid-2007 to mid-2008, MSNBC enjoyed a large increase in its Nielsen ratings.[25] Primetime viewings increased by 61 percent.[25] In May 2008, NBC News president Steve Capus said, \"It used to be people didn't have to worry about MSNBC because it was an also-ran cable channel.... That's not the case anymore.\"[25] Tim Russert's sudden death in June 2008 removed what The Wall Street Journal called the \"rudder for the network\" and led to a period of transition.[26]\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, MSNBC's coverage was anchored by Olbermann, Chris Matthews, and David Gregory. They were widely viewed as the face of the channel's political coverage.[26] During the first three months of the presidential campaign, MSNBC's ratings grew by 158 percent.[27] Olbermann and Matthews, however, were criticized for expressing left-leaning opinions on the channel. Both were later removed from their anchor positions.[28] Audience viewership during the 2008 presidential campaign more than doubled from the 2004 presidential election, and the channel topped CNN in ratings for the first time during the last three months of the campaign in the key 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c54 age demographic.[29][30]\nIn September 2008, the channel hired political analyst and Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow to host a new political opinion program called The Rachel Maddow Show. The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a smart ratings move, where beforehand, MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings.[31] The show regularly outperformed CNN's Larry King Live, and made the channel competitive in the program's time slot for the first time in over a decade.[32][33]\nIn the first quarter of 2010, MSNBC beat CNN in primetime and overall ratings, marking the first time doing so since 2001.[34] The channel also beat CNN in total adult viewers in March, marking the seventh out of the past eight months that MSNBC achieved that result.[34] In addition, the programs Morning Joe, The Ed Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and The Rachel Maddow Show finished ahead of their time slot competitors at CNN.[34][35]\nIn the third quarter of 2010, MSNBC continued its solid lead over CNN, beating the network in total day for the first time since the second quarter of 2001 in the key adult demographic.[36] The network also beat CNN for the fourth consecutive quarter, among both primetime and total viewers, as well as becoming the only cable news network to have its key adult demographic viewership grow over the last quarter, increasing by 4 percent. During this time, MSNBC also became the number-one cable news network in primetime among both African American and Hispanic viewers.[36]\nOn October 11, 2010, MSNBC unveiled a new televised advertising campaign and slogan called \"Lean Forward\". \"We've taken on CNN and we beat them,\" MSNBC president Phil Griffin told employees at a series of celebratory \"town hall\" meetings. \"Now it's time to take on Fox.\" Concerning the campaign, Griffin said, \"It is active, it is positive, it is about making tomorrow better than today, a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time.\"[37] The new campaign embraces the network's politically progressive identity.[38] The two-year advertising campaign would cost $2 million and consist of internet, television, and print advertising.[37] The new positioning has created brand image issues for msnbc.com, the umbrella website for the television network. A New York Times article quotes Charlie Tillinghast, president of msnbc.com, a separate company, as saying, \"Both strategies are fine, but naming them the same thing is brand insanity.\"[39] As a result, msnbc.com eventually changed its name to prevent confusion with the television network, MSNBC;[39] it rebranded the more news-driven msnbc.com as NBCNews.com in July 2012.[40]\nOn January 21, 2011, Olbermann announced his departure from MSNBC and the episode would be the final episode of Countdown.[41][42] His departure received much media attention.[43][44][45] MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract with Olbermann, with no further explanation. Olbermann later revealed that he had taken his show to Current TV.[46]\nDuring 2014, MSNBC's total ratings in the 25 to 54 age group declined 20 percent, falling to third place behind CNN. The only demographic in which MSNBC still led was among Hispanics and even more so among African-Americans.[47][clarification needed]\nTo help revive the struggling network, MSNBC in the summer of 2015 started transitioning from left-leaning, opinionated programming to hard news programming. Nearly all daytime opinionated news programs were replaced with more generic news programs. Ronan Farrow, Joy-Ann Reid, Krystal Ball, Tour\u00e9, Abby Huntsman, Alex Wagner, Ed Schultz, and Al Sharpton lost their shows. News programs presented by established NBC News personalities such as Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart, Meet the Press anchor Chuck Todd, Sunday NBC Nightly News anchor Kate Snow, Thomas Roberts, and former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams replaced the opinion shows.[48] The revamped on-air presentation debuted in late summer 2015 and included a new logo, news ticker, and graphics package.[49][50] MSNBC Live had at least eight hours of programming each day, barring any breaking news that could extend its time. Daytime news coverage was led primarily by Brian Williams, Stephanie Ruhle, Jose Diaz-Balart, Andrea Mitchell, Craig Melvin, Thomas Roberts, and Kate Snow, in addition to \"beat leaders\" stationed throughout the newsroom. These included chief legal correspondent Ari Melber, primary political reporter Steve Kornacki, business and finance correspondent Olivia Sterns, and senior editor Cal Perry. Morning and primetime programming did not change and remained filled mostly by opinionated personalities.[51][52]\nIn April 2016, MSNBC launched a promotional ad campaign with the theme, \"in order to know beyond, you have to go beyond.\" The campaign portrayed MSNBC's reporting and perspectives as \"in depth\" and an alternative to \"talking points\" coverage on other cable news outlets.[53]\nIn July 2016, the network debuted Dateline Extra, which was an abridged version of Dateline NBC and another step towards aligning MSNBC and NBC News. The new program was hosted by MSNBC Live anchor Tamron Hall.[54]\nIn September 2016, MSNBC launched The 11th Hour with Brian Williams as a nightly wrap-up of the day's news and a preview of the following day's headlines. This was MSNBC's first new primetime program in nearly four years.[55]\nIn January 2017, MSNBC debuted a program in the 6 pm EST hour entitled For the Record with Greta, hosted by former Fox News Channel anchor Greta Van Susteren.[56] The program aired for six months before being cancelled in late June 2017. The network promoted Chief legal Correspondent Ari Melber to host The Beat with Ari Melber at 6pm.\nIn March 2017, MSNBC started rebranding their daytime shows as \"NBC News\" programs. The network logos started appearing on show opens, within the set design, and in commercials.[57] In May 2017, MSNBC launched a 4pm afternoon program entitled Deadline: White House and hosted by former White House communications director and NBC political analyst Nicolle Wallace.\nFor the first time, MSNBC in May 2017 became the highest rated American cable news network in primetime. MSNBC's increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at the Fox News Channel. MSNBC's May 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c19 programming topped the programming of both CNN and the Fox News Channel in total viewers and the advertiser-coveted younger demographic.[58]\nAnother significant change was made in April 16, 2018, when MSNBC completely removed the news ticker at the bottom of the screen on every program, citing the reason \"for a cleaner view that puts our reporting more front and center ... and we want viewers to get the best possible experience\". At the time of the change, CNN is still running the news ticker during live programming (although its sister networks, CNN International and HLN do not), meanwhile FOX News only scraps the news ticker during daytime news programs.[59]\nBefore 2010, MSNBC was not available to Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-verse television subscribers in the portions of New York State, northern New Jersey, and Connecticut that overlapped Cablevision's service area. One of several reasons for this was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision that prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC.[60] The terms of the agreement were not publicly known.[citation needed]\nIn 2009, Verizon filed a formal \"program-access complaint\" with the Federal Communications Commission and petitioned for termination of the deal. In support of Verizon, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal argued that the arrangement could be illegal.[61] After entering into a new contract, FiOS added the channel in New York City and New Jersey on February 2, 2010.[62]\nMSNBC is shown only in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Kenya, parts of Latin America, parts of northern Africa, and most of the time in the Middle East.\nA Canadian version with some local content, MSNBC Canada, was launched on September 7, 2001. It was discontinued, however, in 2004. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission then authorized the American version to be carried on Canadian cable and satellite providers. The channel was operated by Rogers Communications and co-owned by Rogers, Shaw Communications, and MSNBC, with each party owning a 33.33 percent voting interest in the service.\nProgramming included MSNBC programs and, to fulfill its Canadian content responsibilities, repeats of shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Cable Public Affairs Channel. The channel also ran infomercials.[citation needed]\nIn southern Africa, MSNBC is distributed free-to-air on satellite on Free2View TV as MSNBC Africa, a joint venture between Great Media Limited and MSNBC. Free2View airs MSNBC's programming from 4 p.m. to midnight ET in a block that repeats twice (live for the first airing), with local Weather Channel forecasts.[63] Botswana's national television broadcaster, BTV, also provides an un-edited broadcast of MSNBC (including advertisements) after their scheduled programming each evening. BTV is available within Botswana, as well as to Southern Africa viewers on DStv. TopTV, a satellite TV service in South Africa, also provides an unedited broadcast of MSNBC (including advertisements), which runs 24 hours a day. It is also available in Kenya and Uganda through the Zuku cable service.[citation needed]\nMSNBC programming is shown for most of the day on the 24-hour news network OSN News.[citation needed]\nIn Asia and Europe, MSNBC is not shown on a dedicated channel. When MSNBC started in 1996, they announced plans to start broadcasting in Europe during 1997. This never happened. However MSNBC has been seen occasionally on affiliate channel CNBC Europe.[64] MSNBC was shown overnight at the weekend and during the afternoon on American public holidays as well as during breaking news events.[64] MSNBC stopped being shown on CNBC Europe in the late 2000s and coverage of non-business related breaking news now comes from CNBC U.S.'s own coverage or from NBC News.\nIn Turkey, NTV-MSNBC is the news channel of the Turkish broadcaster NTV Turkey. The channel is a joint partnership between the two, although very little Turkish content is shown on English MSNBC. English content on MSNBC is translated into Turkish.[65]\nMSNBC and its website msnbc.com were launched concurrently. Unlike the network, msnbc.com was operated as the general online news outlet of NBC News in partnership with Microsoft's MSN.com portal. The network and website also remained editorially separate. The website did not adopt the network's increasingly liberal viewpoints and remained a joint venture with Microsoft even after it had sold its stake in MSNBC.[66]\nIn July 2012, NBC acquired Microsoft's remaining stake in msnbc.com and re-branded it as NBCNews.com. After being redirected to the new name for a period, msnbc.com was re-launched in 2013 as the website for MSNBC. The website included opinion columns from hosts, correspondents, and guests, along with live and on-demand videos from MSNBC programs.[40][67]\nIn July 2014, msnbc.com launched msnbc2, a brand for several web-only series hosted by MSNBC personalities.[68] In December 2014, msnbc2 was renamed shift, with a programming schedule that was less focused on politics and more tailored to a younger audience.[69]\nMSNBC launched on XM Satellite Radio channel 120 and Sirius Satellite Radio channel 90 on April 12, 2010.[2] This is the second time MSNBC has been available on satellite radio. The channel was dropped from XM Radio on September 4, 2006.[70]\nThe simulcast of MSNBC's programming is on SiriusXM channel 118.[71]\nIn November 2007, a New York Times article stated that MSNBC's primetime lineup was tilting more to the left.[72] Since then, commentators have argued that MSNBC has a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. Washington Post media analyst and Fox News Channel contributor Howard Kurtz has claimed that the channel's evening lineup \"has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News.\"[25] In 2011, Politico referred to MSNBC as \"left-leaning,\"[73] and Steve Kornacki of Salon.com noted that, \"MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime-time lineup is now awash in progressive politics.\"[74] Regarding changes in the channel's evening programming, senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin claimed that \"it happened naturally. There isn't a dogma we're putting through. There is a 'Go for it.'\"[72]\nIn the February 2008 issue of Men's Journal magazine, an MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive as saying that liberal commentator Keith Olbermann \"runs MSNBC\" and that \"because of his success, he's in charge\" of the channel.[75] In 2007, The New York Times called Olbermann MSNBC's \"most recognizable face\".[72] In September 2008, MSNBC stated that Olbermann and Chris Matthews would no longer anchor live political events, with David Gregory assuming that role. MSNBC cited the growing criticism that they were \"too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign.\"[76][77] Olbermann's show Countdown continued to run before and after the presidential and vice presidential debates, and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel's election night coverage.[citation needed]\nOn November 13, 2009, in the days leading up to the release of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's book Going Rogue, MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan used photoshopped pictures of Palin on the channel's Morning Meeting program. Ratigan apologized a few days later.[78]\nIn October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline \"Lean Forward\". Some media outlets, including msnbc.com, claimed that the network was now embracing its politically progressive identity.[38][79][80][81]\nIn January 2012, MSNBC used Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews, and other network commentators during its coverage of the Iowa Republican caucuses. Nando Di Fino of the Mediaite website said MSNBC was \"giving up on the straight news coverage, and instead [appearing] to be aiming to create some controversy.\"[82]\nIn November 2012, The New York Times called MSNBC \"The Anti-Fox\" and quoted former President Bill Clinton as saying, \"Boy, it really has become our version of Fox.\"[83] Citing data from the A.C. Nielsen TV ratings service, the article noted that while the Fox News Channel had a larger overall viewership than MSNBC, the two networks were separated by only around 300,000 viewers among the 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c54 age bracket most attractive to advertisers.\nIn the Pew Research Center's 2013 \"State of the News Media\" report, MSNBC was found to be the most opinionated news network, with 85 percent of the content being commentary or opinions and the remaining 15 percent being factual reporting. The report also stated that in 2012, MSNBC spent only $240 million on news production compared to CNN's $682 million and the Fox News Channel's $820 million.[84]\nSome Democratic Party supporters, including former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell and Bill Clinton advisor Lanny Davis,[85] criticized MSNBC during and after the 2008 Democratic Party primaries as covering Barack Obama more favorably than Hillary Clinton. Rendell said, \"MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign,\" and called their coverage \"absolutely embarrassing\".[86][87] Rendell later became an on-air contributor to MSNBC.[88]\nA study done by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama (14 percent of stories versus 29 percent in the press overall) and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate John McCain (73 percent of its coverage versus 57 percent in the press overall).[89] MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, \"The Power of Change\", was criticized for being too similar to Obama's campaign slogan of \"Hope and Change\".[90] After the election, conservative talk show host John Ziegler made a documentary entitled Media Malpractice.... How Obama Got Elected, which was very critical of the media's role, especially MSNBC's, in the election. While promoting the documentary, he had an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor Contessa Brewer about how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed Sarah Palin.[91]\nDuring MSNBC's coverage of the Potomac primary, MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, \"I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often.\" This led Fox News to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.[92]\nIn June 2010, the MSNBC documentary Rise of the New Right aired. It featured interviews with right-wing figures, including Dick Armey, the former House majority Leader, Orly Taitz, a leading figure in the \"birther\" movement, and conspiracy theorist radio host Alex Jones. The documentary also showed the Michigan Militia's survival training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky senatorial candidate Rand Paul.[93]\nThe documentary angered Tea Party movement figures and others on the right. After the documentary aired, FreedomWorks, chaired by Armey, called for a boycott of Dawn and Procter & Gamble, which advertised during Hardball with Chris Matthews.[94][95] The boycott was ineffective as Procter & Gamble continued to advertise on the show.\nA study by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that MSNBC's coverage of Mitt Romney during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign (68 percent negative with no positive stories in the sample), was far more negative than the overall press, and even more negative than it had been during October 1 to 28, when 5 percent was positive and 57 percent was negative.[96] On the other hand, their coverage of Barack Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From October 1 to 28, 33 percent of stories were positive and 13 percent negative. During the campaign's final week, 51 percent of MSNBC's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about Obama in the sample.\nPolitical commentator Melissa Harris-Perry and her guest panel, in a look back on the 2013 segment of her show, featured a picture of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his extended family. Romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, Kieran Romney, an African-American. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian Dean Obeidallah, joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, \"One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the same.\" Obeidallah said, \"It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the [Republican National Committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person.\" Afterwards, Harris-Perry issued an apology in a series of tweets.[97][98]\nDuring the spring and early summer of 2003, MSNBC featured a weekend talk show hosted by conservative radio host Michael Savage. In July of that year, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a \"pig\" and a \"sodomite\", and telling him he \"should get AIDS and die.\" Savage's show was canceled and Savage was fired from the channel shortly afterward (with some reports placing the termination immediately after the episode in question ended).[99]\nIn early April 2007, Don Imus, whose radio show Imus in the Morning was simulcast on MSNBC for over ten years, described members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team as \"some nappy-headed hoes.\" The comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, MSNBC canceled the simulcast. Imus, as well as NBC News, apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks.[100] The television simulcast of Imus' program later moved to RFD-TV until August 2009 and then to Fox Business Network until May 2015.\nOn November 5, 2010, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Keith Olbermann indefinitely without pay for contributing $2,400 (the maximum personal donation limit) to each of three Democratic Party candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle.[101] NBC News policy prohibited contributions to political campaigns unless NBC News had given its prior permission. On November 7, 2010, Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter.[102] That same day, MSNBC announced that he would be back on the air starting on November 9.[103]\nTwo weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for the same offense, as the Morning Joe host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann's suspension, Scarborough's suspension was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24.[104] On January 21, 2011, MSNBC announced that Olbermann would host his final show that same night.\nHost Martin Bashir resigned after making a controversial comment about Sarah Palin.[105] On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Palin for equating the federal debt to slavery.[106] Bashir referred to the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves as described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood, specifically a punishment called \"Derby's dose\", which forced slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave. Bashir then said, \"When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.\"[107][108]\nAlec Baldwin's 2013 show Up Late with Alec Baldwin was suspended after five episodes because of a homophobic slur Baldwin made to a photographer in New York City.[109]\nPhil Donahue's 2002 program Donahue was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the Iraq War. Despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings,[110] Donahue was MSNBC's highest rated show that month.[111]\nA leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as \"a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.\"[111]",

        "text": "Blue, white[1][2]\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs (officially the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club) are a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The club is owned by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, Ltd. and are represented by Chairman Larry Tanenbaum. With an estimated worth of US $1.1 billion in 2016 according to Forbes, the Leafs are the third most valuable franchise in the NHL, after the Montreal Canadiens and the New York Rangers.[3] The team's broadcasting rights are split between BCE Inc. and Rogers Communication.[4] For their first 14 seasons, the club played their home games at the Mutual Street Arena, before moving to Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931. The club moved to their present home, the Air Canada Centre in February 1999.\nThe Maple Leafs were founded in 1917, operating simply as Toronto and known then as the Toronto Arenas. Under new ownership, the club was named the Toronto St. Patricks in 1919. In 1927 the club was purchased by Conn Smythe and renamed the Maple Leafs. A member of the \"Original Six,\" the club was one of six NHL teams to have endured through the period of League retrenchment during the Great Depression. The club has won thirteen Stanley Cup championships, second only to the 24 championships of the Montreal Canadiens. The club's history includes two recognized dynasties, from 1946 to 1951; and from 1961 to 1967.[5][6] Winning their last championship in 1967, the club's 50-season drought between championships is the longest current streak in the NHL.\nThe Maple Leafs have rivalries with three NHL franchises, the Detroit Red Wings, the Montreal Canadiens, and the Ottawa Senators. The club is affiliated with two minor league teams, the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League, and the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL.\nThe National Hockey League was formed in 1917 in Montreal by teams formerly belonging to the National Hockey Association (NHA) that had a dispute with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts. The owners of the other four clubs \u2014 the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Quebec Bulldogs and the Ottawa Senators \u2014 wanted to get rid of Livingstone, but discovered that the NHA constitution did not allow them to simply vote him out of the league.[7] Instead, they opted to create a new league, the NHL, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. They also remained voting members of the NHA, and thus had enough votes to suspend the other league's operations, effectively leaving Livingstone's squad in a one-team league.[8]\nThe NHL had decided that it would operate a four-team circuit, made up of the Canadiens, Maroons, Ottawa, and one more club in either Quebec or Toronto. Toronto's inclusion in the NHL's inaugural season was formally announced on November 26, 1917, with concerns over the Bulldog's financial stability surfacing.[9] The League granted temporary franchise rights to the Arena Company, owners of the Arena Gardens.[10] The NHL granted the Arena responsibility of the Toronto franchise for only for the inaugural season, with specific instructions to resolve the dispute with Livingstone, or transfer ownership of the Toronto franchise back to the League at the end of the season.[11] The roster was composed almost entirely of former Blueshirts, including Harry Cameron and Reg Noble, but the club does not claim their history. The franchise did not have an official name, but was informally called \"the Blueshirts\" or \"the Torontos\" by the fans and press.[12] During the inaugural season the club performed the first trade in NHL history, acquiring the Senators' spare goaltender, Sammy Hebert, in return for cash.[13] Under manager Charlie Querrie, and head coach Dick Carroll, the team won the Stanley Cup in the inaugural 1917\u201318 season.[14]\nFor the next season, rather than return the Blueshirts' players to Livingstone as originally promised, on October 19, 1918, the Arena Company requested to become a permanent franchise, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club, which was readily granted by the NHL.[15] The Arena Company also decided that year that only NHL teams were allowed to play at the Arena Gardens\u2014a move which effectively killed the NHA.[16] Livingstone sued to get his players back. Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced the Arenas to sell some of their stars, resulting in a horrendous five-win season in 1918\u201319. With the company facing increasing financial difficulties, and the Arenas officially eliminated from the playoffs, the NHL agreed to let the team forfeit their last two games.[13][2] Operations halted on February 20, 1919, with the NHL ending its season and starting the playoffs. The Arenas' .278 winning percentage that season is still the worst in franchise history. However, the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals ended without a winner due to the worldwide flu epidemic.[13]\nThe legal dispute forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy, and it was forced to sell the team. On December 9, 1919, Querrie brokered the team's purchase by the owners of the St. Patricks Hockey Club, allowing him to maintain an ownership stake in the team.[17] The new owners renamed the team the Toronto St. Patricks (or St. Pats for short), which operated until 1927.[18] Changing the colours of the team from blue to green, the club won their second Stanley Cup championship in 1922.[2] Babe Dye scored four times in the 5\u20131 Stanley Cup-clinching victory against the Vancouver Millionaires.[19] In 1924 Jack Bickell invested $25,000 in the St. Pats as a favour to his friend Querrie, who needed to financially reorganize his hockey team.[20]\nAfter a number of financially difficult seasons, the St. Patricks' ownership group seriously considered selling the team to C. C. Pyle for CAD$200,000. Pyle sought to move the team to Philadelphia.[2][21] However, Toronto Varsity Graduates' coach Conn Smythe put together a group of his own and made a $160,000 offer. With the support of St. Pats shareholder J. P. Bickell, Smythe persuaded Querrie to accept their bid, arguing that civic pride was more important than money.[21]\nAfter taking control on February 14, 1927, Smythe immediately renamed the team the Maple Leafs, after the national symbol of Canada.[22] He attributed his choice of a maple leaf for the logo to his experiences as a Canadian Army officer and prisoner of war during World War I. Viewing the maple leaf as a \"badge of courage,\" and a reminder of home, Smythe decided to give the same name to his hockey team, in honour of the many Canadian soldiers who wore it.[2][23][24] However, the team was not the first to use the name. A Toronto minor-league baseball team had used the name \"Maple Leafs\" since 1896.\nInitial reports were that the team's colours were to be red and white,[25] but the Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927.[26] On September 27, 1927, it was announced that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white.[27] Although Smythe later stated he chose blue because it represents the Canadian skies and white to represent snow, these colours were also used on his gravel and sand business' trucks.[27] The colour scheme also followed a longstanding tradition of top-level, Toronto-based teams using blue as their primary colour, starting with the Toronto Argonauts in 1873, the University of Toronto Varsity Blues in 1877, the Maple Leafs baseball team, as well as the NHA's Toronto Blueshirts.\nDespite four more lacklustre seasons (including three with Smythe as coach), Smythe saw the increasing popularity of the team, and the need for a new arena. Finding an adequate number of financiers, he purchased land from the Eaton family, and construction of the arena was completed in five months.[28][29] The Maple Leafs debuted at their new arena, Maple Leaf Gardens, with a 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 loss to the Chicago Black Hawks on November 12, 1931.[29] The debut also featured Foster Hewitt in his newly constructed 'gondola' above the ice surface, where he began his famous Hockey Night in Canada radio broadcasts that eventually came to be a Saturday-night tradition.[29]\nBy the 1931\u201332 NHL season, the Maple Leafs were led by the \"Kid Line\" consisting of Busher Jackson, Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher and coached by Dick Irvin. The Leafs captured their third Stanley Cup that season, vanquishing the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round, the Montreal Maroons in the semifinals, and the New York Rangers in the finals.[30] Smythe took particular pleasure in defeating the Rangers that year. He had been tapped as the Rangers' first general manager and coach for their inaugural season (1926\u201327), but had been fired in a dispute with Madison Square Garden management before the season had begun.[31]\nMaple Leafs' star forward Ace Bailey was nearly killed in 1933 when Boston Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore checked him from behind at full speed into the boards.[32] Leafs defenceman Red Horner knocked Shore out with a punch, but Bailey, writhing on the ice, had his career ended.[29] The Leafs held the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, the NHL's first All-Star Game, to collect medical funds to help Bailey. His jersey was retired later the same night.[33] The Leafs reached the finals five times in the next seven years, but bowed out to the now-defunct Maroons in 1935, the Detroit Red Wings in 1936, Chicago in 1938, Boston in 1939 as well as the Rangers in 1940.[29] After the end of the 1939\u201340 season, Smythe allowed Irvin to leave the team as head coach, replacing him with former Leafs captain Hap Day.[29]\nIn the 1942 season, the Maple Leafs were down three games to none in a best-of-seven series in the playoffs against Detroit. Fourth-line forward Don Metz then galvanized the team, coming from nowhere to score a hat-trick in game four and the game-winner in game five, with the Leafs winning both times.[34] Captain Syl Apps won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season, not taking one penalty, and finished his ten-season career with an average of 5 minutes, 36 seconds in penalties a season.[35] Goalie Turk Broda shut out the Wings in game six, and Sweeney Schriner scored two goals in the third period to win the seventh game 3\u20131, completing the reverse-sweep.[36] The Leafs remain the only team to have successfully performed a reverse-sweep in the Stanley Cup finals.[37]\nSmythe, who reenlisted in the Canadian Army at the outbreak of World War II, was given leave from military duty to view the final game of the 1942 finals. He arrived at the game in full military regalia.[36] Earlier, at the outbreak of war, Smythe arranged for many of his Maple Leafs players and staff to take army training with the Toronto Scottish Regiment. Most notably, the Leafs announced a large portion of their roster had enlisted, including Apps, and Broda,[38] who did not play on the team for several seasons due to their obligations with the Canadian Forces.[39] During this period, the Leafs turned to lesser-known players such as rookie goaltender Frank McCool and defenceman Babe Pratt.[39][40]\nThe Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in the 1945 Finals. They won the first three games, with goaltender McCool recording consecutive shutouts. However, in a reverse of the 1942 finals, the Red Wings won the next three games.[39] The Leafs were able to win the series, winning the seventh game in 2\u00c2\u00a0-1 to prevent a complete reversal of the series played three years ago.[39]\nAfter the end of the war, players who had enlisted were beginning to return to their teams.[39] With Apps and Broda regaining their form, the Maple Leafs beat the first-place Canadiens in the 1947 finals.[39] In an effort to bolster their centre depth, the Leafs acquired Cy Thomas and Max Bentley in the following the off-season. With these key additions, the Leafs were able to win a second consecutive Stanley Cup, sweeping the Red Wings in the 1948 finals.[39] With their victory in 1948, the Leafs moved ahead of Montreal as the team having won the most Stanley Cups in League history. It took the Canadiens ten years to reclaim the record. Apps announced his retirement following the 1948 finals, with Ted Kennedy replacing him as the team's captain.[41] Under a new captaincy, the Leafs managed to make it to the 1949 finals, facing the Red Wings, who had finished the season with the best overall record. However, the Leafs went on to win their third consecutive Cup, sweeping the Red Wings in four games. This brought the total of Detroit's play off game losses against the Leafs to eleven.[39] The Red Wings were able to end this losing streak in the following post-season, eliminating Toronto in the 1950 NHL playoffs.[39]\nThe Maple Leafs and Canadiens met again in the 1951 finals, with five consecutive overtime games played in the series.[42] Defenceman Bill Barilko managed to score the series-winning goal in overtime, leaving his defensive position (in spite of coach Joe Primeau's instructions not to) to pick up an errant pass and score.[42] Barilko helped the club secure its fourth Stanley Cup in five years. His glory was short-lived, as he disappeared in a plane crash near Timmins, Ontario, four months later.[42][43] The crash site was not found until a helicopter pilot discovered the plane's wreckage plane about 80 kilometres (50\u00c2\u00a0mi) north of Cochrane, Ontario eleven years later.[44] The Leafs did not win another Cup during the 1950s, with rumours swirling that the team was \"cursed,\" and would not win a cup until Barilko's body was found.[45] The \"curse\" came to an end after the Leafs' 1962 Stanley Cup victory, which came seven weeks before to the discovery of the wreckage of Barilko's plane.[45]\nTheir 1951 victory was followed by lacklustre performances in the following seasons. The team finished third in the 1951\u201352 season, and were eventually swept by the Red Wings in the semi-finals.[42] With the conclusion of the 1952\u201353 regular season, the Leafs failed to make it to the post-season for the first time since the 1945\u201346 playoffs.[42] The Leafs' poor performance may be attributed partly to a decline in their sponsored junior system (including the Toronto St. Michael's Majors and the Toronto Marlboros).[42] The junior system was managed by Frank J. Selke until his departure to the Canadiens in 1946. In his absence, the quality of players it produced declined. Many who were called up to the Leafs in the early 1950s were found to be seriously lacking in ability. It was only later in the decade that the Leafs' feeder clubs turned out enough impressive prospects to enable the team to be competitive again.[42]\nAfter a two-year drought from the playoffs, the Maple Leafs clinched a berth after the 1958\u201359 season. A relatively young team, under Punch Imlach, a new general manager and coach, the team managed to make it to the 1959 Finals, although they lost to the Canadiens in five games.[42] Building on a successful playoff run, the Leafs followed up with a second-place finish in the 1959\u201360 regular season. Although they advanced to their second straight Cup Finals, the Leafs were again defeated by the Canadiens in four games.[42]\nBeginning in the 1960s, the Leafs became a stronger team, with Johnny Bower as goaltender, and Bob Baun, Carl Brewer, Tim Horton and Allan Stanley serving as the Maple Leafs' defencemen.[46] In an effort to bolster their forward group during the 1960 off-season, Imlach traded Marc Reaume to the Red Wings for Red Kelly. Originally a defenceman, Kelly was asked to make the transition to the role of centre, where he remained for the rest of his career.[46] Kelly helped reinforce a forward group made up of Frank Mahovlich, and team captain George Armstrong. The beginning of the 1960\u201361 season also saw the debut of rookies Bob Nevin, and Dave Keon. Keon previously played for the St. Michael's Majors (the Maple Leafs junior affiliate), but had impressed Imlach during the Leafs' training camp, and joined the team for the season.[46] Despite these new additions, the Leafs' 1961 playoff run ended in the semifinals against the Red Wings, with Armstrong, Bower, Kelly and others, suffering from injuries.[46]\nIn November 1961, Smythe sold nearly all of his shares in the club's parent company, Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), to a partnership composed of his son Stafford Smythe, and his partners, newspaper baron John Bassett and Toronto Marlboros President Harold Ballard. The sale price was $2.3 million, a handsome return on Smythe's original investment 34 years earlier.[47] Initially, Conn Smythe claimed that he knew nothing about his son's partners and was furious with the arrangement. However, he did not stop the deal because of it.[48] Conn Smythe was given a retiring salary of $15,000 per year for life, an office, secretary, a car with a driver, and seats to home games.[49] Smythe sold his remaining shares in the company, and resigned from the board of directors in March 1966, after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. Smythe found Ali's refusal to serve in the United States Army offensive, noting that the Gardens was \"no place for those who want to evade conscription in their own country\".[50] He had also said that because the Gardens' owners agreed to host the fight they had \"put cash ahead of class\".[51]\nUnder the new ownership, Toronto won another three straight Stanley Cups. The team won the 1962 Stanley Cup Finals beating the defending champion Chicago Black Hawks on a goal from Dick Duff in Game 6.[52] During the 1962\u201363 season, the Leafs finished first in the league for the first time since the 1947\u201348 season. In the following playoffs, the team won their second Stanley Cup of the decade.[46] The 1963\u201364 season saw certain members of the team traded. With Imlach seeking to reinvigorate the slumping Leafs, he made a mid-season trade that sent Duff, and Nevin to the Rangers for Andy Bathgate and Don McKenney. The Leafs managed to make the post-season as well as the Cup finals. The 1964 Cup finals were perhaps most notable for Baun's heroic performance. During game six, Baun suffered a fractured ankle and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice. Surprisingly, he returned to play with his ankle frozen, and eventually scored the overtime, game-winning goal against the Red Wings.[53][46] Winning game seven 4\u20130, with two goals from Bathgate, the Leafs won their third consecutive Stanley Cup.[46]\nThe two seasons after the Maple Leafs' Stanley Cup victories, the team saw several player departures, including Bathgate, and Brewer, as well as several new additions, including Marcel Pronovost, and Terry Sawchuk.[46] During the 1966\u201367, the team had lost 10 games in a row, sending Imlach to the hospital with a stress-related illness. However, from the time King Clancy took over as the head coach, to Imlach's return, the club was on a 10-game undefeated streak, building momentum before the playoffs.[46] The Leafs made their last Cup finals in 1967. Playing against Montreal, the heavy favourite for the year, the Leafs managed to win, with Bob Pulford scoring the double-overtime winner in game three; Jim Pappin scored the series winner in Game 6.[54] Keon was named the playoff's most valuable player, and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.[55]\nThe Maple Leafs failed to make the playoffs for two of the decade's last three years. They lost several players to the 1967 expansion drafts, and the team was racked with dissension because of Imlach\u2019s authoritative manner, and his attempts to prevent the players from joining the newly formed Players' Association.[46] Imlach's management of the team was also brought into question due to some of his decisions. It was apparent that he was too loyal to aging players who had been with him since 1958.[46] In 1967\u201368 season, Mahovlich was traded to Detroit in a deal that saw the Leafs acquire Paul Henderson, and Norm Ullman.[56] The Leafs managed to return to the playoffs after the 1968\u201369 season, only to be swept by the Bruins. Immediately after, Stafford Smythe confronted Imlach and fired him.[57] This act was not without controversy, with some older players, including Horton, declaring that, \"if this team doesn't want Imlach, I guess it doesn't want me\".[58]\nThe Maple Leafs completed the 1969\u201370 season out of the playoffs. With their low finish, the Leafs were able to draft Darryl Sittler at the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft.[59] The Leafs returned to the playoffs after the 1970\u201371 season with the addition of Sittler, as well as Bernie Parent and Jacques Plante, who were both acquired through trades during the season.[60] They were eliminated in the first round against the Rangers.\nA series of events in 1971 made Ballard the primary owner of the Maple Leafs. After a series of disputes between Bassett, Ballard and Stafford Smythe, Bassett sold his stake in the company to them.[61] Shortly afterwards, Smythe died in October 1971. Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an executor, each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.[61] Stafford's brother and son tried to keep the shares in the family,[62] but in February 1972 Ballard bought all of Stafford's shares for $7.5 million, valuing the company at $22 million.[63][64][65] Six months later, Ballard was convicted of charges including fraud, and theft of money and goods, and spent a year at Milhaven Penitentiary.[60][61]\nBy the end of 1971, the World Hockey Association (WHA) began operations as a direct competitor to the NHL. Believing the WHA would not be able to compete against the NHL, Ballard's attitude caused the Maple Leafs to lose key players, including Parent to the upstart league.[60] Undermanned and demoralized, the Leafs finished with the fourth-worst record for the 1972\u201373 season. They got the fourth overall pick in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft,[60] and drafted Lanny McDonald. General Manager Jim Gregory also acquired the 10th overall pick from the Philadelphia Flyers, and the 15th overall pick from the Bruins, using them to acquire Bob Neely and Ian Turnbull.[60] In addition to these first round picks, the Leafs also acquired B\u00f6rje Salming during the 1973 off-season.[66]\nDespite acquiring Tiger Williams in the 1974 draft, and Roger Neilson as head coach in the 1977\u201378 season, the Maple Leafs found themselves eliminated in the playoffs by stronger Flyers or Canadiens teams from 1975 to 1979.[60] Although Neilson was a popular coach with fans and his players, he found himself at odds with Ballard, who fired him late in the 1977\u201378 season. Nielson was later reinstated after appeals from the players and public.[67] Nielson and Gregory were fired after the 1979 playoffs, with Imlach named as Gregory's replacement.[60]\nIn the first year of his second stint as general manager, Imlach became embroiled in a dispute with Leafs' captain Darryl Sittler over his attempt to take part in the Showdown series for Hockey Night in Canada.[60][68] In a move to undermine Sittler's influence on the team, Imlach traded McDonald, who was Sittler's friend.[69] By the end of the 1979\u201380 season, Imlach had traded away nearly half of the roster he had at the beginning of his tenure as general manager.[70] With the situation between Ballard and Sittler worsening, Sittler asked to be traded.[71] Forcing the Leafs' hand, the club's new general manager, Gerry McNamara, traded Sittler to the Flyers on January 20, 1982.[72] Rick Vaive was named the team's captain shortly after Sittler's departure.[70]\nThe Maple Leafs' management continued in disarray throughout most of the decade, with an inexperienced McNamara named as Imlach's replacement in September 1981.[70] He was followed by Gord Stellick on April 28, 1988, who was replaced by Floyd Smith on August 15, 1989.[70] Coaching was similarly shuffled often after Nielson's departure. Imlach\u2019s first choice for coach was his former player Smith, although he did not finish the 1979\u201380 season after being hospitalized by a car accident on March 14, 1980.[73] Joe Crozier was named the new head coach until January 10, 1981, when he was succeeded by Mike Nykoluk. Nykoluk was head coach until April 2, 1984.[70] Dan Maloney returned as head coach from 1984 to 1986, with John Brophy named head coach from 1986 to 1988. Both coaches had little success during their tenures.[70][74] Doug Carpenter was named the new head coach to begin the 1989\u201390 season, when the Leafs posted their first season above .500 in the decade.[70]\nThe team did not have much success during the decade, missing the playoffs entirely in 1982, 1984 and 1985.[70] However, the low finishes allowed the team to draft Wendel Clark first overall at the 1985 NHL Entry Draft.[70] Clark managed to lead the Leafs to the playoffs from 1986 to 1988, as well as the 1990 playoffs, although they were always eliminated in the first round.[70] Ballard died on April 11, 1990.[75]\nDon Crump, Don Giffin, and Steve Stavro were named executors of Ballard's estate.[76] Stavro succeeded Ballard as chairman of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. and governor of the Maple Leafs.[77] Cliff Fletcher was hired by Giffin to be the new general manager, although this was opposed by Stavro, who told Fletcher that he wanted to install his own man.[78] Fletcher immediately set about building a competitive club by hiring Pat Burns as the new coach, and by making a series of trades and free agent acquisitions, such as acquiring Doug Gilmour and Dave Andreychuk, which turned the Leafs into a contender.[79] Assisted by stellar goaltending from minor league call-up Felix Potvin, the team posted a then-franchise-record 99 points, and the eighth-best overall record in the NHL.\nToronto dispatched the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round, then defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven games in the Division Finals.[79] Hoping to meet long-time rival Montreal (who was playing in the Wales Conference finals against the New York Islanders) in the Cup finals, the Leafs faced the Los Angeles Kings in the Campbell Conference finals.[79] They led the series 3\u20132, but dropped game six in Los Angeles. The game was not without controversy, as Wayne Gretzky clipped Gilmour in the face with his stick, but referee Kerry Fraser did not call a penalty, and Gretzky scored the winning goal moments later.[80] The Leafs eventually lost in game seven 5\u20134.[79]\nThe Leafs had another strong season in 1993\u201394, starting the season on a 10-game winning streak, and finishing it with 98 points.[79] The team made it to the conference finals again, only to be eliminated by the Vancouver Canucks in five games.[79] At the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, the Leafs packaged Wendel Clark in a multi-player trade with the Quebec Nordiques that landed them Mats Sundin.[79]\nLarry Tanenbaum bought a stake in MLGL in 1996, becoming partners with Stavro. On February 12, 1998, MLGL purchased the Toronto Raptors, a National Basketball Association franchise, and the Air Canada Centre arena the Raptors were building, from Allan Slaight and Scotiabank.[81][82][83] With the acquisition, MLGL was renamed to Maple Leafs Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), acting as the parent company of the two teams.[83]\nMissing two consecutive playoffs in 1997 and 1998, the Leafs relieved Fletcher as general manager.[79] Curtis Joseph was acquired as the team's starting goalie, while Pat Quinn was hired as the head coach before the 1998\u201399 season.[79] Realigning the NHL's conferences in 1998, the Leafs were moved from the Western to the Eastern Conference.[82] On February 13, 1999, the Leafs played their final game at the Gardens before moving to their new home at the Air Canada Centre.[84] In the 1999 playoffs, the team advanced to the Conference Finals, but lost in five games to the Buffalo Sabres.[79]\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, the Leafs hosted the 50th NHL All-Star Game.[85] By the end of the season, they recorded their first 100-point season and won their first division title in 37 years.[86] In both the 2000 and 2001 playoffs, the Leafs defeated the Ottawa Senators in the first round, and lost to the New Jersey Devils in the second round.[86][87] In 2002 playoffs, the Leafs dispatched the Islanders and the Senators, in the first two rounds, only to lose to the Cinderella-story Carolina Hurricanes in the Conference Finals.[88] The 2002 season was particularly impressive in that injuries sidelined many of the Leafs' better players, but the efforts of depth players, including Alyn McCauley, Gary Roberts and Darcy Tucker, led them to the Conference Finals.[89]\nAs Joseph opted to become a free agent during the 2002 off-season, the Leafs signed Ed Belfour as the new starting goaltender.[90] Belfour played well during the 2002\u201303 season and was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy.[91] The Leafs lost to Philadelphia in seven games during the first round of the 2003 playoffs.[92] In 2003, an ownership change occurred in MLSE. Stavro sold his controlling interest in MLSE to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP) and resigned his position as chairman in favour of Tanenbaum.[93] Quinn remained as head coach, but was replaced as general manager by John Ferguson Jr..[94]\nBefore the 2003\u201304 season, the team held their training camp in Sweden and played in the NHL Challenge against teams from Sweden and Finland.[95] The Leafs went on to enjoy a very successful regular season, leading the NHL at the time of the All-Star Game (with Quinn named head coach of the East's All-Star Team). They finished the season with a franchise-record 103 points.[96] They finished with the fourth-best record in the League, and their highest overall finish in 41 years, achieving a .628 win percentage, their best in 43 years, and third-best in franchise history. In the 2004 playoffs, the Leafs defeated the Senators in the first round of the post-season for the fourth time in five years, with Belfour posting three shutouts (setting the record for the most shutouts in a single playoff series) in seven games, but lost to the Flyers in six games during the second round.[96]\nFollowing the 2004\u201305 NHL lock-out, the Maple Leafs experienced their longest playoff drought in the club's history. They struggled in 2005\u201306 and, despite a late-season surge (9\u20131\u20132 in their final 12 games), led by third-string goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin, Toronto was out of playoff contention for the first time since 1998.[97] This marked the first time the team had missed under Quinn, who was later relieved as head coach.[98] Quinn's dismissal was controversial since many of the young players who were key contributors to the Leafs' late-season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson's arrival, while Ferguson's signings (Jason Allison, Belfour, Alexander Khavanov, and Eric Lindros) had suffered season-ending injuries.[98][99]\nPaul Maurice, who previously coached the Maple Leafs' farm team the Toronto Marlies' inaugural season, was named as Quinn's replacement.[100] On June 30, 2006, the Leafs bought out fan-favourite Tie Domi's contract. The team also decided against picking up the option year on goaltender Ed Belfour's contract; he became a free agent.[101] However, despite the coaching change, as well as a shuffle in the roster, the team did not make the playoffs in 2006\u201307. During the 2007\u201308 season, John Ferguson, Jr. was fired in January 2008, and replaced by former Leafs' general manager Cliff Fletcher on an interim basis.[102] The Leafs did not qualify for the post-season, marking the first time since 1928 the team had failed to make the playoffs for three consecutive seasons.[103] It was also Sundin's last year with the Leafs, as his contract was due to expire at the end of the season. However, he refused Leaf management's request to waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to rebuild by acquiring prospects and/or draft picks.[104] On May 7, 2008, after the 2007\u201308 season, the Leafs fired Maurice, as well as assistant coach Randy Ladouceur, naming Ron Wilson as the new head coach, and Tim Hunter and Rob Zettler as assistant coaches.[105]\nOn November 29, 2008, the Maple Leafs hired Brian Burke as their 13th non-interim, and the first American, general manager in team history. The acquisition ended the second Cliff Fletcher era and settled persistent rumours that Burke was coming to Toronto.[106] On June 26, 2009, Burke made his first appearance as the Leafs GM at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, selecting London Knights forward Nazem Kadri with the seventh overall pick.[107] On September 18, 2009, Burke traded Toronto's first- and second-round 2010, as well as its 2011 first-round picks, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for forward Phil Kessel.[108] On January 31, 2010, the Leafs made another high-profile trade, this time with the Calgary Flames in a seven-player deal that brought defenceman Dion Phaneuf to Toronto.[109] On June 14, during the off-season, the Leafs named Phaneuf captain after two seasons without one following Sundin's departure.[110] On February 18, 2011, the Leafs sent long-time Maple Leaf Tomas Kaberle to the Bruins in exchange for prospect Joe Colborne, Boston's first-round pick in 2011, and a conditional second-round draft choice.[111]\nOn March 2, 2012, Burke fired Wilson and named Randy Carlyle the new head coach. However, the termination proved to be controversial as Wilson had received a contract extension just two months prior to being let go.[112] Changes at the ownership level also occurred in August 2012, when the OTPP completed the sale of their shares in MLSE to BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications.[113] On January 9, 2013, Burke was fired as general manager, replaced by Dave Nonis.[114] In their first full season under the leadership of Carlyle, Toronto managed to secure a playoff berth in the 2012\u201313 season (which was shortened again due to another lock-out) for the first time in eight years. However, the Leafs lost in seven games to eventual 2013 Stanley Cup finalist Boston in the first round.[115] Despite the season's success, it was not repeated during the 2013\u201314 season, as the Leafs failed to make the playoffs.[116]\nShortly after the end of the 2013\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 regular season, Brendan Shanahan was named as the president and an alternate governor of the Maple Leafs.[117] On January 6, 2015, the Leafs fired Randy Carlyle as head coach, and assistant coach Peter Horachek took over on an interim basis immediately after the firing.[118] While the Leafs had a winning record before Carlyle's firing, the team eventually collapsed. On February 6, 2015, the Leafs set a new franchise record of 11 consecutive games without a win. At the beginning of February, Shanahan gained the approval of MLSE's Board of Directors to begin a \"scorched earth\" rebuild of the club.[119] Both Dave Nonis and Horachek were relieved of their duties on April 12, just one day after the season concluded. In addition, the Leafs also fired a number of assistant coaches, including Steve Spott, Rick St. Croix; as well as individuals from the Leafs' player scouting department.[120][121]\nOn May 20, 2015, Mike Babcock was named as the new head coach, and on June 23, Lou Lamoriello was named the 16th general manager in team history.[122][123] On July 1, 2015, the Leafs packaged Kessel in a multi-player deal to the Pittsburgh Penguins in return for three skaters, including Kasperi Kapanen and a conditional first round pick, and a third round pick. Toronto also retained $1.2 million of Kessel's salary for the remaining seven seasons of his contract.[124] During the following season, on February 9, 2016, the Leafs packaged Phaneuf in another multi-player deal, acquiring four players, as well as a 2017 2nd-round pick from the Ottawa Senators.[125] The team finished last in the NHL for the first time since the 1984\u201385 season and secured a 20 percent chance at winning the first overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. They were also guaranteed to pick no lower than fourth.[126][127] They subsequently won the draft lottery and used the first overall pick to draft Auston Matthews.[128]\nIn their second season under Babcock, Toronto secured the final Eastern Conference wildcard spot for the 2017 playoffs. On April 23, 2017, the Maple Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs by the top-seeded Washington Capitals. With a score of 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 in the sixth game of the first round, Marcus Johansson scored the winner for the Capitals 6:31 into overtime.[129]\nTickets to Maple Leafs' home games have long been among the most difficult to acquire even during losing seasons.[130] The Air Canada Centre holds 18,900 seats for Leafs games, with 15,500 reserved for season ticket holders.[131] Because of the demand for season tickets, their sale is limited to the 10,000 people on the waiting list. As of March 2016, Leafs' season tickets saw a renewal rate of 99.5 percent, a rate that would require more than 250 years to clear the existing waiting list.[131] With an average of US$1.9 million per game, the Leafs had the highest average ticket revenue per game in the 2007\u201308 season.[132][needs update]\nLeafs' fans have been noted for their loyalty to the team, in spite of its performance.[133][134] In a study conducted by Fanatics in March 2017, the Leafs and the Minnesota Wild were the only two NHL teams to average arena sellouts, with average win percentages below the league's average.[135] In a 2014 survey by ESPN The Magazine, the Leafs were ranked last out of the 122 professional teams in the Big Four leagues. Teams were graded by stadium experience, ownership, player quality, ticket affordability, championships won and \"bang for the buck\"; in particular, the Leafs came last in ticket affordability.[136] Conversely, fans of other teams harbour an equally passionate dislike of the team. In November 2002, the Leafs were named by Sports Illustrated hockey writer Michael Farber as the \"Most Hated Team in Hockey.\"[137]\nDespite their loyalty, there have been several instances where the fanbase voiced their displeasure with the club. During the 2011\u201312 season, fans attending the games chanted for the dismissal of head coach Ron Wilson, and later general manager Brian Burke.[138][139] Wilson was let go shortly after the fans' outburst, even though he had been given a contract extension months earlier. Burke alluded to the chants noting \"it would be cruel and unusual punishment to let Ron coach another game in the Air Canada Centre\".[138] During in the 2014\u201315 season fans threw Leafs jerseys onto the ice to show their disapproval of the team's poor performances in the past few decades.[140] Similarly, during the late-regular season that overlaps with the opening Major League Baseball (MLB) season, and the success of MLB's Toronto Blue Jays, fans have also been heard sarcastically chanting \"Let's go Blue Jays!\" as a sign of their shift in priority from an underperforming team to the start of the 2016 Blue Jays season.[141][142][143]\nMany Leaf fans live outside the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and throughout Ontario, including the Ottawa Valley, the Niagara Region, and Southwestern Ontario.[144][145][146][147] As a result, Leafs-Senators games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa, and Leafs-Sabres games at the KeyBank Center in Buffalo, host a more neutral attendance, due in part to the Leafs fans in those areas, and to those cities' proximity to the GTA and the relative ease in getting tickets to those teams' games.[148][149][150]\nThe Leafs are also a popular team in Atlantic Canada. In November 2016, a survey was conducted that found 20 percent of respondents from Atlantic Canada viewed the Leafs as their favourite team; second only to the Montreal Canadiens at 26 percent.[151] The Leafs were found to be the most favoured team in Prince Edward Island, with 24 percent of respondents favouring the Leafs; and the second favourite team in Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador (19 and 24 percent respectively, both trailing respondents who favoured the Canadiens by one percent).[151]\nDuring the 25 years of the Original Six-era (1942\u00e2\u20ac\u201c67), teams played each other 14 times during the regular season, and with only four teams continuing into the playoffs, rivalries were intense. As one of this era's most successful teams, the Maple Leafs established historic rivalries with the two other most successful teams of the time, the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings.[153]\nBoth teams are Original Six teams, with the clubs' first game played in 1927. From 1929\u20131993, the teams met each other in the 16 playoff series, as well as seven Stanley Cup Finals. Meeting one another for a combined 23 times in the postseason, they have played each other in more postseason series than any other two teams in NHL history with the exception of the Bruins and Canadiens who have played a total of 34 postseason series.[154] The teams are approximately 380 kilometres (240\u00a0mi) apart via Ontario Highway 401\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and their proximity means the number of shared fans (particularly in markets such as Windsor, Ontario) added to the rivalry.[146]\nThe rivalry between the Detroit Red Wings and the Maple Leafs was at its height during the Original Six-era.[152] The Leafs and Red Wings met in the postseason six times during the 1940s, including four Stanley Cup finals. The Leafs beat the Red Wings in five of their six meetings.[155] In the 1950s, the Leafs and Red Wings met one another in six Stanley Cup semifinals; the Red Wings beat the Leafs in five of their six meetings.[156] From 1961 to 1967, the two teams met one another in three playoff series, including two Stanley Cup finals.[157] Within those 25 years, the Leafs and Red Wings played a total of 15 postseason series including six Cup Finals; the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in all six Cup Finals.\nThe teams have only met three times since the Original Six-era, with their last postseason meeting in 1993.[158] After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference in 1998, they faced each other less often, and the rivalry began to stagnate. The rivalry became intradivisional once again in 2013, when Detroit was moved to the Atlantic division of the Eastern Conference as part of a realignment.[159]\nToronto's rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens has been called hockey's greatest.[160] It is the oldest in the NHL, featuring two clubs that were active during the inaugural NHL season in 1917.[161] In the early 20th century, the rivalry was an embodiment of a larger culture war, English Canada versus French Canada.[162] The Canadiens have won 24 Stanley Cups, while the Maple Leafs have won 13, ranking them first and second for most Cup wins.[161]\nThe height of the rivalry was during the 1960s, when the Canadiens and Leafs combined to win all but one Cup. The two clubs had 15 postseason meetings. However, failing to meet each other in the playoffs since 1979, the rivalry has waned.[161] It also suffered when Montreal and Toronto were placed in opposite conferences in 1981, with the Leafs in the Clarence Campbell/Western Conference and the Canadiens in the Prince of Wales/Eastern Conference. In 1998, the Leafs were moved into the Eastern Conference's Northeast Division.[163] This has served to rekindle the rivalry, although the two teams have yet to appear in a playoff series against each other.\nThe rivalry's cultural imprint may be seen in literature and art. The rivalry from the perspective of the Canadiens fan is perhaps most famously captured in the popular Canadian short story \"The Hockey Sweater\" by Roch Carrier. Originally published in French as \"Une abominable feuille d'\u00c3\u00a9rable sur la glace\" (\"An abominable maple leaf on the ice\"), it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater a mother forced her son to wear.[162] The son is presumably based on Carrier himself when he was young.[164] This rivalry is also evident in Toronto's College subway station on Line 1, which displays murals depicting the two teams, one on each platform.[165]\nThe modern Ottawa Senators entered the NHL in 1992, but the rivalry between the two teams did not begin to emerge until the late 1990s. From 1992 to 1998, Ottawa and Toronto played in different conferences (Eastern and Western respectively), which meant they rarely played each other. However, before the 1998\u201399 season, the conferences and divisions were realigned, with Toronto moved to the Eastern Conference's Northeast Division with Ottawa.[163] From 2000 to 2004, the teams played four post-season series; the Leafs won all four playoff series.[166] Due in part to the number Leafs fans living in the Ottawa Valley, and in part to Ottawa's proximity to Toronto, Leafs-Senators games at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa hold a more neutral audience.[144][145][148][167]\nAs a result of both Bell Canada and Rogers Communications having an ownership stake in MLSE, Maple Leafs broadcasts are split between these two media companies. Due to this arrangement, regional TV broadcasts are split between Rogers' Sportsnet Ontario and Bell's TSN4.[4][168] Colour commentary for Bell's television broadcasts is performed by Jamie McLennan and Ray Ferraro, while play-by-play is provided by Chris Cuthbert and Gord Miller. Colour commentary for Rogers' television broadcasts is performed by Greg Millen, while play-by-play is provided by Paul Romanuk. Prior to the 2014\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 season, Leafs TV, a regional specialty channel directly owned by MLSE, also aired selected regional games.\nLike the Maple Leafs television broadcasts, radio broadcasts are split evenly between Rogers' CJCL (Sportsnet 590, The Fan) and Bell's CHUM (TSN Radio 1050).[4] Both Bell and Rogers' radio broadcasts have their colour commentary provided by Jim Ralph, with play-by-play provided by Joe Bowen. Foster Hewitt was the Leafs' first play-by-play broadcaster, providing radio play-by-play from 1927 to 1978. In addition, he provided play-by-play for television from 1952 to 1958, and colour commentary from 1958 to 1961.[169] Originally aired over CFCA, Hewitt's broadcast was picked up by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (the CRBC) in 1933, moving to CBC Radio (the CRBC's successor) three years later.[170] As the show was aired on Canadian national radio, Hewitt became famous for the phrase \"He shoots, he scores!\" as well as his sign-on at the beginning of each broadcast, \"Hello, Canada, and hockey fans in the United States and Newfoundland.\"[171]\nThe team's first home was the Arena Gardens, later known as the Mutual Street Arena, at Mutual and Shuter Streets. From 1912 until 1931, the Arena was ice hockey's premier site in Toronto.[172] The Arena Gardens was the third arena in Canada to feature a mechanically-frozen, or artificial, ice surface and for 11 years was the only such facility in Eastern Canada.[173] The Arena was demolished in 1989, with most of the site converted to residential developments.[174] In 2011, parts of the site were made into a city park, known as Arena Gardens.[175]\nIn 1931, over a six-month period, Conn Smythe built Maple Leaf Gardens on the northwest corner of Carlton Street and Church Street, at a cost of C$1.5 million (C$23.5 million in 2017).[176] Viewed locally as a temple of hockey, it acquired nicknames including the \"Carlton Street Cashbox,\" and the \"Maple Leaf Mint,\" since the team's games were constantly sold out.[177] The Leafs won 11 Stanley Cups while playing at the Gardens. The first annual NHL All-Star Game was also held at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1947.[178] The Gardens opened on November 12, 1931, with the Maple Leafs losing 2\u20131 to the Chicago Blackhawks.[29] On February 13, 1999, the Maple Leafs played their last game at the Gardens, suffering a 6\u20132 loss to the Blackhawks.[84] Maple Leaf Gardens is presently used as a multi-purpose facility, with a Loblaws grocery store occupying retail space on the lower floors, and an athletics arena for Ryerson University, occupying another level.[179][180]\nThe Maple Leafs presently use two facilities in the City of Toronto. The club moved from the Gardens on February 20, 1999, to their current home arena, the Air Canada Centre, a multi-purpose indoor entertainment arena on Bay Street in Downtown Toronto.[181] The arena is owned by the Maple Leafs' parent company MLSE, and is shared with the NBA's Toronto Raptors (another MLSE subsidiary), as well as the National Lacrosse League's Toronto Rock.[182] In addition to the main arena, the Maple Leafs also operate a practice facility at the MasterCard Centre for Hockey Excellence. Opened in 2009 by the Lakeshore Lions Club, the arena adopted the name of the Lions' old arena, the Lakeshore Lions Arena. Facing financial difficulties, in September 2011, the City of Toronto took over ownership of the arena from the Lions' Club. It is now a City of Toronto controlled Corporation.[183][184] Renamed the Mastercard Centre, the facility has three NHL rinks and one Olympic-sized rink.[184]\nThe team is represented through a number of images and symbols, including the maple leaf logo found on the club's uniform, and their mascot. The Maple Leafs' jersey has a long history and is one of the best-selling NHL jerseys among fans.[185] Throughout franchise history, Toronto's uniform has had four major incarnations and many minor alterations. The club's first uniforms were blue and featured the letter T.[186] The first major alteration came in 1919, when the club was renamed the St. Patricks. The uniforms were green with \"Toronto St. Pats\" on the logo, lettered in green either on a white \"pill\" shape or stripes.[2][187]\nWhen the club was renamed the Maple Leafs in the 1927\u201328 season, the logo was changed, and the team reverted to blue uniforms.[27] The logo was a 48-point maple leaf with the words lettered in white. The home jersey was blue with alternating thin-thick stripes on the arms, legs and shoulders. The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back, waist and legs.[188] For 1933\u201334, the alternating thin-thick stripes were replaced with stripes of equal thickness. This remained the basic design for the next 40 years.[188] In 1937, veins were added to the leaf and \"Toronto\" curved downwards at the ends instead of upwards.[189] In 1942, the 35-point leaf was introduced. In 1946, the logo added trimming to the Leaf with a white or blue border, while \"C\" for captain and \"A\" for alternate captain first appeared on the sweaters. In 1947, the \"Toronto Maple Leafs\" lettering was in red for a short time. In 1958, a six-eyelet lace and tie was added to the neck and a blue shoulder yoke was added. In 1961, player numbers were added on the sleeves.[190]\nThe fourth major change came in the 1966\u201367 season, when the logo was changed to an 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new flag of Canada to commemorate the Canadian Centennial.[190] Before the 1970\u201371 season, the Leafs adopted a new 11-point leaf logo, with a Kabel bold-font \"Toronto\" going straight across, running parallel to the other words. Other changes to the sweater removed the arm stripes, extended the yoke to the end of the sleeves, added a solid stripe on the waist, three stripes on the stockings and a miniature Leaf crest on the shoulders.[191] In 1973, the jersey's neck was a lace tie-down design, before the V-neck returned in 1976. In 1977, player names were added to the away jerseys and in 1979 to the home jerseys, but not until after the Leafs were fined by the NHL for refusing to comply with a new rule.[191]\nWith the NHL's 75th anniversary season (1991\u201392 season), the Leafs wore \"Original Six\" style uniforms similar to the designs used in the 1940s.[191] Because of the fan reaction to the previous season's classic uniforms, the first changes to the Leaf uniform in over twenty years were made. Two stripes on the arms and waist were added. A \"TML\" logo was added to the shoulder. The older veined-style Leaf logo was reused as a shoulder crest on the sweater from 1992\u20132000, and again from 2008\u20132016.[191] When the Reebok Edge uniform system was introduced in the 2007\u201308 season, the tail stripes were absent from the change, but returned three years later. In addition, the veined leaf logo returned to the uniforms.[185][192] For the 2014 NHL Winter Classic the Leafs wore a sweater inspired by their earlier uniforms in the 1930s.[192]\nOn February 2, 2016, the team unveiled a new logo for the 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17 season in honour of its centennial, dropping the use of the Kabel-style font lettering used from 1970; it returns the logo to a form inspired by the earlier designs, with 31 points to allude to the 1931 opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, and 17 veins a reference to its establishment in 1917. 13 of the veins are positioned along the top part in honour of its 13 Stanley Cup victories. The logo was subsequently accompanied by a new uniform design that was unveiled during the 2016 NHL Entry Draft on June 24, 2016.[193][194][195]\nThe Maple Leafs' mascot is Carlton the Bear, an anthropomorphic polar bear whose name and number (#60) comes from the location of Maple Leaf Gardens at 60 Carlton Street, where the Leafs played throughout much of their history.[196]\nThe Maple Leafs is one of six professional sports teams owned by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). Initially the ownership of the club was granted to the Arena Gardens of Toronto, Limited; an ownership group fronted by Henry Pellatt, that owned and managed Arena Gardens.[197] After the League's inaugural season, Arena Gardens petitioned the League for a permanent franchise, with team manager Charles Querrie, and the Arena Gardens treasurer Hubert Vearncombe as its owners.[198] Facing financial issues stemming from litigations from Eddie Livingstone, Querrie brokered the sale of the Arena Garden's share to the owners of the amateur St. Patricks Hockey Club.[199][200] Maintaining his shares in the club, Querrie fronted the new ownership group until 1927, when the club was put up for sale. Toronto Varsity Blues coach Conn Smythe put together an ownership group and purchased the franchise for $160,000.[21] In 1929, Smythe decided, in the midst of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena.[28][29] To finance it, Smythe launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited, a publicly traded management company to own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named Maple Leaf Gardens. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL, and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena.[201]\nAlthough Smythe was the face of MLGL from its founding, he did not gain principal ownership of the company until 1947.[202][203][204] Smythe remained the principal owner of the company until 1961, when he sold 90 percent of his shares to an ownership group consisting of Harold Ballard, John Bassett, and Stafford Smythe. Ballard gained principal ownership of the company in February 1972, shortly following the death of Stafford Smythe.[65] Ballard was the principal owner of MLGL until his death in 1990. The company remained a publicly traded company until 1998, when an ownership group fronted by Steve Stavro privatized the company by acquiring more than the 90 percent of stock necessary to force objecting shareholders out.[205][206]\nThe present ownership structure emerged in 2012, after the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (the company's former principal owner) announced the sale of its 75 percent stake in MLSE to a partnership between Bell Canada and Rogers Communications, in a deal valued at $1.32 billion.[207] As part of the sale, two numbered companies were created to jointly hold stock. This ownership structure ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75 percent interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus between the two.[208] The remaining 25 percent is owned by Larry Tanenbaum, who is also the chairman of MLSE.[207] Bell's pension fund is involved in Bell's ownership stake, at least in part, intended to ensure they can retain its existing 18 percent interest in the Montreal Canadiens, as NHL rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30 percent of a team from holding an ownership position in any other team.[209]\nWhile initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of junior hockey clubs including the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, the company later branched out to own the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL from the late 1970s to late 1980s.[210] On February 12, 1998, MLGL purchased the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA), who were constructing the Air Canada Centre. After the Raptors purchase, MLGL changed names to MLSE.[83] The company's portfolio has since expanded to include the Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League, and a 37.5 percent stake in Maple Leaf Square.[211]\nLast change to roster on October 23, 2017[212][213]\nThere have been twenty-one team captains throughout the team's history.[214] Ken Randall served as the team's first captain in the inaugural 1917\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 NHL season.[214] John Ross Roach was the first goaltender to be named captain in the NHL, and the only goaltender to serve as the Leafs' captain.[215][214] He was one of only six goalies in NHL history to have been officially recognized as the team captain. The first captain to have served the position for multiple seasons was Reg Noble, serving as captain from 1920 to 1924.[214] Named captain in 1956, Jimmy Thomson was the first non-Ontarian born captain in Maple Leaf history. In 1997, Mats Sundin became the first non-Canadian to captain the Maple Leafs. His tenure as captain holds the distinction as the longest captaincy for a non-North American born player in NHL history.[216] George Armstrong, captain from 1958 through 1969, was the longest serving captain in the team's history. The last player named to the position was Dion Phaneuf on June 14, 2010. No replacement has been named since he was traded on February 9, 2016.[110][125]\nThree captains of the Maple Leafs have held the position at different points in their career. Syl Apps' first tenure as the captain began from 1940 to 1943, before he stepped down and left the club to enlist in the Canadian Army. Bob Davidson served as the Maple Leafs captain until Apps' return from the Army in 1945, when he resumed his captaincy until 1948.[217] Ted Kennedy's first tenure as captain was from 1948 to 1955. He announced his retirement from the sport at the end of the 1954\u201355 season, with Sid Smith succeeding him as captain.[214] Although Kennedy missed the entire 1955\u201356 season, he came out of retirement to play the second half of the 1956\u201357 season. During that half season, Kennedy served his second tenure as the Maple Leafs' captain.[218] Darryl Sittler was the player to have been named the team's captain twice. As a result of a dispute between Sittler and the Maple Leafs' general manager Punch Imlach, Sittler relinquished the captaincy on December 29, 1979. The dispute was resolved in the following off-season, after a heart attack hospitalized Imlach. Sittler arranged talks with Ballard to resolve the issue, eventually resuming his captaincy on September 24, 1980.[219] No replacement captain was named during the interim period.\nThe Maple Leafs have had 39 head coaches (including four interim coaches).[214] Ten head coaches spent their entire head coaching career with the club. The franchise's first head coach was Dick Carroll, who coached the team for two seasons.[214] Punch Imlach coached the most games of any Leafs' head coach with 750 games, and has the most all-time points with the Maple Leafs, with 865.[214] He is followed by Pat Quinn, who coached 574 games, with 678 points all-time with the Maple Leafs.[214] Quinn also has the most points in a season of any Maple Leafs' coach, with 103 in the 2002\u00e2\u20ac\u201c03 season.[96] Five Maple Leafs' coaches have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, while four others were inducted as builders. Pat Burns is the only Leafs' head coach to win a Jack Adams Award with the team.[220] Both Mike Rodden and Dick Duff, have the fewest points with the Maple Leafs, with 0. Both were interim coaches who coached only two games each in 1927 and 1980 respectively, losing both games.[214] A number of coaches have served as the Leafs head coach on multiple occasions. King Clancy was named the head coach position on three separate occasions while Charles Querrie and Punch Imlach served the position on two occasions.[214] Mike Babcock is the current head coach. He was named as coach on May 20, 2015, signing an eight-year $50-million contract, becoming the highest paid NHL coach in history.[221]\nThe Maple Leafs selected Walt McKechnie, a centre from the London Nationals with their first pick, sixth overall in the 1963 NHL Amateur Draft.[222] Two Maple Leafs captains were obtained through the draft, Darryl Sittler in the 1970 draft; as well as Wendel Clark in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. The Maple Leafs have had 11 top-five draft picks since the draft's inception in 1963. Two of these picks were the first overall draft pick; Clark in the 1985 draft, and Auston Matthews in the 2016 draft.[223] Timothy Liljegren was the most recent player selected by the Maple Leafs in the first round, using the seventeenth overall pick at the 2017 draft.[224]\nThe Maple Leafs have retired the numbers of 19 players (as some players used the same number, only 13 numbers have been retired).[225] Between October 17, 1992, and October 15, 2016, the Maple Leafs took a unique approach to retired numbers. Whereas players who suffered a career ending injury had their numbers retired, \"great\" players had their number \"honoured\".[226] This meant that, although it hung from the rafters, the number was still in team circulation, and could still be worn by other players. During this period, only two players met the criteria, the first being the #6 worn by Ace Bailey retired on February 14, 1934, with Bill Barilko's #5 following on October 17, 1992.[226] The retirement of Bailey's number holds the distinction of being the first retired number in professional sports.[227] It was briefly taken out of retirement before to the 1968\u00e2\u20ac\u201c69 season, after he asked that Ron Ellis be allowed to wear his number.[228] Bailey's number was re-retired after Ellis ended his career. The first players to have their numbers honoured were Syl Apps and Ted Kennedy, on October 3, 1993.[226] Mats Sundin was the last player to have his number honoured on February 11, 2012.[229]\nOn October 15, 2016, before the home opening game of the team's centenary season, the Maple Leafs announced they had changed their philosophy on retiring numbers, and that the numbers of those 16 honoured players would now be retired, in addition to the retirement of Dave Keon's number.[225] As well as honouring and retiring numbers, the club also commissioned statues of a number of former players for the Leafs' Legends Row. As of October 2016, statues have been made of ten players with retired numbers. Legends Row is a 30-foot (9.2m) granite hockey bench with statues of former club players. Unveiled in September 2014, it is located outside Gate 5 of the Air Canada Centre, at Maple Leaf Square.[230]\nThe NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's #99 for all its member teams, including the Maple Leafs, at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.[231]\nThe following members of the Toronto Maple Leafs have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The list includes anyone who played for the Leafs who was later inducted as a player. The list of builders includes inductees who served the Maple Leafs' organization in other roles.\nThese are the top franchise leaders in regular season points, goals, assists, points per game, games played, and goaltending wins as of the end of the 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 season.[235]\nReferences to the Maple Leafs may be found in Canadian movies, television shows, on radio, and in literature. In 1946, the comedy team of Wayne and Shuster performed a sketch on their CBC radio program in which the imaginary hockey team, the Mimico Mice, competed against the Leafs. Foster Hewitt provided the play-by-play of the game, with real player names used for the Leafs and Wayne and Shuster voiced the entire Mimico team.[236] In 1992, Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip released the song \"Fifty Mission Cap,\" which memorialized Bill Barilko.[237]\nReferences to the Leafs in literature includes Foster Hewitt juvenile hockey novel, He Shoots, he scores!. Published in 1949, it featured the members of the team, including actual managers and players.[238] In 1963, Scott Young wrote A Boy at the Leafs' Camp, a children's book giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the sport.[239] In 1971, Young and George Robertson co-wrote an adult hockey-romance novel, Face-off, about the experiences of a star rookie player, Billy Duke, with the Leafs.[240] The novel became a movie in 1971 with Art Hindle as Billy Duke. The film featured many of the players. Jim McKenny, body-doubled for Hindle for the on-ice action scenes because of his resemblance to Hindle. Owner Ballard had a part as the team doctor.[241] In 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the short story The Hockey Sweater about a boy whose mother forces him to wear the hated the Maple Leafs sweater he has been given as a present, instead of a sweater for his beloved Montreal Canadiens. In 1980, the story was turned into an animated short by the National Film Board of Canada.[242]\nReferences to the Leafs may also be found in film. In 1993, the film Gross Misconduct was about the life of former Maple Leaf Brian Spencer.[243] Comedian Mike Myers, a fan, often included references and even an entire plot line in his films. In Austin Powers in Goldmember, the ticker below the news item on a television reads, \"Maple Leafs win Stanley Cup.\" In another scene, the character Mini-Me wears a Maple Leafs sweater.[244] Myers played a guru hired to help the Leafs' star player in the 2008 movie The Love Guru.[245] At the beginning of the 2010 spy film Fair Game, CIA agent Valerie Plame is being questioned by a suspicious weapons trafficker. He asks her if she is an American, and after responding that she is Canadian, he asks her about the Leafs. She replies that she is not a fan.[246]",

        "text": "George Robert Newhart (born September 5, 1929) is an American stand-up comedian and actor, noted for his deadpan and slightly stammering delivery. Newhart came to prominence in 1960 when his album of comedic monologues, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, became a worldwide bestseller and reached number one on the Billboard pop album chart; it remains the 20th-best selling comedy album in history.[10] The follow-up album, The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!, was also a success, and the two albums held the Billboard number one and number two spots simultaneously.[7]\nNewhart later went into acting, starring as Chicago psychologist Dr. Robert Hartley in The Bob Newhart Show during the 1970s and then as Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon on the 1980s series Newhart. He also had two short-lived sitcoms in the 1990s titled Bob and George and Leo. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as Major Major in Catch-22 and Papa Elf in Elf. He provided the voice of Bernard in the Walt Disney animated films The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under. In 2004, he played the library head Judson in The Librarian, a character which continued in 2014 to the TV series The Librarians. In 2013, Newhart made his first of five guest appearances on The Big Bang Theory as Professor Proton, for which he received his first Primetime Emmy Award on September 15, 2013.[11]\nNewhart was born on September 5, 1929 at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park, Illinois.[12] His parents were George David Newhart (1899\u20131986), a part-owner of a plumbing and heating-supply business, and Julia Pauline (n\u00e9e Burns; 1901\u20131991), a housewife. His mother was of Irish descent and his father was of English, Irish, and German ancestry.[7][13] One of his grandmothers was from St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.[14] Newhart has three sisters: Virginia, Mary Joan (a nun, who taught at the all-girls Carmel High School in Mundelein, Illinois), and Pauline.\nNewhart was educated at Roman Catholic schools in the Chicago area, including St. Catherine of Siena grammar school in Oak Park, and attended St. Ignatius College Prep (high school), graduating in 1947. He then enrolled at Loyola University of Chicago from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in business management.\nNewhart was drafted into the United States Army and served in the United States during the Korean War as a personnel manager until being discharged in 1954. Newhart briefly attended Loyola University Chicago School of Law, but did not complete a degree, in part, he says, because he was asked to behave unethically during an internship.[7]\nAfter the war, Newhart worked for United States Gypsum as an accountant. He later said that his motto, \"That's close enough\" and his habit of adjusting petty cash imbalances with his own money shows he did not have the temperament to be an accountant.[7] He also said he was a clerk in the unemployment office who made $55 a week, but who quit upon learning unemployment benefits were $45 a week and he \"only had to come in to the office one day a week to collect it.\"[15]\nIn 1958, Newhart became an advertising copywriter for Fred A. Niles, a major independent film and television producer in Chicago.[16] There, he and a co-worker entertained each other with long telephone calls about absurd scenarios, which they later recorded and sent to radio stations as audition tapes. When his co-worker ended his participation, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing this type of routine.\nDan Sorkin, a disc jockey at a radio station who later became the announcer-sidekick on Newhart's NBC series, introduced Newhart to the head of talent at Warner Bros. Records. The label signed him in 1959, only a year after it was formed, based solely on those recordings. Newhart expanded his material into a stand-up routine, which he began to perform at nightclubs.[7]\nNewhart became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he played a solo \"straight man\". Newhart's routine was to portray one end of a conversation (usually a phone call), playing the comedic straight man and implying what the other person was saying.\nHis 1960 comedy album, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, was the first comedy album to make number one on the Billboard charts.[17] The album received the 1961 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The album peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart.[18] Newhart also won Best New Artist.\nNewhart told a 2005 interviewer for PBS's American Masters that his favorite stand-up routine is \"Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue\", which appears on this album. In the routine, a slick promoter has to deal with the reluctance of the eccentric President to agree to efforts to boost his image. The routine was suggested to Newhart by Chicago TV director and future comedian Bill Daily, who was Newhart's castmate on the 1970s The Bob Newhart Show for CBS. Newhart became known for using an intentional stammer, in service to his unique combination of politeness and disbelief at what he was supposedly hearing. Newhart has used the delivery throughout his career.\nThe follow-up album, The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back, was released six months later and won Best Comedy Performance - Spoken Word that same year. Subsequent comedy albums include Behind the Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart (1961), The Button-Down Mind on TV (1962), Bob Newhart Faces Bob Newhart (1964), The Windmills Are Weakening (1965), This Is It (1967), Best of Bob Newhart (1971), and Very Funny Bob Newhart (1973). Years later, he released Bob Newhart Off the Record (1992), The Button-Down Concert (1997), and Something Like This (2001), an anthology of his 1960s Warner Bros. albums.\nOn December 10, 2015, it was revealed by publicist and comedy album collector Jeff Abraham that a \"lost\" Newhart track from 1965 about Paul Revere existed on a one-of-a-kind acetate, which he owns. The track made its world premiere on episode 163 of the Comedy on Vinyl podcast.[19]\nNewhart's success in stand-up led to his own short-lived NBC variety show in 1961, The Bob Newhart Show. The show lasted only a single season, but it earned Newhart a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and a Peabody Award. The Peabody Board cited him as:\nIn the mid-1960s, Newhart appeared on The Dean Martin Show 24 times, and on The Ed Sullivan Show eight times.[7] He appeared in a 1963 episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, \"How to Get Rid of Your Wife\", and on The Judy Garland Show. Newhart guest-hosted The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson 87 times, and hosted Saturday Night Live twice, 15 years apart (1980 and 1995).\nIn addition to stand-up comedy, Newhart became a dedicated character actor. This led to other series such as: Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Captain Nice, two episodes of Insight, and It's Garry Shandling's Show. He reprised his role as Dr. Bob Hartley on Murphy Brown, and appeared as himself on The Simpsons, and as a retired forensic pathologist on NCIS.\nNewhart guest-starred on three episodes of ER, for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award,[7] as well as on Desperate Housewives and a role on NCIS as Ducky's mentor and predecessor, who was discovered to have Alzheimer's disease. In 2013, he also appeared on Committed and appeared in an episode of the sixth season of The Big Bang Theory, for which he was awarded a Primetime Emmy Award, and subsequent episodes of its seventh season.[20]\nAlthough he is primarily a television star, Newhart has been in a number of popular films, beginning with the 1962 war story Hell Is for Heroes. In 1968, Newhart played an annoying software specialist in the film Hot Millions. His films have ranged from 1970's Alan Jay Lerner musical On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, the 1971 Norman Lear comedy Cold Turkey, the Mike Nichols-directed war satire Catch 22, the Walt Disney animated feature The Rescuers in 1977 and with its 1990 sequel The Rescuers Down Under, and the Will Ferrell holiday comedy Elf (2003).\nNewhart played the President of the United States in the comedy, First Family (1980). He appeared as a beleaguered school principal in In & Out (1997). He made a cameo appearance as a sadistic but appreciative CEO at the end of the comedy Horrible Bosses (2011).\nNewhart's most notable exposure on television came from two long-running programs that centered on him. In 1972, soon after Newhart guest-starred on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, he was approached by his agent and his managers, producer Grant Tinker, and actress Mary Tyler Moore (the husband/wife team who founded MTM Enterprises), to work on a pilot series called The Bob Newhart Show, to be written by Davis and Music. He was very interested in the starring role of dry psychologist Bob Hartley, with Suzanne Pleshette playing his wry, loving wife, Emily, and Bill Daily as neighbor and friend Howard Borden.\nThe Bob Newhart Show faced heavy competition from the beginning, launching at the same time as the popular shows M*A*S*H, Maude, Sanford And Son, and The Waltons. Nevertheless, it was an immediate hit. The show eventually referenced what made Newhart's name in the first place. Apart from the first few episodes, it used an opening-credits sequence featuring Newhart answering a telephone in his office. According to co-star Marcia Wallace, the entire cast got along well, and Newhart became close friends with both Wallace and co-star Suzanne Pleshette.\nThe cast also included Marcia Wallace as Bob's wisecracking, man-chasing receptionist, Carol Kester; Peter Bonerz as amiable orthodontist Dr. Jerry Robinson; Jack Riley as Elliot Carlin, the most misanthropic of Dr. Hartley's patients; character actor and voice artist, John Fiedler as milquetoast Emil Petersen; and Pat Finley as Bob's sister, Ellen Hartley, a love interest for Howard Borden. Future Newhart regular Tom Poston had a briefly recurring role as Cliff \"Peeper\" Murdock, veteran stage actor Barnard Hughes appeared as Bob's father for three episodes spread over two seasons, and Martha Scott appeared in several episodes as Bob's mother.\nBy 1977, the show's ratings were declining and Newhart wanted to end it, but was under contract to do one more season. The show's writers tried to rework the sitcom by adding a pregnancy, but Newhart objected: \"I told the creators I didn't want any children, because I didn't want it to be a show about 'How stupid Daddy is, but we love him so much, let's get him out of the trouble he's gotten himself into'.\" Nevertheless, the staff wrote an episode that they hoped would change Newhart's mind. Newhart read the script and he agreed it was very funny. He then asked, \"Who are you going to get to play Bob?\"[21] Coincidentally, Newhart's wife gave birth to their daughter Jenny late in the year, which caused him to miss several episodes.\nIn the last episode of the fifth season, not only was Bob's wife, Emily, pregnant, but his receptionist, Carol, was, too. In the first show of the sixth season, Bob revealed his dream of the pregnancies and that neither Emily nor Carol was really pregnant.\nMarcia Wallace spoke of Newhart's amiable nature on set: \"He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I had a dog by the name of Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And whenever there was a line that Bob didn't like\u2014he didn't want to complain too much\u2014so, he'd go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'\" Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: \"People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!\"\nNewhart discontinued the series in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, \"It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together.\" Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, \"But some of the other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well.\" She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.\nBy 1982, Newhart was interested in a new sitcom. After he had discussions with Barry Kemp and CBS, the show Newhart was created, in which Newhart played Vermont innkeeper and TV talk show host Dick Loudon. Mary Frann was cast as his wife, Joanna. Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after former daytime soap star Julia Duffy joined the cast as Dick's inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen. Peter Scolari (who had been a fan of Newhart's since he was 17) was also cast as Dick's manipulative TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons. Character actor Tom Poston played the role of handyman George Utley, earning three Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1984, 1986, and 1987. Like The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart was an immediate hit, and again, like the show before it, it was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habit finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary polycythemia. The doctors ordered him to stop smoking.\nIn 1987, ratings began to drop. Newhart ended in 1990 after eight seasons and 182 episodes. The last episode ended with a scene in which Newhart wakes up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette, who had played Emily, his wife from The Bob Newhart Show. He realizes (in a satire of a famous plot element in the television series Dallas a few years earlier) that the entire eight-year Newhart series had been a single nightmare of Dr. Bob Hartley's, which Emily attributes to eating Japanese food before he went to bed. Recalling Mary Frann's buxom figure and proclivity for wearing sweaters, Bob closes the segment and the series by telling Emily, \"You really should wear more sweaters\" before the typical closing notes of the old Bob Newhart Show theme played over the fadeout. The twist ending was later chosen by TV Guide as the best finale in television history.\nIn 1992, Newhart returned to television with a series called Bob, about a cartoonist. An ensemble cast included Lisa Kudrow, but the show did not develop a strong audience and was cancelled shortly after the start of its second season, despite good critical reviews. (On The Tonight Show following the cancellation, Newhart joked he had now done shows called The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart and Bob so his next show was going to be called The.)\nIn 1997, Newhart returned again with George & Leo on CBS with Judd Hirsch and Jason Bateman; the show was cancelled during its first season.\nIn 1995, a 65-year-old Newhart was approached by the Showtime cable network to do the first comedy special in his 35-year career. His special Off The Record consisted of him doing material from his first and second albums in front of a live audience in Pasadena, California. In 2003, Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of ER in a rare dramatic role that earned him an Primetime Emmy Award nomination, his first in nearly 20 years. In 2005, he began a recurring role in Desperate Housewives as Morty, the on-again/off-again boyfriend of Sophie (Lesley Ann Warren), Susan Mayer's (Teri Hatcher) mother. In 2009, he received another Primetime Emmy nomination for reprising his role as Judson in The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice.\nOn August 27, 2006, at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, hosted by Conan O'Brien, Newhart was placed in a supposedly airtight glass prison that contained three hours of air. If the Emmys went over the time of three hours, he would die. This gag was an acknowledgment of the common frustration that award shows usually run on past their allotted time (which is usually three hours). Newhart \"survived\" his containment to help O'Brien present the award for Outstanding Comedy Series (which went to The Office).\nDuring an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Newhart made a comedic cameo with members of ABC's show Lost lampooning an alternate ending to the series finale. In 2011, Newhart appeared in a small but pivotal role as a doctor in Lifetime's anthology film on breast cancer Five, and in 2013, he made a guest appearance on The Big Bang Theory as the aged Professor Proton (Arthur Jeffries), a former science TV show host turned children's party entertainer, for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[24] It marked the first Emmy in Newhart's entire career. At that year's Emmy ceremony, Newhart appeared as a presenter with Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons and received an unexpected standing ovation.\nOn December 19, 2014, Newhart made a surprise appearance on the final episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, where he was revealed to be the person inside Secretariat, Ferguson's on-set pantomime horse. The show then ended with a scene parodying the Newhart series finale, with Ferguson and Drew Carey reprising their roles from The Drew Carey Show. In June 2015, Newhart appeared on another series finale, the final episode of Hot in Cleveland playing the father-in-law of Joy Scroggs (Jane Leeves). It marked a reunion with one time co-star Betty White who had been a cast member during the second season of Bob 23 years earlier. The finale ends with their characters getting married.\nNewhart is known for his deadpan delivery and a slight stammer which he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career.[7] On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the Jack Benny tradition of being the \"straight man\" while the sometimes rather bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs. Newhart, however, has stated that \"I was not influenced by Jack Benny\" in terms of his style or persona, and cites George Gobel and the comedy team of Bob and Ray as his initial writing and performance inspirations.[25]\nSeveral of his routines involve hearing one-half of a conversation as he speaks to someone over the phone. In a bit called \"King Kong\", a rookie security guard at the Empire State Building seeks guidance as to how to deal with an ape that is \"between 18 and 19 stories high, depending on whether there's a 13th floor or not.\" He assures his boss he has looked in the guards' manual \"under 'ape' and 'ape's toes'.\" Other famous routines include \"The Driving Instructor\", \"The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (and Storm Door Company)\", \"Introducing Tobacco to Civilization\", \"Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue\", \"Defusing a Bomb\" (in which an uneasy police chief tries to walk a new and nervous patrolman through defusing a live shell discovered on a beach), \"The Retirement Party\", \"Ledge Psychology\", \"The Krushchev Landing Rehearsal\", and \"A Friend With a Dog.\"\nIn a 2012 podcast interview with Marc Maron, comedian Shelley Berman accused Newhart of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style.[26] However, in interviews both years before and after Berman's comments, Newhart has never taken credit for originating the telephone concept, which he has noted was done earlier by Berman and -- predating Berman -- Nichols and May, George Jessel (in his well-known sketch \"Hello Mama\"), and in the 1913 recording \"Cohen on the Telephone\". The technique would later also be used by Lily Tomlin, Ellen DeGeneres, and many others.[27][25]\nOn September 20, 2006, Hyperion Books released Newhart's first book, I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This. The book is primarily a memoir, but features comic bits by Newhart, as well. Transcripts of many of Newhart's classic routines are woven in with the rest of the text. As actor David Hyde Pierce notes, \"The only difference between Bob Newhart on stage and Bob Newhart offstage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that there is no stage.\"[28]\nIn addition to his Peabody Award and several Primetime Emmy Award nominations, Newhart's recognitions include:\nNewhart was introduced by Buddy Hackett to Virginia \"Ginnie\" Quinn, the daughter of character actor Bill Quinn.[7] They were married on January 12, 1963. The couple have four children (Robert, Timothy, Jennifer, and Courtney), and ten grandchildren.[1] They are Roman Catholic and raised their children as such.[31] He is a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.[32]\nNewhart's best friend was comedian Don Rickles, who nicknamed him \"Charlie Everybody\" for his everyman persona.\nIn 1985, Newhart was rushed to the emergency room, suffering from secondary polycythemia, after years of heavy smoking. He made a recovery, several weeks after, and has since quit smoking.[7]\nNewhart was an early home-computer hobbyist, purchasing the Commodore PET after its 1977 introduction. He wrote in 2001, \"Later, I moved up to the 64 KB model and thought that was silly because it was more memory than I would ever possibly need.\"[33]\nNewhart sold his Wallace Neff-designed Bel Air mansion to Canadian Robert Quigg in May 2016 for $14.5\u00c2\u00a0million.[34]",

        "text": "The fourth season of the American television series The Flash, which is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, follows a crime scene investigator with superhuman speed who fights criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow. The season is produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment, with Andrew Kreisberg and Todd Helbing serving as showrunners.\nThe season was ordered in January 2017, and filming began that July. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, with principal cast members Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Keiynan Lonsdale, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin also returning from previous seasons, and are joined by Neil Sandilands.\nThe fourth season began airing on October 10, 2017, and is set to run for 23 episodes on The CW until May 22, 2018.[1]\nBarry, Oliver, Sara, Alex, Martin and Jax wake up in a Nazi concentration camp on Earth-X wearing power dampeners. The arriving SS Sturmbannf\u00fchrer is revealed to be the Earth-X doppelg\u00e4nger of Quentin Lance, who plans to execute them, but they are saved by Citizen Cold (the Earth-X doppelg\u00e4nger of Leonard Snart) and Ray Terrill. Snart and Terrill take them to the headquarters of the Freedom Fighters, where the team meets the resistance movement's leader, General Schott (Winn Schott's Earth-X doppelg\u00e4nger). They learn that the only way back to Earth-1 is through a temporal gateway in a research facility, which Schott plans to blow up to strand Dark Arrow (Oliver's Earth-X doppelg\u00e4nger) on Earth-1. Oliver disguises himself as Dark Arrow to infiltrate the facility and discovers the Nazi doomsday device against parallel Earths is a militarized timeship called Wellenreiter. Barry and Ray battle the Freedom Fighters' Red Tornado to stop it from destroying the gateway while the rest of the team enters the facility to reactivate its portal, during which Stein is shot and gravely wounded. On Earth-1, Eobard Thawne prepares to perform surgery on Kara to save Overgirl. Felicity and Iris try to stop him, but are captured.\nThe series was renewed for a fourth season on January 8, 2017,[56] earlier than usual for the series. Executive producer Andrew Kreisberg said on this, \"The great thing about our dear friends at The CW and Mark Pedowitz picking the shows up as early as they did has allowed us to start building the schedules for next season.\"[57] In May 2017, it was announced that Aaron Helbing would not return as an executive producer for season four, with only Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg, Sarah Schechter, and Todd Helbing returning from previous seasons.[58] Todd Helbing and Kreisberg were slated to serve as the season's showrunners.[59][60] In November 2017, Kreisberg was suspended from his role as executive producer and showrunner on The Flash over allegations of sexual harassment.[61][62] By the end of the month, he had been fired, with his name eventually being removed from the credits from all shows he worked on. In addition, Berlanti would take additional responsibilities working with Helbing to co-showrun the season.[63]\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGrant Gustin on the rebirth of Barry in season four.[64]\nIn March 2017, Kreisberg confirmed that the main villain for the fourth season would not be a speedster, like the previous three seasons.[65] Executive producers Aaron and Todd Helbing also mentioned that there would be less time travel in the season, with Aaron saying, \"We like playing with the timelines and the different time periods and future and past. For now, I think we're going to focus on the present.\"[66] In June 2017, Clifford DeVoe / Thinker was reported to be the main antagonist of the season. He was first hinted in the third season episode \"Abra Kadabra\" when the titular villain mentions him among the Flash's greatest enemies, and again in the season finale \"Finish Line\" when Savitar mentions facing DeVoe but states that the Flash has not dealt with him yet.[67] At the series' San Diego Comic-Con panel, the speculation was confirmed, with Todd Helbing saying, \"With three Speedsters in a row, this year it's the fastest man alive against the fastest mind alive.\"[29] He added that the writers were \"making a conscious effort this year to get the fun quotient back up\".[68]\nRegarding the possibility of Wally West taking on the mantle of the Flash in Barry's absence, Keiynan Lonsdale said that \"It's not something that's on my radar. I feel as though there is so much story to tell and Wally has so much growing to do... We need to see how these character realistically get to where they are headed for.\"[69] With the action picking up six months after season three, Kid Flash and Vibe are left to protect Central City, with Carlos Valdes saying \"the team is sort of clutching at straws to keep the city together,... there is a unanimous feeling amongst the remaining members that it's just not the same without Barry... So in light of that, Cisco does whatever it takes to get his friends back.\"[70] Valdes also confirmed the return of Cisco's more lighthearted joking manner.[70] Candice Patton explained Iris West's larger role within Team Flash as \"a way of distracting herself,\"[70] adding that \"[Iris] is forced to deal with that anger and resentment and abandonment by kind of focusing on protecting Central City... We're seeing a very different Iris, almost a very hardened Iris.\"[71] Kreisberg also hinted at some major growth for Iris this season, and noted that \"the season premiere is all about Iris and Cisco, not Barry\".[72]\nIn July 2017, Sterling Gates, DC Comics comic book writer, joined as a member of the fourth season's writing staff.[73] At the Television Critics Association press tour in August 2017, Pedowitz stated that the fourth season of The Flash is \"going to try to find the lightness... of the Barry Allen of the first two seasons,\"[74] and said that the show was likely \"done with Speedster villains\".[75] Later in the month, Kreisberg confirmed the return of Harry Wells from Earth-2, saying that \"season 4 for Harry is really realizing what he's missing in his life and what it is he needs to become a better, more complete person, and so he's going to be going on a fairly epic emotional journey this season that is tied to the Thinker's plan,\" in addition to confirming the introduction of a new version of the Wells character.[76]\nIn September 2017, Helbing noted \"There's a lot of love in the air this season,\" and compared Barry and Iris' reunion to \"somebody going off to war for six months and coming back. There's a lot that Iris experienced that Barry didn't when he was gone, and it's really [about] the fun and the emotional component of making up that time when they weren't together.\" Helbing also explained that the Speed Force \"let [Barry] deal with all of the baggage [from the past three seasons]. When he comes out, he's sort of left that all behind.\"[77] That month, Kreisberg also confirmed that Barry and Iris will be getting married this season,[78] while also revealing that the pair will be going to couples therapy since \"[they] keep comically clashing inadvertently because [both are] used to being in charge, and so they wind up going... to work through it.\" He added, \"The two of them with the therapist is some of the funniest stuff we have ever done on this show, but it also leads to a deepening of their relationship.\"[79]\nMain cast members Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Keiynan Lonsdale, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin return from previous seasons as Barry Allen / The Flash, Iris West, Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost, Cisco Ramon / Vibe, Wally West / Kid Flash, Harrison Wells, and Joe West, respectively.[26] Cavanagh will portray Harry Wells from Earth-2 at the start of the season, without ruling out the possibility of introducing another incarnation of the Wells character later on.[70] Teasing the arrival of a new Harrison Wells, Cavanagh said, \"We're going to start with Harry and then find a way, I think, to try and get a different version of Wells in there, be it some version of Harry or whatnot as the season's gaps present themselves.\"[80] Also returning from earlier in the series are Jessica Camacho as Gypsy,[30] and Anne Dudek as Tracy Brand.[54] It was revealed that Tom Felton, who joined the cast as Julian Albert in the third season, would not be a series regular in the fourth season, and that there were no plans for him to appear.[81] Julian's absence will be addressed \"pretty quickly\u00a0\u2014 there's a reason why he's no longer with the team,\" said Helbing.[82] In the season premiere, it is revealed that Julian has returned to London.[83] Kreisberg also confirmed that he had put on hold the planned return of Violett Beane as Jesse Quick due to the high number of speedsters on the show, but did not rule out a possible return in the future.[84] Beane eventually appeared as Jesse on the episode \"Luck Be a Lady\".[41] Britne Oldford, who previously appeared as Shawna Baez / Peek-a-Boo in the first season and the web series The Chronicles of Cisco, reprised her role in the season premiere.[37]\nIn July 2017, Neil Sandilands was announced to be cast as Clifford DeVoe, a metahuman genius who embarks on a seasonlong battle with the Flash in order to fix all that he deems wrong with humanity; while Kim Engelbrecht was announced as The Mechanic, Devoe's right hand and a highly intelligent engineer who designs devices for him; and Danny Trejo as Breacher, a bounty hunter from Earth-19 and the father of Gypsy.[28] Also in June, the series was looking to cast a role that \"should put the visual effects department to the test\",[85] with the role later revealed to be Ralph Dibny / Elongated Man, a metahuman with the ability to stretch his body to superhuman lengths and sizes.[86] Hartley Sawyer was cast in the recurring role that July as the fast-talking private investigator who after discovering his abilities will help Team Flash solve one of Central City's greatest mysteries.[34] The character was previously mentioned in the first season, as one of the fourteen people who seemingly died as a result of the particle accelerator explosion.[87] The next month, Katee Sackhoff was announced in the recurring role of Amunet Black / Blacksmith, who operates an underground black market of metahuman supervillains.[35]\nFilming for the season began on July 4, 2017,[88] in Vancouver, British Columbia, and is set to conclude on April 21, 2018.[89] Kevin Smith will return to direct an episode in January 2018.[90]\nIn August 2017, series composer Blake Neely and Nathaniel Blume began to compose the music for the fourth season.[91]\nIn May 2017, The CW president Mark Pedowitz officially announced plans for a four-show Arrowverse crossover event, crossing over episodes of the television series Supergirl, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Arrow.[92] The crossover, Crisis on Earth-X, began with Supergirl and a special airing of Arrow on November 27, 2017, and concluded on The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow on November 28.[93] In August 2017, Berlanti noted that it would be \"a big life event for a few different people\" that would bring them all together for the crossover, adding \"There are many life events that happen.\"[94] Prior to that, Arrow actress Emily Bett Rickards appears as Felicity Smoak in the fifth episode of the season.[35]\nThe season began airing on October 10, 2017, on The CW in the United States,[95] and on CTV in Canada.[96] Sky One acquired the rights to air the season in the UK & Ireland, airing it alongside the other Arrowverse shows. The season premiered October 17.[97][98]\nIn July 2017, cast from the series appeared at San Diego Comic-Con International to promote the season, where exclusive footage was shown.[99] During the panel, a trailer for the season was shown, with James Whitbrook at io9 feeling that despite the \"grim\" tone, there was \"some fun signs of the team coming together to protect the city without [Barry],... Sprinkle in a few wacky things, like, say a goddamn Samuroid ripped straight from the comics, and ladies and gents, you've got a good season of The Flash lined up.\"[100] Ben Pearson with /Film felt seeing Iris West deal with the absence of Barry was \"a nice change of pace for that character\", but anticipated that \"Barry [would] be back two or three episodes in at the latest.\"[101] Collider.com's Allison Keene also noted Iris \"getting an actual storyline\" with Barry gone, and similarly presumed that he \"[would] be back in the fold by the end of the first episode\" alike to Flashpoint in the third season. She added, \"There are some new foes, lots of action, plenty of tech\u00a0\u2014 it's great!\"[102]\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 7.36/10 based on 14 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"After an unsteady turn in season three, The Flash returns to its roots with a fourth season packed with humor, spectacle, and a whole lot of heart.\"[119]\nReviewing the first two episodes of the season, Allison Keene writing for Collider.com, felt the premiere \"wipes the slate clean, fixing a lot of the issues that plagued the end of the last season, and setting up a much more toned-down storyline. Most importantly, it's brought back some fun.\" She added that with a \"streamlined team,\" the core characters now have time to interact and have meaningful plot lines. On the second episode, Keene described it as \"truly a delight\" with the show taking \"the time to focus on character relationships, and not just romantic relationships\" and each character \"feeling like a refreshed version of themselves, with new narrative purpose\". She also highlighted the setup of the Thinker \"as an Alchemy-like villain who manipulates evil metas into the Flash's path as part of some kind of masterplan\", saying \"The Flash is a series that truly works best as a procedural, with the team finding creative ways to bring down Villains of the Week.\"[120]",

        "text": "Taylor Hayes is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, portrayed by Hunter Tylo. The character was created by William J. Bell and debuted during the episode dated June 6, 1990. Tylo appeared as a regular continuously until 1994 when she took a hiatus for a few months before being written back into the series. In 1996, she left the serial after being cast on Melrose Place, where she was soon fired on the grounds of being pregnant, and returned shortly after. In 2002, Tylo and the show's executive producer Bradley Bell had mutually agreed that the character was \"played out\", and Taylor was subsequently killed off, last appearing on October 30, 2002. Tylo returned in 2004, reprising Taylor as a ghost. She returned on a permanent basis in April 2005, with the character revealed to be alive. Tylo exited The Bold and the Beautiful again in July 2013, but returned for multiple guest appearances in 2014. She returned again in April 2018.\nA Los Angeles-based \"globally renowned\" psychiatrist, Taylor was introduced to facilitate social issues and act as a romantic lead. In her early years, Taylor was characterized as \"pristine\" and \"well-mannered\", as well as being the \"good girl\" of the show. Most of her history revolved around her relationship with love interest Ridge Forrester. Tylo emerged as a fan favorite in the 1990s, with Ridge and Taylor considered a soap opera supercouple. Taylor rivaled Brooke Logan for Ridge's affections, with a love triangle between the three becoming a focus on the soap opera for many years. The characters' rivalry resulted in the \"Brooke and Taylor wars\" among fans, which has split audience opinions.[3][4]\nRidge and Taylor were married twice, and had three children: a son Thomas, and twin daughters Phoebe (who died in 2008) and Steffy. After Taylor's apparent death in 2002, Ridge married Brooke. When Taylor returned in 2005, she and Ridge had a short-lived reunion before the end of their marriage. Upon her reintroduction, Tylo stated that the character became \"more real\", experiencing alcoholism and depression. In the years that ensued, she became involved with Ridge's brother Thorne after accidentally causing the death of his wife in a hit and run accident, and also had short-lived marriages to Nick Marone and Whip Jones. The character relocated to Paris after a brief relationship with Ridge's father Eric.\nBefore her first appearance on the show, Taylor dated Storm Logan (Ethan Wayne) in high school. Her father is Jack Hamilton (Chris Robinson),[5] and she has a younger brother, Zachary. Taylor's mother, Sharon, died when she was a child which led to Jack's gambling addiction. Her chaotic childhood led to Taylor becoming a psychiatrist. She was in an abusive relationship with Blake Hayes (Peter Brown) who also stalked her.[6]\nTaylor begins counseling Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) and his wife Caroline Spencer Forrester (Joanna Johnson) when Caroline is diagnosed with leukemia. After Caroline's death, Ridge takes interest in Taylor, to the dismay of his ex Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). Storm (Brian Patrick Clarke) and Taylor briefly date and he proposes to her at Christmas 1990[7] but she refuses. Ridge and Taylor begin a relationship which is temporarily broken up by Brooke; Ridge follows Taylor to St. Thomas Island and successfully wins her back. The couple marry in 1992; Taylor befriends Ridge's overprotective mother Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). In 1993 while trapped in a cabin at Big Bear and suffering from hypothermia, Taylor sleeps with her mentor from medical school James Warwick (Ian Buchanan) to prevent him from dying a virgin. A guilty Taylor writes Ridge a note confessing her infidelity, but she is presumed dead after a plane crash in April 1994.[8] Stephanie destroys Taylor's letter, and Ridge eventually remarries Brooke. However, Taylor is revealed to be alive and suffering from amnesia. She was assaulted by drug dealers who took her place on the plane.[9] She is rescued by Prince Omar Rashid (Kabir Bedi) and taken to his palace in Morocco. Omar holds Taylor captive when she regains her memories;[10] she lives under the alias Princess Laila and is coerced into marrying Omar, effectively committing bigamy (the marriage was declared void).[11] Taylor ultimately returns to California. She poses as a British nurse taking care of a temporarily blinded Ridge before revealing herself to family and friends in May 1995.[12] Ridge and Taylor's marriage ends shortly afterward and he decides to remain with Brooke.\nIn 1997, Taylor discovers that she is pregnant with Ridge's child. Mistakenly believing that he wants Brooke, she allows Ridge's half-brother Thorne Forrester (Winsor Harmon) to claim he is the father instead. After Taylor gives birth to Thomas Forrester in 1998, Ridge learns the truth and they remarry. In 1999, Taylor gives birth to twins Steffy and Phoebe Forrester, and suffers from tuberculosis during the pregnancy. Ridge's unstable high school ex Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton) becomes pregnant with his child in 2000, but the baby dies after Morgan falls off a balcony in Taylor's mansion. Morgan kidnaps Steffy during a family vacation and she is presumed dead. The truth is revealed and Morgan is jailed for her crimes, after kidnapping both Steffy and Taylor. In 2002, Taylor discovers that Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) who is criminally insane has broken out of jail. She tries to warn Eric, but instead is shot by Sheila while shielding Brooke. Taylor survives emergency surgery but dies in Ridge's arms due to heart failure.[13]\nIn 2005, Taylor re-appears at Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) and Nick Marone's (Jack Wagner) wedding ceremony and is soon revealed to be alive. She had been removed from the hospital by Prince Omar after her apparent death and was kept alive in a coma before waking up.[6] Taylor learns that Ridge is now married to Brooke and they share a son together. Ridge cannot decide between the two women, but after Stephanie fakes a heart attack and convinces him to choose Taylor, they renew their vows. Stephanie's lie is revealed; Taylor and Ridge work on their marriage, but after she kisses Hector Ramirez (Lorenzo Lamas) and confesses her infidelity with James years ago to Ridge, they divorce. Taylor becomes an alcoholic and while driving one night to Phoebe who is stranded on PCH, she accidentally hits Thorne's wife Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) with her car. Darla dies from her injuries. Taylor bonds with Thorne and his daughter Aly, and they become involved. Taylor confesses the truth about Darla's accident and is sent to prison but is later released due to her death being accidental. Thorne and Taylor break off their engagement and she begins a relationship with sailor Nick Marone (Jack Wagner); they marry and she becomes pregnant with his child through in vitro fertilization. However after the birth of their son Jack Marone, it is revealed through a lab mix up that Brooke's eggs were implanted in Taylor. After overcoming alcoholism and depression again, Taylor starts a romantic relationship with Brooke's son Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder). She divorces Nick and decides to hand Jack over to Brooke. Taylor leaves Rick due to her feelings for Ridge. In late 2008, Phoebe (MacKenzie Mauzy) is killed in a car accident, where Rick had been driving.\nWhen Rick becomes involved with Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) in 2009, Ridge experiences anxiety and sleeps with Taylor after consuming pills. Ridge leaves Brooke and nearly marries Taylor, but returns to Brooke shortly after. In 2010, Taylor marries Whipple Jones III (Rick Hearst). That year, she purchases 25% of Forrester Creations worth $50 million, and when Steffy is fired by Ridge, Taylor signs over these shares to her daughter.[14] In 2011, Whip and Taylor's marriage ends when he realizes she still loves Ridge. Stephanie and Thomas lie about Thomas sleeping with Brooke on an island they were stranded on.[15] As a result, Ridge and Taylor get back together and make it to the altar, but Stephanie confesses the truth, and Ridge reunites with Brooke. Taylor later begins romancing Thorne again, and exerts her power as trustee of Forrester Creations.[16][17] In 2012, Taylor counsels Brooke's sister Katie Logan Spencer (Heather Tom) who is suffering from postnatal depression.[18] Taylor says goodbye to best friend Stephanie before she dies from lung cancer. In 2013, Thomas loses out on the top position at Forrester Creations to Rick and wants to leave town; Taylor persuades Eric Forrester (John McCook) to help Thomas. Soon, Taylor and Eric become romantically involved and she moves into the Forrester mansion. Taylor discovers that Brooke slept with Katie's husband Bill Spencer Jr. (Don Diamont) which resulted in a pregnancy (and miscarriage). Taylor reveals Brooke's secret at her birthday party in front of everyone, and abruptly leaves town afterward. In 2014, Taylor is now living Paris and has reunited with Thorne. The couple return to Los Angeles, but Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), now a teenager, heavily disapproves.[19] Aly forgives Taylor for Darla's death and Taylor and Thorne return to Paris. After few months, Taylor returns to Los Angeles to visit some patients and tells Eric that she and Thorne broke up. Eric asks her to stay in Los Angeles, telling her that LA is the place where she has to live, but she refuses and returns to Paris. Before her leaving, Eric kisses Taylor on her cheek, still showing some feelings for her.\nIn April 2018, Taylor returns to Los Angeles, where she confronts Bill for taking advantage of Steffy and accuses him of displaying predatory behaviors. During the confrontation, Taylor confesses to shooting Bill and once again pulls a gun on him in a fit of emotional distress.\nShow creator William J. Bell introduced the role of psychiatrist Dr. Taylor Hamilton Hayes, played by actress Hunter Tylo, during the episode dated June 6, 1990.[20] According to Variety, Bell created Taylor as \"a romantic leading lady but also as a character who could facilitate social issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and directly partake in a few, too\".[21] Previously, Tylo was dismissed from two other soaps, All My Children and Days of Our Lives. The actress noted that her \"crazy sense of humor\" and \"funny business\" could have won her the role of Taylor, and she said: \"After the audition, they told me I was the only one right for the role. I think they liked my 'a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do' attitude.\"[22] Sherilyn Wolter temporarily replaced Tylo in 1990.[23] Tylo vacated the role in May 1994 to pursue other projects,[24] but the soap opera left the door open for her to return,[25] which she did months later. During her absence, the character was presumed to be dead.[26] In March 1996, following Taylor's decreased airtime and rumors circulating of her exit, it was confirmed that the actress was to leave The Bold and the Beautiful after her contract expired that June, to pursue a primetime role on the Fox television drama Melrose Place.[27] Taylor's final appearance was in May 1996.[28] However, in July 1996, Tylo was controversially fired from Melrose Place on the grounds of being pregnant and was replaced by Lisa Rinna. In response, she sued that show's executive producer Aaron Spelling and Spelling Productions for millions of US dollars, and won her case.[29] It was immediately reported that she would return to The Bold and the Beautiful, with head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell issuing the statement: \"I am certain that Hunter's talent and ability will continue to be an asset to the show.\"[28]\nIn October 2001, reports surfaced that Tylo was to exit the series again following unsuccessful contract negotiations,[30][31] although two months later in December she signed a new contract which gave her more flexibility to pursue other projects.[32] In October 2002, Bradley Bell killed off the character and Tylo's last appearance was on October 30, 2002.[33] In March 2004, she made a multiple-episode guest appearance as Taylor's ghost.[34] Following this, she told Soaps in Depth that \"I knew it my heart I would not be going back\", stating that she wanted to \"let the character go\". During her time off the show, she had turned down offers to appear on other soaps including As the World Turns.[35] In 2005, Deanna Barnert of Soap Opera Digest wrote that according to an industry insider, a character from the show \"may come back from the world of the beyond\", leading fans to speculate whether either Macy Alexander (Bobbie Eakes) or Taylor would be returning.[36] Taylor was revealed to be alive, with Tylo returning on-screen during the April 25, 2005 episode.[37] She was said to be \"having fun surprising her castmates\" with her reappearance on set.[36] The show's producers wanted to keep her on-screen return a secret, with Tylo wearing a wig when travelling to the set, and the character's name being changed on scripts.[36]\nIn May 2013, Tylo announced online that she was exiting the soap, possibly for good.[38] In a post on her website, she wrote: \"For me, contract talks ended 4 weeks ago. I am moving forward and opening back up to the thousands of acting roles available, writing, and persuing [sic] my skin care line. My friends and B&B fans will be sorely missed.\"[39] Tylo's final appearance aired on her birthday: July 3, 2013. Dan Kroll of the website Soap Central was shocked by her exit, though felt that a future return was possible, judging from her previous departures.[40] The news of Tylo's exit came just months after the high-profile departures of Ronn Moss and Susan Flannery from the series.[40] Tylo has since returned to The Bold and the Beautiful for a number of guest appearances. She made a one-episode appearance which aired on February 28, 2014.[41][42] The actress then made several guest appearances in April and May 2014, for a May sweeps story arc which revisited Taylor's accidental killing of Darla years earlier, with Darla's now teen daughter Aly (Ashlyn Pearce) struggling to deal with the issue of her mother's death.[43] Tylo appeared again on November 5, 12 and 24 2014.[44]\nTylo made a surprise return to The Bold and the Beautiful on April 12, 2018. Discussing her secret return to the set, she said: \"It was just so out of the blue (...) They had me hidden away...I had a code name...They kept it quiet from everybody.\"[45]\nTaylor is a globally renowned psychiatrist and works at the UCLA Medical Center.[3] When she debuted, the character emerged as the \"good girl\" alongside other female characters, but still had a strong demeanor.[46] Network Ten writes: \"This Freudian Doc always seems to lose out to Brooke when it comes to matters of the heart. Taylor is as sophisticated and intelligent as they come, always able to analyze the problems of others, and sometimes even her own.\"[47] The writers wanted Taylor to retain a \"pristine\" and \"well-mannered\" personality, according to Tylo, to contrast her from rival Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) who was \"feisty and reckless\", the different facets which attracted Ridge to each of them.[48] However, Tylo criticized a storyline in 2000 where Ridge is tricked into sleeping with his mentally unstable high school lover Morgan DeWitt (Sarah G. Buxton), who becomes pregnant with his child.[35] She said: \"I just wish that Taylor would get a clue, period! I wish that her psychiatric expertise would kick in already. I mean, she's retarded!\", also observing that the character can be absentminded.[49]\nIn the years following Taylor's 2005 return, her storylines changed significantly. After Ridge leaves Taylor, she becomes depressed and struggles with alcoholism. Tylo explained how this affected the character: \"The love of her life throws her away after she struggled so hard to come back to him. It was painful and humiliating. That made her more real and now, after everything she's been through, Taylor gets to be a little manipulative spiteful and even resentful.\"[48] Taylor, who is usually resilient, falls into a tailspin: accidentally killing Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) in a hit and run accident and lying about it, later being arrested for driving under the influence. Tylo confessed, \"These were the kinds of stories I was begging for\", as she thought \"it was very believable\".[48] The actress also wanted to portray Taylor as less \"serious\".[48]\nTaylor often loses out to Brooke, as Thorne (Ridge's brother) loses out to Ridge.[16] When asked in 2011 where she would like her storyline to go, Tylo said: \"I think we should see Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down.\"[16] In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally learning to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, \"In psychology, they tell you to be true to yourself. Maybe she is finally doing that, even though in her moral compass she knows that it is better to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much.\"[14]\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the character was off-screen, said to be living in Paris, where Tylo felt that she was \"declining\", noting: \"I think with all she\u2019s been through, she would probably have no choice but to deteriorate.\"[50] Reflecting on Taylor being revealed as Bill Spencer Jr.'s (Don Diamont) shooter, Tylo loved \"the idea of a crazy psychiatrist\", \"I\u2019ve always said that Taylor is the good doc who can\u2019t take her medicine; that\u2019s how I\u2019ve always described her, and this story just gives her so many things to do.\"[50]\nTaylor's major love interest is Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss). The couple faces challenges at first, such as interference from their respective exes, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Blake Hayes (Peter Brown),[52] and Ridge's mother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery), initially disliking Taylor.[53] By July 1991, John Goudas of The Gadsden Times wrote that Taylor was \"hooked\" by Ridge but was \"no-nonsense\". Taylor refuses to marry Ridge unless he was serious about the end of his relationship with Brooke; Goudas noted that Taylor wanted \"insurance\" and deemed her \"upfront\" approach as the \"polar opposite\" to that of Brooke.[46] Ridge and Taylor ultimately marry in 1992. The actors were under pressure during the shooting of the wedding as it was filmed on the day of the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.[51]\nThe love triangle between Taylor, Ridge and Brooke continued into Ridge and Taylor's first marriage. When Brooke has Ridge's child, Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones), Taylor helps raise the baby[22] (although it was later revealed in 1996 that Bridget was fathered by Ridge's father Eric, not him).[54][55] Speaking on Ridge's decision to remain married to Taylor, Tylo said that the actors were \"so sick of this triangle\" and revealed: \"One of the things Bradley's going to do is have Ridge pick Taylor over Brooke. For a change, instead of women breaking couples up or getting pregnant to trap a man, we're going to see how couples work through their problems.\"[22] After Taylor is presumed dead in a plane crash in 1994 only to return months later, Tylo felt that Taylor would be feeling \"quite cheated\" by Ridge marrying Brooke, and joked that \"Taylor wasn't even cold yet\".[25] Ridge and Taylor divorce, although soon become involved once more, and get back together when Ridge finds out that he fathered Taylor's son, Thomas Forrester (Adam Gregory).[56] Ridge and Taylor remarry on June 24, 1998.[57]\nDespite Ridge and Taylor's remarriage, Brooke continues her attempts at winning Ridge back. Stephanie encourages Taylor to see Brooke's intent, with Tylo observing: \"It was so obvious she was going after Ridge. How can you explain away that she always kept ending up in the elevator in her bra and underwear over and over again? Stephanie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole mission was to get Taylor to smell the coffee and [realize] that not everybody has as altruistic an agenda as she does.\"[14] Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie (\"Steffy\") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting with a man who has it.[58][59] Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies.[60][61][62] Tylo said that this was \"a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women\".[21] When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the \"horrible reality\", saying: \"He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go of this woman who he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with.\" Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate.[63] Taylor's \"ghost\" visits Ridge in 2004 and encourages him to be with Brooke.[64] Following Taylor's return to the show, her marriage to Ridge fell apart in 2006 and they divorce. They have since reunited on several occasions but he continues going back to Brooke, despite Taylor's efforts to thwart this from happening.[65][66] Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens noted that Steffy and Thomas \"grew up watching their daddy basically climb out of their mom's bed and right into the sack with Rick (Jacob Young) and Hope's (Kimberly Matula) mom, over and over again.\"[67]\nTaylor has been romantically linked to Ridge's half-brother Thorne (Winsor Harmon) multiple times. They were briefly involved from 1997 to 1998, when Ridge is in jail and urges Taylor to forget about him.[68] Taylor also briefly lies about Thorne being Thomas' father.[69][70] After accidentally killing Thorne's wife Darla in 2006, Taylor falls in love with Thorne, who is \"forgiving and loving\" towards her, even helping her attend AA. They nearly marry, but split up due to his then 4-year-old daughter Alexandria Forrester learning that Taylor killed Darla.[48] Of working with Tylo, Harmon said, \"I am so comfortable with Hunter. We have that [comfort] around each other, and when that happens as an artist, you are allowed to open up more and there is more spontaneity.\"[16]\nThorne and Taylor later become involved again in 2011, when they team up against the Forresters for mistreating them. Tylo said: \"[Taylor] probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to have a shot at Forrester in the driver\u2019s seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge.\"[16] However, Tylo saw that there was a \"sticky point\" between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor \"would do anything to make up for that\".[16] The actress said, \"I think it\u2019s very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. So I think the audience can appreciate it and go, 'Wow. I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn\u2019t look forced.\"[16]\nIn 2008, Taylor becomes involved with Brooke's son, the much younger Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder), who was previously in a relationship with Phoebe. Lowder described playing the storyline as \"challenging\" and one that \"stirs the pot\". It began after Tylo and Lowder were tested for chemistry in scenes.[71] When the news of Rick and Taylor becoming closer reaches Brooke and Ridge, they both protest against it; Tylo described this as \"two pots calling the kettle black\". Brooke accuses Taylor of being with Rick as a form of revenge against her, and enlists Phoebe's help in stopping the relationship. Tylo told Soap Opera Digest that Taylor's revenge is \"a subconscious thing\", explaining: \"Taylor sort of feels like Brooke stole her child, so this is kind of retribution. Taylor is like, 'Well then I'll take your kid'.\" Phoebe accepts Rick and Taylor being together, wanting both of them to be happy and giving Taylor the \"green light she was looking for\".[72] Lowder believed that the tables were turning on Brooke, and said \"now Brooke's son is in love with [Taylor], and she's in love with him \u2013 and it's legit (...) Taylor wins, Brooke loses \u2013 and Brooke's going crazy\".[73] Rick and Taylor get engaged[74] but she ends the relationship due to her feelings for Ridge.[66]\nTaylor becomes involved with Whipple \"Whip\" Jones III (Rick Hearst) through internet dating, in 2009. Tommy Garret of Canyon News said that Whip and Taylor's \"chemistry is magnificent\".[75] Whip was previously involved with Brooke; Garret wrote: \"Now he's in love with Brooke's mortal enemy Taylor Hayes Forrester... Hearst is magnificently suited for the role and fans want to see Whip and Taylor find happiness. At least for a few months.\"[75] Of their romance, Tylo said: \"I think Taylor has found true love with Whip. I think if she was a smart psychiatrist, and able to apply her knowledge in her own world, she would be with Whip. She would know this is a healthy relationship. But Taylor doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it. She still wants to fix people.\"[14] Taylor and Whip marry in April 2010.[76] Whip becomes jealous when Taylor admits to Stephanie that she still has feelings for Ridge.[77] Whip's frustration with Taylor's feelings for Ridge leads to the demise of their relationship the following year, and they end the marriage.[78]\nBeginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor would fight over Ridge's affection for years.[79] In 2013, Tylo revealed that she and Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: \"We cannot look comfortable with each other. We need to look like we are in a place of competition.\"[80] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were \"crossing swords once again for the same man\". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with \"more intelligence\" this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as \"long as it wasn't over Ridge\" again.[48] Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke.[81] Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: \"I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'\" The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the \"feeling that will never go away which is, 'It's not fair'\".[82] Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation.[74] However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.[3]\nIn 2010, Lang and Tylo recreated a 1983 lily pond cat-fight between Krystle Carrington and Alexis Colby in the drama Dynasty, shooting the scenes in a koi pond at the CBS Studios.[83] Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said the \"two Mrs. Ridge Forresters\" had escalated to \"all out war\".[83] After Stephanie's death, Taylor and Brooke's animosity against one another reignites as Taylor grows closer to Eric in 2013. Tylo said that \"When Brooke and Taylor go at it, it really gets a lot of people wound up. I said this brings the show around full circle with everything Stephanie was fighting for, and now the battle has been set for these two to really go at it.\"[79]\nTylo explaining why her character was killed off (2004)[35]\nIn October 2002, it was announced that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: \"It is with great sadness I have to tell you that Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other paths\u2014in a word, played out.\"[33] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: \"I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere.\"[35] Tylo said that \"It just seemed like everything had to do with whether or not there was a woman after her husband\" and that she was \"done with it\", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show.[35] Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a \"brick wall\", but Bell was \"afraid to go beyond that\" and have the character go \"off the deep end\", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that \"in reality that's what she needed \u2013 to be more human. But she just got boring instead\".[48] Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.[57][84]\nAfter three years in the role, Tylo had become a fan favorite with viewers.[25] Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune noted that she fit in well with the show's \"signature glamor casting\".[22] Discussing Tylo's 1994 temporary exit, Kathleen Sloan of the Toronto Star observed that \"fans of the soap couldn't have been more open-mouthed\" over the matter.[85] In 2004, Soaps In Depth called Taylor \"daytime's sexiest shrink\".[86] Tommy Garret of Canyon News described Taylor as being the \"epitome of grace and dignity\".[87] The character appeared on the Spartanburg Herald-Journal in an article titled \"Stars with 9 Lives: Death is Not Forever in Soaps\" after her airplane crash in 1994 resulted in her assumed death.[88] Debashine Thangevelo of Independent Online observed, \"Tylo is an actress who wields as much influence in the world of soaps as Taylor Hayes in The Bold and the Beautiful. Having inhabited this role for almost two decades, barring a sabbatical, she has made an indelible impression on viewers.\"[14] Chris Eades of CBS Soaps In Depth noted that \"Fans were absolutely stunned\" by the \"all-too-rare surprise\" of Taylor's 2018 return, writing: \"With Steffy in desperate need of support, it was the perfect time for Taylor to return to town and offer her daughter some help.\"[89] Reacting to Taylor being revealed as Bill's shooter, Canyon News wrote: \"Tylo delivered some riveting scenes, as a mother concerned about her daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-being\", stating that her return \"causes all types of problems which make for interesting TV\".[90]\nFor her portrayal of Taylor, Tylo was nominated for \"Favorite Hottest Female Star\" at the 1995 Soap Opera Digest Awards, however Kristina Wagner of General Hospital won.[91] Tylo was nominated for the same award at the 1999 Soap Opera Digest Awards (Days Of Our Lives star Kristian Alfonso won that year).[92] The actress received a Telvis Award for Foreign Female TV Performer (Finnish: Ulkomainen naisesiintyj\u00c3\u00a4) in 2002 for the role.[93]\nDaily Mail described the Brooke, Ridge and Taylor love triangle as \"epic\".[94] Widely famed, the triangle was seen by Soap Opera Digest as one of the genre's greatest during the early 1990s.[95] In 1991, John Goudas of The Gadsden Times felt that \"So far, Taylor has viewer sympathy\" in the triangle, but also wrote: \"we don't see Dr. Taylor Hayes do much practicing, or ever see her making hospital rounds. Air time means time with Ridge or with ex-husband Blake. So much for medicine.\"[46] In 2008, Darren Lomas from Daytime Confidential noted that the \"Taylor and Brooke wars have lasted for two decades. Even when Taylor was taking a dirt nap, fan messageboards still buzzed with Taylor and Brooke fans taking swipes at each other.\" [3] Tommy Garrett recognized Brooke and Taylor the queen of soap opera cat-fights[83] and noted that \"at least half of the show's fans\" had supported Taylor in the love triangle.[4]\nRidge and Taylor are considered a soap opera supercouple[96][33] and are referred to by the portmanteau \"Tridge\" on social media.[97][98] Speaking on the beginning of the relationship, Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, \"Taylor was Caroline's doctor, which made her affair with Ridge, as the bleep bleep machine was flatlining, slightly inappropriate. But then, nothing in daytime soap opera is ever appropriate.\"[84] Their 1992 wedding was ranked at number 18 by The Huffington Post on a list of the \"Top 20 Most Memorable Soap Weddings of All Time\".[51] Michael Fairman referred to Taylor and Thorne as \"the screwed-over couple of B&B\".[16]",

        "text": "13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as Th1rteen R3asons Why) is an American mystery teen drama web television series based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher and adapted by Brian Yorkey for Netflix. The series revolves around a high school student, Clay Jensen, and his friend Hannah Baker, a girl who committed suicide after suffering a series of demoralizing circumstances brought on by select individuals at her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah before her suicide details thirteen reasons why she ended her life.\nDiana Son and Brian Yorkey serve as showrunners on the series. The first season consists of thirteen episodes.[2] The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television. Originally conceived as a film set to be released by Universal Pictures with Selena Gomez in the role of Hannah Baker, the adaptation was picked up as a television series by Netflix in late 2015. Gomez serves as an executive producer. The first season, and the special 13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons, were released worldwide on Netflix on March 31, 2017.\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences, who have praised its subject matter and casting, particularly the two leads, Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford. It has attracted controversy from some, including mental health professionals, over the series' graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content. In May 2017, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, scheduled to premiere in 2018.[3]\nTeenager Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box lying on his porch. Inside, he discovers seven double-sided cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his classmate and unrequited love, who tragically committed suicide two weeks earlier. On tape, Hannah unfolds an emotional audio diary, detailing the thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Her instructions are clear: each person who receives the package is one of the reasons why she killed herself. And after each person has completed listening to the tapes, they must pass the package on to the next person. If anyone decides to break the chain, a separate set of tapes will be released to the public. Each tape is addressed to a select person in her school and details their involvement in her eventual suicide.\nClay Jensen finds a box filled with audio cassette tapes anonymously left on his front doorstep. He plays the first in his father's boombox and realizes they have been recorded by his recently deceased classmate Hannah Baker, before he accidentally drops and breaks the boombox when surprised by his mother. Clay steals his friend Tony's Walkman to continue listening. Clay listens to the first tape, in which Hannah begins to relate the experiences that led to her suicide. She starts by sharing the story of her first kiss, with Justin Foley, who goes on to inadvertently spread a salacious rumor that begins the sequence of events leading to her suicide. Clay is revealed, through numerous short flashbacks, to have been in love with Hannah and to have worked with her at the local movie theater.\nHannah reminisces about her friendship with two other new students: Jessica, who moves frequently because her father is in the Air Force, and Alex, who they met at a coffee shop. Jessica and Alex eventually begin a relationship and stop spending time with Hannah. When Alex breaks up with Jessica, she very publicly blames Hannah. In the present, Hannah's mother, Olivia, finds a note in her daughter's textbook that leads her to believe Hannah was being bullied. Clay asks Jessica about the tapes, which results in Bryce Walker's circle of peers meeting to discuss how Clay is listening to Hannah's recordings.\nAs Clay attempts to pursue a romantic relationship with Hannah, her relationships are threatened by a \"best/worst list\" made by Alex Standall, who has put a \"target\" on Hannah. In the present, Hannah's mother, Olivia Baker, seeks out the school principal about her suspicion of bullying and makes a disturbing discovery. In the midst of his investigation, Clay turns to Alex for answers, who not only feels regret for his actions on the tapes, but also warns Clay against trusting Tony, whom Clay later sees in a violent exchange with his brothers. As Justin tries to recuperate from his recent slump, Bryce strong-arms Clay and Alex into a drinking contest in an alleyway.\nHannah hears someone outside her window, and confesses to her friend, Courtney, that she has a stalker. Courtney offers to help her catch the offender in the act. While waiting for the stalker to arrive, they play an alcohol-fueled game of truth or dare which leads to the two of them kissing on Hannah's bed. The stalker, school photographer Tyler Down, takes a photo of the girls and sends it around the school. This effectively ends Courtney and Hannah's friendship as Courtney distances herself from Hannah to avoid being revealed as one of the people in the photograph. In the present, Clay goes to Hannah's house and talks to her mother, though is unable to admit how close he and Hannah were. He also confronts Tony about the incident with his brothers. Tony responds that \"people have to make their own justice\" and proves he has an extra set of tapes. Inspired by this, Clay takes a naked picture of Tyler and sends it around the school in revenge.\nCourtney, afraid of her classmates finding out about her sexuality, spreads a rumor that the girls in the leaked photos are Hannah and Laura, an openly lesbian classmate. Courtney also adds to the rumor about Hannah and Justin, worsening Hannah's poor reputation. In the present, Clay takes Courtney to visit Hannah's grave. She leaves, not ready to face her involvement in the loss of her classmate or be more open about her sexuality. Tony arrives with Clay's bike and gives him a tape with the song he and Hannah danced to at the Winter Formal. Later, Justin, Zach and Alex force Clay into the car with them by stealing his bike and scare him into silence about the tapes by driving over the speed limit. They are pulled over by the police but face no consequences as the officer is revealed to be Alex's father. Clay denies knowing Hannah to his mother, who has been asked to represent the school in the lawsuit the Bakers are bringing.\nHannah's date on Valentine's Day with Marcus does not go as planned due to the rumors that she is \"easy\". In the present, Alex gets into a fight with Montgomery and they both have to appear before the student council. Clay helps Sheri on an assignment, and they nearly hook up, but Sheri reveals she is only there because she is on the tapes and wants Clay to like her despite her role in Hannah's death.\nAfter Hannah refuses to go out with Zach, he gets revenge by sabotaging her emotionally during a class project. In the present, Clay hears Zach's tape and keys his car in an act of revenge, but things turn out to be different than they appeared. Clay is now having both auditory and visual hallucinations of Hannah during the day, including seeing her dead body on the floor of the basketball court during a game and hearing her tape playing over the school's intercom system. He returns the tapes to Tony, unable to continue listening.\nHannah is touched by poetry recited by fellow student Ryan Shaver, and joins the Evergreen Poetry Club, a place where people write and perform their own poetry, and listen and critique others. Hannah presents some extremely revealing and confessional poetry at the poetry club after Ryan encourages her. Ryan betrays her by publishing the poem without her knowledge or consent in his school magazine. Almost everyone in school finds the poem hilarious, but Clay is both touched and disturbed by it, not realizing Hannah is the author. In the present day, Tony confides to Clay about the night of Hannah's death, and Clay takes back the tapes. Clay later gives the poem to Hannah's mother.\nWhile hiding in Jessica's room during a party, Hannah witnesses Bryce Walker raping an unconscious and intoxicated Jessica. In the present, Marcus warns Clay the worst is yet to come and again attempts to scare him into silence about the tapes, this time by planting drugs in his backpack to get him suspended from school. Clay finally admits to his mother that he and Hannah were close. After getting suspicious legal advice from his mother, he goes to Justin's apartment to retrieve his bike and talk about getting justice for Jessica. Justin finally admits that what happened in the tapes is real, and claims it is better if Jessica does not know the truth.\nAfter the party, Hannah gets a ride home from her classmate, cheerleader Sheri Holland. They have what appears to be a minor accident, knocking over a stop sign. While Hannah wants to call the police to report it, Sheri refuses to do so, because she is afraid she will get in trouble. While Hannah is on her way to find a phone to call the authorities, the downed stop sign causes a serious accident at that intersection, resulting in the death of Clay's friend Jeff Atkins, which was incorrectly considered a drunk driving accident. When Hannah tries to tell Clay about the stop sign, he pushes her away, thinking she is being unnecessarily dramatic. In the present, Jessica's behavior becomes more erratic. Clay finds out that Sheri is trying to make up for her mistake in her own way, and he tells Jeff's parents that Jeff was sober when he died.\nWith Tony's support, Clay finally listens to his tape and is overcome with guilt to the point of contemplating his own suicide because he feels he did not do enough to prevent Hannah's death. Tony manages to calm him down. Justin finds out Jessica is at Bryce's home. He confronts her there and admits that Bryce raped her on the night of the party, causing her to break up with him. Olivia Baker finds a list with the names of all the people on the tapes, although she does not know what the list means.\nAfter accidentally losing her parents' store's earnings, a depressed Hannah stumbles upon a party being thrown by Bryce. The night ends in tragedy when she ends up alone with him, and he rapes her in his hot tub. This leads Hannah to create a list of people (the one that her mother found in the previous episode) who she feels were responsible for leading her to her current circumstances, which becomes the inspiration for the creation of the tapes. In the present, everyone on Hannah's list is subpoenaed to testify in the lawsuit between the Bakers and the school. The subjects of the tapes disagree over what to do. Tyler eventually suggests they pin everything on Bryce, but Alex refuses and says they should tell the truth. Sheri turns herself in. Clay goes to Bryce's house, on the pretext of buying marijuana, to confront him about the events of the night he raped Hannah. Clay provokes Bryce to attack him and is badly beaten. However, Clay has been secretly recording their conversation and gets Bryce to admit that he raped Hannah. An unknown teenager with a gunshot wound to the head is treated by paramedics.\nHannah begins to record the tapes and then visits Mr. Porter to tell him about her rape. Hannah secretly records the conversation, hoping he will help her. When he does not, she heads home and commits suicide by cutting her wrists and arms in a bathtub filled with water. In the present, Clay gives Tony the tape of his conversation with Bryce to copy. He confronts Mr. Porter about meeting with Hannah on her last day. He also hands over the tapes, including the additional tape containing Bryce's confession. Clay tells Porter that he is the subject of the final tape. The depositions begin, Marcus and Courtney deny their involvement in Hannah's death as much as possible. Zach and Jessica admit their mistakes. Before his deposition, Tyler hides ammunition and guns in his room, and then reveals the existence of the tapes during his interview. Alex is revealed to have been the teenager with the gunshot wound; he is in critical condition at the hospital. Justin leaves town out of guilt, but not before telling Bryce about the tapes. Jessica finally tells her father about her rape. At school, Clay reaches out to Skye Miller, his former friend, to avoid repeating the same mistakes he made with Hannah.\nUniversal Studios purchased film rights to the novel on February 8, 2011, with Selena Gomez cast to play Hannah Baker.[10] On October 29, 2015, it was announced that Netflix would be making a television adaptation of the book with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer.[11] Tom McCarthy was hired to direct the first two episodes.[12] The series is produced by Anonymous Content and Paramount Television with Gomez, McCarthy, Joy Gorman, Michael Sugar, Steve Golin, Mandy Teefey, and Kristel Laiblin serving as executive producers.[12]\nFilming for the show took place in the Northern Californian towns of Vallejo, Benicia, San Rafael, Crockett and Sebastopol during the summer of 2016.[13][14] The first season and the special were released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.[15]\nTherapy dogs were present on set for the actors because of the intense and emotional content of the series.[16]\nOn May 7, 2017, it was announced that Netflix had renewed the series for a second season. A short promo was released on various 13 Reasons Why social media accounts.[17] Filming for the second season began on June 12, 2017,[18] but was briefly halted in October in response to the then-ongoing California wildfires happening around the areas where the series was being filmed.[19]\nThe marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the second-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 48% of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. The series also showed an 18% increase in week-over-week viewership from week one to week two. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.[20]\nThe show has received positive reviews from critics, with much of the praise for the show has been directed at the cast's performances, direction, story, visuals, improvements upon its source material, and mature approach to dark and adult subject matter.\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 82% approval rating with an average rating of 7.3/10 based on 42 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"13 Reasons Why complements its bestselling source material with a gripping look at adolescent grief whose narrative maturity belies its YA milieu.\"[21] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[22]\nJesse Schedeen of IGN praised 13 Reasons Why, giving it a 9.2 out of 10, \"Amazing\", stating that the show is \"a very powerful and hard-hitting series\" and \"ranks among the best high school dramas of the 21st century\".[23] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave a glowing review for the show, saying that \"the drama is sensitive, consistently engaging, and, most importantly, unblinking\".[24] Maureen Ryan of Variety asserts that the show \"is undoubtedly sincere, but it's also, in many important ways, creatively successful\" and called it \"simply essential viewing\".[25] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the entire season a score of B+, calling the show \"a frank, authentically affecting portrait of what it feels like to be young, lost and too fragile for the world\".[26] Daniel Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the show, calling it \"an honorably mature piece of young-adult adaptation\", calling its performances, direction, relevance and maturity as some of the show's strongest points.[27]\nThe cast's performances, particularly Katherine Langford as Hannah and Dylan Minnette as Clay, were frequently mentioned and widely lauded in several reviews. Schedeen of IGN praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford's performances, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"[23] Gilbert of The Boston Globe praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another.\" Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"[27]\nRyan of Variety also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, whom Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".[25] Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire, who enjoyed the show and gave it a glowing score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and complex diversity of its supporting cast of teens.[25][23][27][28]\nAnother aspect frequently mentioned within several reviews was the show's mature and emotional approach to dark and adult subject matter depicted in the show. This was positively reviewed by critics, such as Miller of Indiewire, who gave it a positive review of the season, particularly her mentions that \"the adult edges to this story ring with honesty and truth\", but also states that this makes the show difficult to watch at times.[28] Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also states that the show is very difficult to watch at times,[27] while Schedeen of IGN states that the show is \"an often depressing and even uncomfortable show to watch... a pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the pieces really start to fall into place.\"[23]\nNumerous critics also praised several aspects of the show. Feinberg praised the show's directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",[28] while Gilbert of The Boston Globe praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"[24]\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"[29]\nWriting for The Guardian, Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the show, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me.\" Nicholson was skeptical that the show would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life: \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that note is horrifying. 'It has to get better,' implores one student towards the end, but given its fairly open ending, an apparent season two setup, it does not seem as if there's much chance of that happening.\"[30]\nWashington Post television critic Hank Stuever wrote a negative review, finding 13 Reasons Why \"contrived\" and implausible: \"There are 13 episodes lasting 13 super-sullen hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a passive-aggressive, implausibly meandering, poorly written and awkwardly acted effort that is mainly about miscommunication, delivering no more wisdom or insight about depression, bullying and suicide than one of those old ABC Afterschool Specials people now mock for being so corny.\" He also wrote that he found Hannah's suicide tapes \"a protracted example of the teenager who fantasizes how everyone will react when she's gone. The story ... strikes me as remarkably, even dangerously, naive in its understanding of suicide, up to and including a gruesome, penultimate scene of Hannah opening her wrists in a bathtub.\"[31]\nDavid Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the series a tepid review, saying that it was plagued by character inconsistencies, particularly Hannah. He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids. At other times, though, relatively minor misperceived slights seem to send her into an emotional tailspin. No doubt, teenagers embody a constant whirl of conflicting emotions, but the script pushes the bounds of credibility here and there.\" He noted that overall, the series worked: \"The structure is gimmicky and the characters inconsistent, but there are still at least 13 Reasons Why the series is worthy.\"[32]\nThe series has generated controversy over its portrayal of suicide and self-harm, causing Netflix to add strong advisory warnings prior to the first episode. School psychologists and educators have raised alarm about the series. The superintendent of Palm Beach County, Florida schools, reportedly told parents that their schools had seen an increase in suicidal and self-harm behavior from students, and that some of those students \"have articulated associations of their at-risk behavior to the 13 Reasons Why Netflix series.\"[33]\nThe Australian youth mental health service for 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 year-olds, Headspace, issued a warning in late April 2017 over the graphic content featured in the series due to the increased number of calls to the service following the show's release in the country.[34][35][36]\nIn response to the graphic nature of the show and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34[a] OECD countries during 2009 to 2012,[38][39] the Office of Film & Literature Classification in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian.[40][41]\nIn response to the controversy, Gomez, one of the executive producers on 13 Reasons Why, defended the series. She stated: \"We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do,\" Gomez told Associated Press. \"We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.\"[42]\nIn April 2017, National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) released a statement regarding the series, saying: \"Research shows that exposure to another person's suicide, or to graphic or sensationalized accounts of death, can be one of the many risk factors that youth struggling with mental health conditions cite as a reason they contemplate or attempt suicide.\"[43] The NASP sent a letter to school mental health professionals across the country about the series, reportedly a first for the NASP in response to a television show.[44]\nIn May 2017, the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (SCCAP) released a statement also noting how strongly the show may serve as a trigger for self-injury among vulnerable youth and lamented the depiction of mental health professionals as ineffective for youth who have experienced trauma and may have been considering suicide.[45] The statement implored Netflix to add a tag following each episode with mental health resources and a reminder that depression and suicide can be effectively treated by a qualified mental health professional such as a clinical child psychologist using evidence-based practice.\nSimilarly, clinical psychologists such as Daniel J. Reidenberg and Erika Martinez, as well as mental health advocate MollyKate Cline of Teen Vogue magazine, have expressed concerns regarding the risk of suicide contagion.[46][47][48] However, Eric Beeson, a counselor at The Family Institute at Northwestern University noted that \"it's unlikely that one show alone could trigger someone to attempt suicide\".[43]\nMental health professionals have also criticized the series' depiction of suicide itself, much of which violates widely promulgated recommendations for reporting on actual suicides or depicting them in fiction in order to not encourage copycat suicides.[49] The season finale, which depicts Hannah's suicide in graphic detail, has been particularly criticized in this regard.[50] Nic Sheff, a writer for the show, has defended it as intended to dispel the myth that suicides \"quietly drift off\", and recalled how he himself was deterred from a suicide attempt by recalling a survivor's account of how painful and horrifying it was.[51]\nThe NASP statement also criticizes the show's suggestion that bullying alone led Hannah to take her life, noting that while it may be a contributing factor, suicidal ideations far more often result from the bullied person having a treatable mental illness without adequate coping mechanisms. Alex Moen, a school counselor in Minneapolis, took issue with the show's entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain ... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"[50]\nOther counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told Slate.[50]\nIn May 2017, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement of similar concerns to the ones raised by the NASP. The CMHA is concerned that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, and, particularly, in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the American Association of Suicidology. While the CMHA and CASP praised the show for raising awareness about \"this preventable health concern\", they added that: \"raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to the CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"[52][53]\nOne study found the release of 13 Reasons Why corresponded with between 900,000 and 1,500,000 more suicide related searches in the United States, including a 26% increase in searches for \"how to commit suicide\", an 18% increase for \"commit suicide\" and a 9% increase for \"how to kill yourself\".[54] A review, however, found that it is unclear if searching for information about suicide on the Internet relates to the risk of suicide.[55]",

        "text": "Wake Forest is a town in Franklin and Wake counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina; located almost entirely in Wake County, it lies just north of the state capital, Raleigh. The population was 30,117 at the 2010 census,[5] up from 12,588 at the 2000 census. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the city's population to be 34,752 as of July 1, 2013.[6] In 2007, the town was listed by Forbes magazine as the 20th fastest growing suburb in America, with a 73.2 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2006.[7][8] Wake Forest was the original home of Wake Forest University for 122 years before it moved to Winston-Salem in 1956.\nThe US Office of Management and Budget also includes Wake Forest as a part of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area, which has a population of 1,998,808 as of U.S. Census 2012 Population Estimates.[9] Effective June 6, 2003 the Office of Management and Budget redefined the Federal Statistical Areas and dismantled what had been for decades the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, MSA and split them into two separate MSAs even though the region still functions as a single metropolitan area.\nIn 1832,[10] Dr. Calvin Jones, originally from New England, bought 615 acres (2.49\u00c2\u00a0km2) of forested land in Wake County, North Carolina. The sparsely populated area became known as the Forest of Wake, or Wake Forest. Jones sold his farm to the North Carolina Baptist Convention for $2,000, who opened the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, later Wake Forest College, on the site. The Raleigh & Gaston Railroad, completed in 1840, established a depot in nearby Forestville that stimulated the school and surrounding village. College leaders convinced the railroad to move the depot even closer to the college in 1874, leading to more economic development. This community was incorporated as the \"Town of Wake Forest College\" in 1880. In 1909, the word \"College\" was removed from the name of the town. The college moved to the much larger city of Winston-Salem in 1956.[11] Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary began offering classes on the original campus of Wake Forest University in 1950, and occupied the entire campus when the university completed its move.\nWake Forest operates under the Council-Manager form of government. The citizens elect a Mayor and Board of Commissioners as the town's governing body. The Town Manager is appointed by the Board to serve as the chief operating officer administering all municipal affairs.[12][13] The current mayor is Vivian A. Jones (term expires 2017), and current council members include Greg Harrington (2019), Brian Pate (2019), Anne Reeve (2019), Margaret Stinnett (2017), and Jim Thompson (2017).[14]\nA new town hall facility opened in downtown Wake Forest in September 2010,[15] and was LEED Platinum certified in November 2011.[16] All town departments are housed in the facility, except police (which has its own building nearby) and public works.\nWake Forest is located at 35\u00b058\u203224\u2033N 78\u00b031\u20328\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.97333\u00b0N 78.51889\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.97333; -78.51889 (35.973289, -78.518789).[17]\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 15.2 square miles (39.4\u00a0km2). 15.1 square miles (39.1\u00a0km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3\u00a0km2) of it (0.80%) is water.[18]\nWake Forest is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the North American Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. Its central Piedmont location situates Wake Forest about three hours by car west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nWake Forest enjoys a moderate subtropical climate, with moderate temperatures in the spring, fall, and winter. Summers are typically hot with high humidity. Winter highs generally range in the low 50s \u00b0F (10 to 13 \u00b0C) with lows in the low-to-mid 30s \u00b0F (-2 to 2\u00a0\u00b0C), although an occasional 60\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C) or warmer winter day is not uncommon. Spring and fall days usually reach the low-to-mid 70s \u00b0F (low 20s \u00b0C), with lows at night in the lower 50s \u00b0F (10 to 14\u00a0\u00b0C). Summer daytime highs often reach the upper 80s to low 90s \u00b0F (29 to 35\u00a0\u00b0C). The rainiest months are July and August.\nAs of the 2000 census,[3] there were 12,588 people, 4,617 households, and 3,407 families residing in Wake Forest. The population density was 1,614.4 inhabitants per square mile (623.1/km\u00b2). There were 5,091 housing units at an average density of 652.9 per square mile (252.0/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the town was 79.63% White, 15.78% African American, 0.21% Native American, 2.03% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.78% from other races, and 1.56% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.08% of the population.\nThere were 4,617 households out of which 41.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.3% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.2% were non-families. 20.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.11.\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 29.7% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 39.3% from 25 to 44, 15.8% from 45 to 64, and 7.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females there were 91.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $52,307, and the median income for a family was $60,408. Males had a median income of $45,630 versus $30,205 for females. The per capita income for the town was $22,746. About 6.3% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.7% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.\nThe town is served by nine public schools which are administered by the Wake County Public School System. Public schools include:\nCharter schools include Franklin Academy (K-12), Endeavor Charter School (K-8), and Envision Science Academy (K-8). Private schools include Thales Academy, All Saints Academy, and Saint Catherine of Siena Catholic School, serving grades K-8.[19] Wake Forest is also home to two Montessori schools, Wake Forest Montessori[20] and Montessori Children's House of Wake Forest.\nWake Technical Community College [21] is an area two-year college with a north campus on Louisburg Road in Raleigh. Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary is a seminary of the Southern Baptist Convention. It began offering classes in 1950 on the original campus of Wake Forest University and is commonly known by its acronym, SEBTS.\nThe DuBois Center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[22] The W. E. B. DuBois School opened in 1926 for the African-American community in Wake Forest before racial segregation ceased in 1971. After the school outgrew the facility and moved to a new location, the building was vacant for a decade until the DuBois Alumni Association purchased the building and made it into a community center.[23]\nOther listings in or near Wake Forest on the National Register of Historic Places are the Bailey-Estes House, Downtown Wake Forest Historic District, Glen Royall Mill Village Historic District, Lea Laboratory, Oakforest, Powell House, Purefoy-Chappell House and Outbuildings, Purefoy-Dunn Plantation, Rock Cliff Farm, Royall Cotton Mill Commissary, South Brick House, Thompson House, Wake Forest Historic District, Wakefield Dairy Complex, and Wakefields.[24][25][26]\nWake Forest Historical Museum, also known as the Calvin Jones Historical House, was built in 1820 and was the residence of the first president of Wake Forest College and the center of activities that took place at the school. The museum displays the history of the town of Wake Forest as well as Wake Forest University. The house contains collections of photos, books, college publications, furniture, documents, professors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 writings, and medical, law and sports memorabilia.[27]\nThe Wake County Public Library System operates a branch in Wake Forest.[28]\nWake Forest is home to the Falls Lake State Recreation Area. Falls Lake Park contains the 12,000-acre (49\u00a0km2) Falls Lake and 26,000 acres (110\u00a0km2) of woodlands.[29]\nWake Forest is served by ten parks and community centers.

        "text": "Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) is a pathogenic plant virus[1] in the genus Potyvirus and the virus family Potyviridae which primarily infects the papaya tree.\nThe virus is a non-enveloped, flexous rod-shaped particle that is between 760\u2013800\u00a0nm long and 12\u00a0nm in diameter. It is transmitted between plants by mechanical activities like pruning and by numerous aphid species such as Myzus persicae. No seed transmission has been detected.[2]\nThere are two major types of this virus that are serologically indistinguishable and are so closely genetically related that they are now considered the same virus species. The type that gave the virus its name are the Type P isolates (PRSV-P). This type infects papaya and several members of the melon family (Cucurbitaceae). The other type, Type W isolates (PRSV-W), does not infect papaya. Isolates of PRSV-W do infect cucurbits such as watermelon, cucumber, and squash and were originally known as Watermelon mosaic virus 1.[3][4]\nHawaiian papaya production has been severely affected twice by PRSV. The virus was introduced to Oahu as early as 1937.[5] The disease was mild for a number of years until it either mutated or a more aggressive strain was introduced around 1950. Within 12 years, the amount of land under papaya production dropped 94%. Production was then moved from Oahu to the Puna region of Hawaii island (the \"Big Island\") under strict quarantine. In 1971 PRSV was found in home gardens but efforts were taken to prevent its spread. The virus emerged in commercial farms in 1992 and by 1995 production in Puna was impossible. Commercial growers again relocated to the Hamakua coast but with only limited success. Hawaiian papaya production was halved by the end of the decade. Transgenic papaya varieties that are resistant to PRSV entered production in 1998 and resuscitated the industry.[6]\nBoth pathotypes are distributed worldwide. PRSV-P, for example, is known to be present in the Middle East, Africa, South and Central American. It has also been found in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Taiwan, and the United States. PRSV-W isolates have been found in the United States, the Caribbean, Mexico, Italy, Germany, Australia, France, India, the Middle East, and South America.\nUsing genetic phylogeny studies, researchers suspect the virus originated in Asia, likely India, about 2,250 years ago. From there it slowly spread through the continent reaching China about 600 years ago. It was also introduced directly from India to Australia and the Americas within the last 300 years. Papayas were introduced to India only 500 years ago, at which point the virus made the jump from cucurbits. However, the virus has switched back and forth between pathotypes many times in its evolution.[7]\nSymptoms are typical of viral diseases. Papaya exhibits yellowing, leaf distortion, and severe mosaic. Oily or water-soaked spots and streaks appear on the trunk and petioles. The fruit will exhibit bumps and the classic \"ringspot\". A severe isolate of PRSV has also been shown to cause tissue necrosis.[8] Cucurbit symptoms tend to be similar to papaya symptoms including blisters, mosaic, yellowing, and leaf distortions.[9]\nThis virus produces two types of inclusion bodies visible under a light microscope with proper staining of epidemal strips.[10] One inclusion is the typical cylidrical inclusion (CI) which is considered diagnostic for the potyvirus group, and the other is called the amorphous inclusion (AI). The presence of both inclusions can be diagnostic for this virus.[11]\nIn squash, watermelon and other cucurbits, PRSV-W causes mottling and distortion of leaves and fruit.[12] PRSV-W is considered to be one of the limiting factors in the growing of cucurbits in Florida.[13]\nPRSV-W should not be confused with Watermelon mosaic virus 2, another potyvirus that infects cucurbits around the world, including Florida, and which is now known simply as Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). PRSV has a different host range, different serological properties, and no nucleotide sequence homology with WMV.[14] WMV also has different cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that can differentiate it from PRSV-W.[15]\nPolyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been made for both of the CI and AI proteins as well as for the capsid protein of PRSV-W.[16]\nAphids are the predominant means by which PRSV is transmitted. PRSV is a non-persistent virus, meaning it does not enter beyond the feeding mouthparts of the aphid, and does not circulate or multiply within its insect host. Non-persistent viruses are transmitted quickly and easily between plants. Many species of aphid can transmit PRSV, particularly the Peach Aphid and Melon Aphid.[17]\nSeed transmission has been observed at rates of 2 infected second generation plants out of 1355.[18] This method of transmission is marginal compared to transmission through aphid vectors.[19] However, if infected seed survives, it could then function as a source on inoculum, which then could be spread by insect vectors.\nDisease transmission can also occur by planting infected seedlings in fields where the virus is not present. Using \"clean\", virus-free seedlings for planting is of very high importance.\nThere is no known resistance to PRSV, although certain varieties are more symptomatic than others.[20] There are four main methods of control for PRSV: quarantine and geographic displacement, roguing and netting, cross-protection, and genetic modification of the host plant. Because PRSV is a non-persistent virus and is consequently transmitted to healthy plants by aphids within a very short time period, insecticidal control is difficult and impractical. Once symptoms have been observed, it is already too late to spray for aphids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the disease has most likely already been transmitted to nearby healthy plants. In order to implement successful vector control, frequent preventative sprays are required, which is rarely done.\nPrevention through quarantine and geographic displacement of cropland is common and has occurred in Hawaii, the Philippines and Brazil.[19][20] When fields become infected, such as the case of Oahu papaya growers, attempts to relocate growing areas to virus-free fields are made. This is usually just a temporary avoidance of the disease, which eventually spreads to the new fields.\nRoguing, or the removal and destruction of infected plants, is a way to control the spread of PRSV. This method was employed unsuccessfully when PRSV began to invade the Puna region of Hawaii. It is difficult to suppress the spread of PRSV through rouging because it is spread very quickly and effectively by aphids.\nNetting can also be used to prevent insect vectors from spreading the virus. Production under netting is prohibitively expensive for subsistence and small-scale producers,[20] but was used effectively in Taiwan because geographical displacement was not possible on such a small island.[21]\nCross protection is similar in practice, although not in mode of action, to viral vaccinations in humans. A mild strain of PRSV is introduced into the host plant, which then develops resistance to virulent strains of the virus. Development of cross-protection in papaya was researched in Hawaii starting in 1979. A delay in the onset of symptoms was achieved, as well as a reduction in the severity of symptoms. However, inoculation of the mild strain also caused pathogenesis on the papaya plants.[19]\nThere are two transgenic varieties of papaya, both of which were created by Dennis Gonsalves[22] and his team and were introduced for production in May 1, 1998.[23] Rainbow (created by Dennis Gonsalves[22]) is an F1 hybrid, which is a cross between the yellow fleshed Kapoho and the red-fleshed SunUp.[24] Rainbow is produced on 76% of Hawaiian papaya acreage, while SunUp is hardly grown commercially. SunUp is thought to be more resistant to exotic strains of PRSV, while Rainbow has shown susceptibility to such exotic strains of the virus.[20] Transgenic varieties have been shown to be extremely effective against Hawaiian strains of PRSV, showing complete resistance to the virus compared to 100% infection of susceptible strains in some trials.[25]\nPathogen-derived resistance (PDR) is the technique of inserting a gene fragment from the pathogen into the transgenic crop, which then affords the crop plant resistance against the pathogen. This method was employed in the development of transgenic papaya. PRSV's coat protein gene was inserted into highly embryogenic plant tissue by using the newly invented gene gun, which led to the development of the transgenic line 55-1, which was proven to be effective at controlling Hawaiian strains of PRSV.\nThe evaluation of whether or not to release transgenic papaya in the United States was undertaken by APHIS, the EPA and the FDA. This incident was unique in that transgenic crops are usually developed and promoted by commercial operations, while transgenic papaya and the case for deregulation was adopted by University of Hawaii researchers. The university was highly motivated to help save the Hawaiian papaya industry, and consequently took a leading role in pushing for commercialization of the fruit.[19]\nJapan is 20% of Hawaii's export market. Japan had been resistant to approve GMO papaya since its introduction in 1998. As of 2011, the Rainbow transgenic papaya has been approved for export to Japan.[24]\nSo far in Hawaii, there has been no breakdown of the coat protein resistance encoded in transgenic strains of papaya. Exposure to foreign strains of the virus is a serious risk, as Rainbow papayas have been shown to be susceptible to PRSV from Guam, Taiwan and Thailand.[20][26]\nIn Hawaii, PRSV has had dramatic effects. Between 1992 and 1997, nearly all fields in the Puna region had been affected.[19] This is a local industry worth $11 million annually.[27]\nPapaya is grown for personal consumption by small subsistence farmers in parts of Southeast Asia, with small surpluses sold at market. PRSV is the biggest constraint to papaya production in the Philippines. In 1994, PRSV damage had destroyed 60 million pesos worth of papaya production in the Southern Tagalog area, and had reduced production levels by 80%.[20]\nBrazil accounts for nearly half of global output, with India second and Nigeria third in worldwide production.[28] Dramatic geographical shifts of production to avoid PRSV have been common. For example, between 1973 and 1984, papaya production moved substantially in Brazil away from Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo to the northern states of Espirito Santo and Bahia.[19] As with the case of Hawaii, PRSV generally catches up to the industry\u2019s movements over time. The total economic costs of such redistributive costs are unknown, but likely significant.\nBacklash against GMO papaya has resulted in surreptitious destruction of papaya plantations under the cover of darkness. In some cases, farmers have lost up to $15,000 worth of papaya trees.[27]",

        "text": "535 voting members\nThe United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the Federal government of the United States consisting of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.\nThe Congress meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 435 Representatives and 100 Senators. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members representing Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington, D.C. in addition to its 435 voting members. Although they cannot vote, these members can sit on congressional committees and introduce legislation.\nThe members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a single constituency, known as a \"district\". Congressional districts are apportioned to states by population using the United States Census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators. Currently, there are 100 senators representing the 50 states. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election.\nTo be eligible for election, a candidate must be aged at least 25 (House) or 30 (Senate), have been a citizen of the United States for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent.\nThe Congress was created by the Constitution of the United States and first met in 1789, replacing in its legislative function the Congress of the Confederation. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party and only rarely to a third party or as independents.\nArticle One of the United States Constitution states, \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\" The House and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlegislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers. However, the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers. The Senate ratifies treaties and approves presidential appointments while the House initiates revenue-raising bills. The House initiates impeachment cases, while the Senate decides impeachment cases.[1] A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required before an impeached person can be forcibly removed from office.[1]\nThe term Congress can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature. A Congress covers two years; the current one, the 115th Congress, began on January 3, 2017, and will end on January 3, 2019. The Congress starts and ends on the third day of January of every odd-numbered year. Members of the Senate are referred to as senators; members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives, congressmen, or congresswomen.\nScholar and representative Lee H. Hamilton asserted that the \"historic mission of Congress has been to maintain freedom\" and insisted it was a \"driving force in American government\"[2] and a \"remarkably resilient institution\".[3] Congress is the \"heart and soul of our democracy\", according to this view,[4] even though legislators rarely achieve the prestige or name recognition of presidents or Supreme Court justices; one wrote that \"legislators remain ghosts in America's historical imagination\".[4] One analyst argues that it is not a solely reactive institution but has played an active role in shaping government policy and is extraordinarily sensitive to public pressure.[4] Several academics described Congress:\nCongress reflects us in all our strengths and all our weaknesses. It reflects our regional idiosyncrasies, our ethnic, religious, and racial diversity, our multitude of professions, and our shadings of opinion on everything from the value of war to the war over values. Congress is the government's most representative body ... Congress is essentially charged with reconciling our many points of view on the great public policy issues of the day.\nCongress is constantly changing and is constantly in flux.[5] In recent times, the American south and west have gained House seats according to demographic changes recorded by the census and includes more minorities and women although both groups are still underrepresented, according to one view.[5] While power balances among the different parts of government continue to change, the internal structure of Congress is important to understand along with its interactions with so-called intermediary institutions such as political parties, civic associations, interest groups, and the mass media.[4]\nThe Congress of the United States serves two distinct purposes that overlap: local representation to the federal government of a congressional district by representatives and a state's at-large representation to the federal government by senators.\nMost incumbents seek re-election, and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections exceeds 90 percent.[6]\nThe historical records of the House of Representatives and the Senate are maintained by the Center for Legislative Archives, which is a part of the National Archives and Records Administration.[7]\nCongress is directly responsible for the governing of the District of Columbia, the current seat of the federal government.\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the thirteen British Colonies in North America.[8] On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, referring to the new nation as the \"United States of America\". The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created the Congress of the Confederation, a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions. Congress had executive but not legislative authority, and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty.[9] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws.[10][11]\nGovernment powerlessness led to the Convention of 1787 which proposed a revised constitution with a two\u2013chamber or bicameral congress.[12] Smaller states argued for equal representation for each state.[13] The two-chamber structure had functioned well in state governments.[14] A compromise plan was adopted with representatives chosen by population (benefiting larger states) and exactly two senators chosen by state governments (benefiting smaller states).[5][15] The ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government.[16][17][18] To protect against abuse of power, each branch of government\u2014executive, legislative, and judicial\u2014had a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers.[1] Furthermore, there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers.[19] The new government became active in 1789.[1][20]\nPolitical scientist Julian E. Zelizer suggested there were four main congressional eras, with considerable overlap, and included the formative era (1780s\u20131820s), the partisan era (1830s\u20131900s), the committee era (1910s\u20131960s), and the contemporary era (1970s\u2013today).[21]\nFederalists and anti-federalists jostled for power in the early years as political parties became pronounced, surprising the Constitution's Founding Fathers of the United States. With the passage of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Anti-Federalist movement was exhausted. Some activists joined the Anti-Administration Party that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were forming about 1790\u00e2\u20ac\u201c91 to oppose policies of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton; it soon became the Democratic-Republican Party or the Jeffersonian Democrat Party and began the era of the First Party System. Thomas Jefferson's election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties in 1800. John Marshall, 4th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case Marbury v. Madison in 1803, effectively giving the Supreme Court a power to nullify congressional legislation.\nThese years were marked by growth in the power of political parties. The watershed event was the Civil War which resolved the slavery issue and unified the nation under federal authority, but weakened the power of states rights. The Gilded Age (1877\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1901) was marked by Republican dominance of Congress. During this time, lobbying activity became more intense, particularly during the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool.[22] Immigration and high birth rates swelled the ranks of citizens and the nation grew at a rapid pace. The Progressive Era was characterized by strong party leadership in both houses of Congress as well as calls for reform; sometimes reformers would attack lobbyists as corrupting politics.[23] The position of Speaker of the House became extremely powerful under leaders such as Thomas Reed in 1890 and Joseph Gurney Cannon. The Senate was effectively controlled by a half dozen men.\nA system of seniority\u2014in which long-time Members of Congress gained more and more power\u2014encouraged politicians of both parties to serve for long terms. Committee chairmen remained influential in both houses until the reforms of the 1970s.\nImportant structural changes included the direct election of senators by popular election according to the Seventeenth Amendment[15] , ratified in April 8, 1913, with positive effects (senators more sensitive to public opinion) and negative effects (undermining the authority of state governments).[15] Supreme Court decisions based on the Constitution's commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy.[24] One effect of popular election of senators was to reduce the difference between the House and Senate in terms of their link to the electorate.[25] Lame duck reforms according to the Twentieth Amendment ended the power of defeated and retiring members of Congress to wield influence despite their lack of accountability.[26]\nThe Great Depression ushered in President Franklin Roosevelt and strong control by Democrats[27] and historic New Deal policies. Roosevelt's election in 1932 marked a shift in government power towards the executive branch. Numerous New Deal initiatives came from the White House rather than being initiated by Congress.[28] The Democratic Party controlled both houses of Congress for many years.[29][30][31] During this time, Republicans and conservative southern Democrats[32] formed the Conservative Coalition.[31][33] Democrats maintained control of Congress during World War II.[34][35] Congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by reducing the number of standing congressional committees.[36] Southern Democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated between Republicans and Democrats during these years. More complex issues required greater specialization and expertise, such as space flight and atomic energy policy.[36] Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited the fear of communism and conducted televised hearings.[37][38] In 1960, Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to the Democrats who dominated both houses of Congress until 1994.\nCongress enacted Johnson's Great Society program to fight poverty and hunger. The Watergate Scandal had a powerful effect of waking up a somewhat dormant Congress which investigated presidential wrongdoing and coverups; the scandal \"substantially reshaped\" relations between the branches of government, suggested political scientist Bruce J. Schulman.[40] Partisanship returned, particularly after 1994; one analyst attributes partisan infighting to slim congressional majorities which discouraged friendly social gatherings in meeting rooms such as the Board of Education.[4] Congress began reasserting its authority.[28][41] Lobbying became a big factor despite the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. Political action committees or PACs could make substantive donations to congressional candidates via such means as soft money contributions.[42] While soft money funds were not given to specific campaigns for candidates, the money often benefited candidates substantially in an indirect way and helped reelect candidates.[42] Reforms such as the 2002 McCain-Feingold act limited campaign donations but did not limit soft money contributions.[43] One source suggests post-Watergate laws amended in 1974 meant to reduce the \"influence of wealthy contributors and end payoffs\" instead \"legitimized PACs\" since they \"enabled individuals to band together in support of candidates\".[44] From 1974 to 1984, PACs grew from 608 to 3,803 and donations leaped from $12.5 million to $120 million[44][45][46] along with concern over PAC influence in Congress.[47][48] In 2009, there were 4,600 business, labor and special-interest PACs[49] including ones for lawyers, electricians, and real estate brokers.[50] From 2007 to 2008, 175 members of Congress received \"half or more of their campaign cash\" from PACs.[49][51][52]\nFrom 1970 to 2009, the House expanded delegates, along with their powers and privileges representing U.S. citizens in non-state areas, beginning with representation on committees for Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in 1970. In 1971, a delegate for the District of Columbia was authorized, and in 1972 new delegate positions were established for U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. 1978 saw an additional delegate for American Samoa, and another for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands began in 2009. These six Members of Congress enjoy floor privileges to introduce bills and resolutions, and in recent congresses they vote in permanent and select committees, in party caucuses and in joint conferences with the Senate. They have Capitol Hill offices, staff and two annual appointments to each of the four military academies. While their votes are constitutional when Congress authorizes their House Committee of the Whole votes, recent Congresses have not allowed for that, and they cannot vote when the House is meeting as the House of Representatives.[53]\nIn the late 20th century, the media became more important in Congress's work.[54] Analyst Michael Schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused \"more roads to open up in Congress for individual representatives to influence decisions\".[54] Norman Ornstein suggested that media prominence led to a greater emphasis on the negative and sensational side of Congress, and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage.[5] Others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty-second soundbite.[55] A report characterized Congress in 2013 as being unproductive, gridlocked, and \"setting records for futility\".[56] In October 2013, with Congress unable to compromise, the government was shut down for several weeks and risked a serious default on debt payments, causing 60% of the public to say they would \"fire every member of Congress\" including their own representative.[57] One report suggested Congress posed the \"biggest risk to the US economy\" because of its brinksmanship, \"down-to-the-wire budget and debt crises\" and \"indiscriminate spending cuts\", resulting in slowed economic activity and keeping up to two million people unemployed.[58] There has been increasing public dissatisfaction with Congress,[59] with extremely low approval ratings[60][61] which dropped to 5% in October 2013.[62]\nArticle I of the Constitution creates and sets forth the structure and most of the powers of Congress. Sections One through Six describe how Congress is elected and gives each House the power to create its own structure. Section Seven lays out the process for creating laws, and Section Eight enumerates numerous powers. Section Nine is a list of powers Congress does not have, and Section Ten enumerates powers of the state, some of which may only be granted by Congress.[63] Constitutional amendments have granted Congress additional powers. Congress also has implied powers derived from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause.\nCongress has authority over financial and budgetary policy through the enumerated power to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States\". There is vast authority over budgets, although analyst Eric Patashnik suggested that much of Congress's power to manage the budget has been lost when the welfare state expanded since \"entitlements were institutionally detached from Congress's ordinary legislative routine and rhythm\".[64] Another factor leading to less control over the budget was a Keynesian belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary.[64]\nThe Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 extended congressional power of taxation to include income taxes without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.[65] The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds, and this power of the purse is one of Congress's primary checks on the executive branch.[65] Congress can borrow money on the credit of the United States, regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, and coin money.[66] Generally, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have equal legislative authority, although only the House may originate revenue and appropriation bills.[1]\nCongress has an important role in national defense, including the exclusive power to declare war, to raise and maintain the armed forces, and to make rules for the military.[67] Some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped Congress's constitutionally defined task of declaring war.[68] While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war, they asked for and received formal war declarations from Congress for the War of 1812, the Mexican\u2013American War, the Spanish\u2013American War, World War I, and World War II,[69] although President Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903 did not get congressional approval.[69] In the early days after the North Korean invasion of 1950, President Truman described the American response as a \"police action\".[70] According to Time magazine in 1970, \"U.S. presidents [had] ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times.\"[69] In 1993, Michael Kinsley wrote that \"Congress's war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the Constitution,\" and that the \"real erosion [of Congress's war power] began after World War II.\"[71][72][73] Disagreement about the extent of congressional versus presidential power regarding war has been present periodically throughout the nation's history.\"[74]\nCongress can establish post offices and post roads, issue patents and copyrights, fix standards of weights and measures, establish Courts inferior to the Supreme Court, and \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" Article Four gives Congress the power to admit new states into the Union.\nOne of Congress's foremost non-legislative functions is the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch.[75] Congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by Congress's subpoena power.[76] Some critics have charged that Congress has in some instances failed to do an adequate job of overseeing the other branches of government. In the Plame affair, critics including Representative Henry A. Waxman charged that Congress was not doing an adequate job of oversight in this case.[77] There have been concerns about congressional oversight of executive actions such as warrantless wiretapping, although others respond that Congress did investigate the legality of presidential decisions.[78] Political scientists Ornstein and Mann suggested that oversight functions do not help members of Congress win reelection. Congress also has the exclusive power of removal, allowing impeachment and removal of the president, federal judges and other federal officers.[79] There have been charges that presidents acting under the doctrine of the unitary executive have assumed important legislative and budgetary powers that should belong to Congress.[80] So-called signing statements are one way in which a president can \"tip the balance of power between Congress and the White House a little more in favor of the executive branch,\" according to one account.[81] Past presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush[82] have made public statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it, and commentators including the American Bar Association have described this practice as against the spirit of the Constitution.[83][84] There have been concerns that presidential authority to cope with financial crises is eclipsing the power of Congress.[85] In 2008, George F. Will called the Capitol building a \"tomb for the antiquated idea that the legislative branch matters.\"[86]\nThe Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress in detail. In addition, other congressional powers have been granted, or confirmed, by constitutional amendments. The Thirteenth (1865), Fourteenth (1868), and Fifteenth Amendments (1870) gave Congress authority to enact legislation to enforce rights of African Americans, including voting rights, due process, and equal protection under the law.[87] Generally militia forces are controlled by state governments, not Congress.[88]\nCongress also has implied powers deriving from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause which permit Congress to \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\"[89] Broad interpretations of this clause and of the Commerce Clause, the enumerated power to regulate commerce, in rulings such as McCulloch v Maryland, have effectively widened the scope of Congress's legislative authority far beyond that prescribed in Section 8.[90][91]\nConstitutional responsibility for the oversight of Washington, D.C., the federal district and national capital and the U.S. territories of Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands rests with Congress.[92] The republican form of government in territories is devolved by Congressional statute to the respective territories including direct election of governors, the D.C. mayor and locally elective territorial legislatures.[93]\nEach territory and Washington, D.C. elect a non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives as they have throughout Congressional history. They \"\nWashington, D.C. citizens alone among U.S. territories have the right to directly vote for the President of the United States, although the Democratic and Republican political parties nominate their presidential candidates at national conventions which include delegates from the five major territories.[95]\nRepresentative Lee H. Hamilton explained how Congress functions within the federal government:\nTo me the key to understanding it is balance. The founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbalancing powers among the three branches: Congress, the president, and the Supreme Court; between the House of Representatives and the Senate; between the federal government and the states; among states of different sizes and regions with different interests; between the powers of government and the rights of citizens, as spelled out in the Bill of Rights ... No one part of government dominates the other.[2]:6\nThe Constitution provides checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government. Its authors expected the greater power to lie with Congress as described in Article One.[2][96]\nThe influence of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on factors such as congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards.[97] The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush.[98] However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century.[2][98] Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they may be in the dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies.[99] Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or do a good job of overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.[100]\nThe Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to impeach both executive and judicial officials for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Impeachment is a formal accusation of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only two presidents have ever been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. Both trials ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. In 1974, Richard Nixon resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee indicated he would eventually be removed from office.\nThe Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming Cabinet officials, judges, and other high officers \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010.[101] The House of Representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials, other than in filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president; in such a case, a majority vote in each House is required to confirm a president's nomination of a vice president.[1]\nIn 1803, the Supreme Court established judicial review of federal legislation in Marbury v. Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said.[102] Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its Dred Scott decision.[103] At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.\nInvestigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation, to test the effectiveness of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches. Committees may hold hearings, and, if necessary, compel individuals to testify when investigating issues over which it has the power to legislate by issuing subpoenas.[104][105] Witnesses who refuse to testify may be cited for contempt of Congress, and those who testify falsely may be charged with perjury. Most committee hearings are open to the public (the House and Senate intelligence committees are the exception); important hearings are widely reported in the mass media and transcripts published a few months afterwards.[105] Congress, in the course of studying possible laws and investigating matters, generates an incredible amount of information in various forms, and can be described as a publisher.[106] Indeed, it publishes House and Senate reports[106] and maintains databases which are updated irregularly with publications in a variety of electronic formats.[106]\nCongress also plays a role in presidential elections. Both Houses meet in joint session on the sixth day of January following a presidential election to count the electoral votes, and there are procedures to follow if no candidate wins a majority.[1]\nThe main result of congressional activity is the creation of laws,[107] most of which are contained in the United States Code, arranged by subject matter alphabetically under fifty title headings to present the laws \"in a concise and usable form\".[1]\nCongress is split into two chambers\u2014House and Senate\u2014and manages the task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress.[108] As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects. Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs. The choice of specialty may be influenced by the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience.[109] Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap.[110] Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs.[111]\nCommittees write legislation. While procedures such as the House discharge petition process can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.[112] They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.[112] In addition, they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.[112]\nAt the start of each two-year session the House elects a speaker who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the Vice President is the ex officio president of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the President pro tempore. Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there's a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800. It is primarily housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill, but also includes several other sites: the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Washington, D.C.; the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Virginia; a large book storage facility located at Ft. Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the War of 1812, but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of Thomas Jefferson's private library. One of the Library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public. It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages.[113]\nThe Congressional Research Service provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan research for senators, representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties. It provides ideas for legislation, helps members analyze a bill, facilitates public hearings, makes reports, consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure, and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements. It has been called the \"House's think tank\" and has a staff of about 900 employees.[114]\nThe Congressional Budget Office or CBO is a federal agency which provides economic data to Congress.[115]\nIt was created as an independent nonpartisan agency by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It helps Congress estimate revenue inflows from taxes and helps the budgeting process. It makes projections about such matters as the national debt[116] as well as likely costs of legislation. It prepares an annual Economic and Budget Outlook with a mid-year update and writes An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for the Senate's Appropriations Committee. The Speaker of the House and the Senate's President pro tempore jointly appoint the CBO Director for a four-year term.\nLobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients' needs. Lobby groups and their members sometimes write legislation and whip bills. In 2007, there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington.[117] They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations. Some lobbyists represent non-profit organizations and work pro bono for issues in which they are personally interested.\nCongress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting known as partisanship. The period after the Civil War was marked by partisanship as is the case today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.[118]\nA term of Congress is divided into two \"sessions\", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session. A new session commences on January 3 each year unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\nJoint Sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president's State of the Union address. The constitutionally-mandated report, normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's Speech from the Throne, was written by most presidents after Jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with Wilson in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the Speaker of the House except when counting presidential electoral votes when the Vice President (acting as the President of the Senate) presides.\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills. Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review.[1] A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\nRepresentatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the hopper on the Clerk's desk.[107] It's assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage.[107] Drafting statutes requires \"great skill, knowledge, and experience\" and sometimes take a year or more.[1] Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate procedure. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" While the Senate cannot originate revenue and appropriation bills, it has power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels.[1]\nEach chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a Rules Committee guides legislation; in the Senate, a Standing Rules committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting \"unanimous consent\" for noncontroversial matters.[1] House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before becoming a law.[2] Members sometimes use experts such as Walter Oleszek, a senior specialist in American national government at the Congressional Research Service, to learn about proper procedures.[119]\nEach bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the Government Accountability Office.[1] Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month.[1] Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting.[1] A committee might call for public hearings on important bills.[1] Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill.[107] Then, a bill may go to what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions.[107] Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number.[107] Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.[120]\nA bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex[107] and begins with an enacting formula such as \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.\" Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtime limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.[107] Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.[107] Sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it.[107] Generally, discussion requires a quorum, usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.[121] The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ. A final vote on the bill follows.\nOnce a bill is approved by one house, it is sent to the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill.[107] If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a conference committee, an ad hoc committee that includes both senators and representatives[107] sometimes by using a reconciliation process to limit budget bills.[1] Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as pay-as-you-go or paygo which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits.[1] If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.\nThe Constitution specifies that a majority of members known as a quorum be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a quorum call demonstrates the contrary. Since representatives and senators who are present rarely demand quorum calls, debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.\nVoting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting.[1] Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout \"aye\" or \"no\" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a recorded vote if demanded by one-fifth of the members present. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses roll-call voting, in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating \"aye\" or \"no\" when their name is announced. In the Senate, the vice president may cast the tie-breaking vote if present.\nThe House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote yea or nay or present or open.[1] Members insert a voting ID card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyea indicated by green and nay by red.[1] One member can not cast a proxy vote for another.[1] Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.[122][123]\nAfter passage by both houses, a bill is enrolled and sent to the president for approval.[107] The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with their objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing\u2014neither signing nor vetoing the bill\u2014and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution. But if Congress is adjourned during this period, presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it; the maneuver is known as a pocket veto, and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.\nSenators face reelection every six years, and representatives every two. Reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts.[54] Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund-raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing, according to some critics[124] although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters.\nNevertheless, incumbent members of Congress running for reelection have strong advantages over challengers.[42] They raise more money[47] because donors expect incumbents to win, they give their funds to them rather than challengers,[45][125] and donations are vital for winning elections.[126] One critic compared being elected to Congress to receiving life tenure at a university.[125] Another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering.[127][128] After each ten-year census, states are allocated representatives based on population, and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party. As a result, reelection rates of members of Congress hover around 90 percent,[6] causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class.[5] Academics such as Princeton's Stephen Macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering. Both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges called franking privileges.\nIn 1971, the cost of running for congress in Utah was $70,000[129] but costs have climbed.[130] The biggest expense is television ads.[46][125][129][131][132] Today's races cost more than a million dollars for a House seat, and six million or more for a Senate seat.[5][46][131][133][134] Since fundraising is vital, \"members of Congress are forced to spend ever-increasing hours raising money for their re-election.\"[135]\nNevertheless, the Supreme Court has treated campaign contributions as a free speech issue.[130] Some see money as a good influence in politics since it \"enables candidates to communicate with voters.\"[130] Few members retire from Congress without complaining about how much it costs to campaign for reelection.[5] Critics contend that members of Congress are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens.[5]\nElections are influenced by many variables. Some political scientists speculate there is a coattail effect (when a popular president or party position has the effect of reelecting incumbents who win by \"riding on the president's coattails\"), although there is some evidence that the coattail effect is irregular and possibly declining since the 1950s.[42] Some districts are so heavily Democratic or Republican that they are called a safe seat; any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected, and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising.[136][137] But some races can be competitive when there is no incumbent. If a seat becomes vacant in an open district, then both parties may spend heavily on advertising in these races; in California in 1992, only four of twenty races for House seats were considered highly competitive.[138]\nSince members of Congress must advertise heavily on television, this usually involves negative advertising, which smears an opponent's character without focusing on the issues.[139] Negative advertising is seen as effective because \"the messages tend to stick.\"[140] However, these ads sour the public on the political process in general as most members of Congress seek to avoid blame.[141] One wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election, which leads to a culture of risk avoidance, a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors,[141] and concentrating publicity efforts in the members' home districts.[54]\nProminent Founding Fathers writing in The Federalist Papers felt that elections were essential to liberty, and that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential[142] and that \"frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.\"[142] In 2009, however, few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress.[143][144][145] The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but has been falling since, although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election.[146] Public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job Congress is doing have, in the last few decades, hovered around 25% with some variation.[5][147][148][149][150][151][152] Scholar Julian Zeliger suggested that the \"size, messiness, virtues, and vices that make Congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution... Unlike the presidency, Congress is difficult to conceptualize.\"[153] Other scholars suggest that despite the criticism, \"Congress is a remarkably resilient institution ... its place in the political process is not threatened ... it is rich in resources\" and that most members behave ethically.[3] They contend that \"Congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend\" and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for Congress run against Congress, which is an \"old form of American politics\" that further undermines Congress's reputation with the public:[5]\nThe rough-and-tumble world of legislating is not orderly and civil, human frailties too often taint its membership, and legislative outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... Still, we are not exaggerating when we say that Congress is essential to American democracy. We would not have survived as a nation without a Congress that represented the diverse interests of our society, conducted a public debate on the major issues, found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully, and limited the power of our executive, military, and judicial institutions ... The popularity of Congress ebbs and flows with the public's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike\u2014it often generates political posturing and grandstanding, it necessarily involves compromise, and it often leaves broken promises in its trail. Also, members of Congress often appear self-serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial. Scandals, even when they involve a single member, add to the public's frustration with Congress and have contributed to the institution's low ratings in opinion polls.\u2014Smith, Roberts & Wielen[5]\nAn additional factor that confounds public perceptions of Congress is that congressional issues are becoming more technical and complex and require expertise in subjects such as science, engineering and economics.[5] As a result, Congress often cedes authority to experts at the executive branch.[5]\nSince 2006, Congress has dropped 10 points in the Gallup confidence poll with only 9% having \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in their legislators.[154] Since 2011, Gallup poll has reported Congress's approval rating among Americans at 10% or below three times.[60][61] Public opinion of Congress plummeted further to 5% in October 2013 after parts of the U.S. government deemed 'nonessential government' shut down.[62]\nWhen the Constitution was ratified in 1787, the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one. The Connecticut Compromise gave every state, large and small, an equal vote in the Senate.[155] Since each state has two senators, residents of smaller states have more clout in the Senate than residents of larger states. But since 1787, the population disparity between large and small states has grown; in 2006, for example, California had seventy times the population of Wyoming.[156] Critics such as constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady redistribution of resources from \"large states to small states.\"[157][158][159] However, others argue that the Connecticut compromise was deliberately intended by the Framers to construct the Senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population,[155] and contend that the result works well on balance.\nA major role for members of Congress is providing services to constituents.[160] Constituents request assistance with problems.[161] Providing services helps members of Congress win votes and elections[127][162][163] and can make a difference in close races.[164] Congressional staff can help citizens navigate government bureaucracies.[2] One academic described the complex intertwined relation between lawmakers and constituents as home style.[165]:8\nOne way to categorize lawmakers, according to political scientist Richard Fenno, is by their general motivation:\nMembers of Congress enjoy parliamentary privilege, including freedom from arrest in all cases except for treason, felony, and breach of the peace and freedom of speech in debate. This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions.[166] The term arrest has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of law enforcement, including court summons and subpoenas. The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.\" Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for slander because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress.\nObstructing the work of Congress is a crime under federal law and is known as contempt of Congress. Each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.\nThe franking privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense. Though they are not permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races.[167][168] Indeed, some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers.[6][169]\nFrom 1789 to 1815, members of Congress received only a daily payment of $6 while in session. Members received an annual salary of $1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of $8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at $3,000.[170][171] In 1907, salaries were raised to $7,500 per year, the equivalent of $173,000 in 2010.[171] In 2006, members of Congress received a yearly salary of $165,200.[171] Congressional leaders were paid $183,500 per year. The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns $212,100 annually. The salary of the President pro tempore for 2006 was $183,500, equal to that of the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate.[172] Privileges include having an office and paid staff.[120] In 2008, non-officer members of Congress earned $169,300 annually.[147] Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American income of $45,113 for men and $35,102 for women.[173] Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government.[147] In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires.[174] Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute.[175] Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress.[129][132] Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving\u2013\u2013that Congress was a \"Farm League for K Street\"\u2013\u2013instead of on public service.[176][177]\nMembers elected since 1984 are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Like other federal employees, congressional retirement is funded through taxes and participants' contributions. Members of Congress under FERS contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. And like Federal employees, members contribute one-third of the cost of health insurance with the government covering the other two-thirds.[178]\nThe size of a congressional pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest three years of their salary. By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.[179]\nMembers of Congress make fact-finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed, but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2009 that lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense had included spas, $300-per-night extra unused rooms, and shopping excursions.[180] Lawmakers respond that \"traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in Washington\" and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations.[180]",

        "text": "European Parliament Elections\nBrexit (/\u02c8br\u025bks\u026at, \u02c8br\u025b\u0261z\u026at/) is the prospective withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU).\nIn a referendum on 23 June 2016, 51.9% of the participating UK electorate voted to leave the EU, out of a turnout of 72.2%. On 29 March 2017, the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union. The UK is thus due to leave the EU at midnight on 30 March 2019 Central European Time (11\u00c2\u00a0pm on 29 March 2019 GMT).[1]\nPrime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK would not seek permanent membership of the single market or the customs union after leaving the EU[2][3] and promised to repeal the European Communities Act of 1972 and incorporate existing European Union law into UK domestic law.[4] A new government department, the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), was created in July 2016, with Eurosceptic David Davis appointed its first Secretary of State. Negotiations with the EU officially started in June 2017.\nThe UK joined the European Communities (EC) in 1973, with membership confirmed by a referendum in 1975. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by Labour Party members and trade union figures. From the 1990s, the main advocates of withdrawal were the newly founded UK Independence Party (UKIP) and an increasing number of Eurosceptic Conservative Party members.\nThere is strong agreement among economists and a broad consensus in existing economic research that Brexit is likely to reduce UK's real per-capita income in the medium and long-term.[5][6] Studies on effects that have already materialised since the referendum show annual losses of \u00a3404 for the average British household and a loss of 1.3% of UK GDP.[7][8] Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK,[9] and poses challenges for UK higher education and academic research.[10] The size of the \"divorce bill\", Britain's international agreements, relations with the Republic of Ireland, and the borders with France and between Gibraltar and Spain are uncertain. The precise impact on the UK depends on whether it is a \"hard\" Brexit or a \"soft\" Brexit.\nHard and soft Brexit\nIn 1951 the \"Inner Six\" European countries signed the Treaty of Paris establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), followed shortly by the 1957 Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). In 1967 these became known as the European Communities (EC). The UK applied to join in 1963 and 1967, but was vetoed by the French President, Charles de Gaulle.[20] After de Gaulle relinquished the French presidency the UK successfully applied for membership and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972,[21] Parliament passed the European Communities Act later in the year[22] and the UK became a member of the EC on 1 January 1973 with Denmark and Ireland.[23]\nThe opposition Labour Party contested the October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the EC and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms.[24] After Labour won the election the United Kingdom held its first national referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Communities in 1975. Despite significant division within the ruling Labour Party[25] all major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. On 5 June 1975, 67.2% of the electorate and all but two[26] UK counties and regions voted to stay in[27] and support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975 appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum.[28]\nThe Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum[29] although after a heavy defeat Labour changed its policy.[29] In 1985 the Thatcher government ratified the Single European Act\u2014the first major revision to the Treaty of Rome\u2014without a referendum.\nIn October 1990, under pressure from senior ministers and despite Margaret Thatcher's deep reservations, the United Kingdom joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark. Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister the following month, amid Conservative Party divisions arising partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. The United Kingdom and Italy were forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling and the lira came under pressure (\"Black Wednesday\").[30]\nUnder the Maastricht Treaty, the European Communities became the European Union on 1 November 1993,[31] reflecting the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political union.[32]\nIn 1994 Sir James Goldsmith formed the Referendum Party to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the nature of the United Kingdom's relationship with the EU.[33][34] It fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votes or 2.6% of the total votes cast,[35] although it failed to win a single parliamentary seat due to its vote being spread across the country. The Referendum Party disbanded after Goldsmith's death in 1997.\nThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was also formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than the Labour or Conservative parties had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election.[36] UKIP's electoral success in the 2014 European election has been documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the leave campaign in the 2016 referendum.[37]\nIn 2014 UKIP won two by-elections, triggered by defecting Conservative MPs, and in the 2015 general election took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014.[38]\nSince 1977 both pro- and anti-EU views have had majority support at different times.[39] In the European Communities membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership.\nIn a statistical analysis published in April 2016, Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University defined Euroscepticism as the wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU, and conversely Europhilia as the desire to preserve or increase the powers of the EU. According to this definition, the British Social Attitudes (BSA) surveys show an increase in euroscepticism from 38% (1993) to 65% (2015). Euroscepticism should however not be confused with the wish to leave the EU: the BSA survey for the period July\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNovember 2015 shows that 60% backed the option \"continue as an EU member\", and only 30% backed the option to \"withdraw\".[40]\nIn 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron rejected calls for a referendum on the UK's EU membership, but suggested the possibility of a future referendum to gauge public support.[41][42] According to the BBC, \"The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK's position within the European Union had 'the full-hearted support of the British people' but they needed to show 'tactical and strategic patience'.\"[43]\nUnder pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, in January 2013, Cameron announced that a Conservative government would hold an in\u00e2\u20ac\u201cout referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in 2015.[44]\nThe Conservative Party unexpectedly won the 2015 general election with a majority. Soon afterwards the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Cameron favoured remaining in a reformed European Union, and sought to renegotiate on four key points: protection of the single market for non-eurozone countries, reduction of \"red tape\", exempting Britain from \"ever-closer union\", and restricting EU immigration.[45]\nIn December 2015 opinion polls showed a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU, although support would drop if David Cameron did not negotiate adequate safeguards for non-eurozone member states and restriction on benefits for EU citizens.[46]\nThe outcome of the renegotiations was announced in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a country such as the UK would have to get permission from the European Commission and then from the European Council.[47]\nIn a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016, and commented on the renegotiation settlement.[48] He spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a leave vote, and of the \"two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit.\"[49]\nThe official campaign group for leaving the EU was Vote Leave[50] after a contest for the designation with Leave.EU.[51][52]\nThe official campaign to stay in the EU, chaired by Stuart Rose, was known as Britain Stronger in Europe, or informally as Remain. Other campaigns supporting remaining in the EU included Conservatives In,[53] Labour in for Britain,[54] #INtogether (Liberal Democrats),[55] Greens for a Better Europe,[56] Scientists for EU,[57] Environmentalists For Europe,[58] Universities for Europe[59] and Another Europe is Possible.[60]\nThe result was announced on the morning of 24 June: 51.9% voted in favour of leaving the European Union, and 48.1% voted in favour of remaining a member of the European Union.[61][62] Comprehensive results are available from the UK Electoral Commission Referendum Results site. A petition calling for a second referendum attracted more than four million signatures,[63][64] but was rejected by the government on 9 July.[65]\nAfter the result was declared, Cameron announced that he would resign by October.[66] He stood down on 13 July 2016, with Theresa May becoming Prime Minister after a leadership contest. George Osborne was replaced as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Philip Hammond, former Mayor of London Boris Johnson was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and David Davis became Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn lost a vote of confidence among his parliamentary party, and an unsuccessful leadership challenge was launched. On 4 July Nigel Farage announced his resignation as leader of UKIP.[67]\nOutside the UK many Eurosceptic leaders celebrated the result and expected others to follow the UK's example. The right-wing Dutch populist Geert Wilders said that the Netherlands should follow Britain's example and hold a referendum on whether the Netherlands should stay in the European Union.[68] However, opinion polls in the fortnight following the British referendum show that the immediate reaction in the Netherlands and other European countries was a decline in support for Eurosceptic movements.[69]\nMultiple allegations of cyberwarfare and Russian interference in the Brexit referendum, as well as unlawful donations by Saudi Arabia, have been made since the vote.[70]\nAccording to London School of Economics economist Thomas Sampson, \"Older and less-educated voters were more likely to vote \"leave.\"... A majority of white voters wanted to leave, but only 33 percent of Asian voters and 27 percent of black voters chose leave. There was no gender split in the vote, with 52 percent of both men and women voting to leave. Interestingly, although Brexit has never received much backing from liberal or left-wing political leaders, leaving the European Union received support from across the political spectrum... Voting to leave the European Union was strongly associated with holding socially conservative political beliefs, opposing cosmopolitanism, and thinking life in Britain is getting worse rather than better.\"[6]\u00c2\u00a0Econometric studies show \"first, education and, to a lesser extent, age were the strongest demographic predictors of voting behavior... Second, poor economic outcomes at the individual or area level were associated with voting to leave... Third, support for leaving the European Union is strongly associated with self-reported opposition to immigration, but not with exposure to immigration.\"[6]\nThere are allegations that Vote Leave broke electoral law and that the breach influenced the result. Kyle Taylor of Fair Vote Project (which aims to rerun the referendum) stated, \u201clet\u2019s take back control of our democracy The issue is too big to have half the country or more than half the country, wonder \u2018was that actually the result? Is this the future the country wants?\u2019 That\u2019s first and foremost, let\u2019s be certain, everybody play by the rules.\u201d Taylor maintains further, \u201con the basis of fairness, it has to be the same vote posed in the same way\u201d. [71]\nWithdrawal from the European Union is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Under the Article 50 invocation procedure, a member notifies the European Council and there is a negotiation period of up to two years, after which the treaties cease to apply. Although terms of leaving may be agreed,[72] aspects such as trade may be difficult to negotiate until the UK has left the EU.[73]\nAlthough the 2015 Referendum Act did not expressly require Article 50 to be invoked,[74] the UK government stated that it would expect a leave vote to be followed by withdrawal[75][76] despite government refusal to make contingency plans.[77] Following the referendum result, Cameron resigned and said that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50.[78][79]\nThe Supreme Court ruled in the Miller case in January 2017 that the government needed parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50.[80][81] After the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted, on 1 February 2017, for the government's bill authorising the prime minister to invoke Article 50,[82] the bill passed into law as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. Theresa May signed the letter invoking Article 50 on 28 March 2017, which was delivered on 29 March by Tim Barrow, the UK's ambassador to the EU, to European Council President Donald Tusk.[83][84][85]\nIt has been argued that the Article 50 withdrawal process may be halted unilaterally by the British government,[86] with which opinion the author of Article 50 itself, Lord Kerr, has expressed agreement, but the EU Commission disputes this.[87] The European Parliament's Brexit committee has noted that unilateral revocation, regardless of its legality, poses a substantial moral hazard, with EU member states potentially able to abuse it to blackmail the Union.[88]\nBoth parties to the withdrawal negotiation are bound by Article 50 (3), which states explicitly that the EU treaties will cease to apply \"from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after\" the withdrawal notification unless the EU Council and UK agree to extend the two-year period.\nOn the EU side, the EU's Directives for the negotiation of an agreement notes that \"The Agreement should set a withdrawal date which is at the latest 30 March 2019 at 00:00 (Brussels time),\" \u2014i.e. Central European Time\u2014 \"unless the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously decides to extend this period in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union.\"[89]\nOn the British side, originally the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill said that \" 'exit day' means such day as a Minister of the Crown may by regulations appoint\".[90] If no time is specified, it is \"the beginning of that day\".[90] However, after being amended in Committee Stage, the bill now says \" 'exit day' means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m\", and \"A Minister of the Crown may by regulations amend the definition of 'exit day' \".[90]\nThe British and EU negotiators agreed that initial negotiations, relating especially to residency rights, would commence in June 2017 (immediately after the French presidential and parliamentary elections), and full negotiations, relating especially to trading agreements, could commence in October 2017 (immediately after the German federal election, 2017).[91][92][93] The first day of talks was 19 June.[92]\nOn 28 June 2016, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, and on the following day European Council President Tusk, stated that the UK could remain in the European Single Market (ESM) only if the UK accepted its four freedoms of movement: for goods, capital, services, and labour.[94][95] In October, Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised that ending the jurisdiction of EU law and free movement from Europe were the UK's priorities, along with British and EU companies having maximum freedom to trade in the UK and the ESM.[96][97]\nIn November 2016 May proposed that Britain and the other EU countries mutually guarantee the residency rights of the 3.3\u00a0million EU immigrants in Britain and those of the 1.2\u00a0million British citizens living on the Continent, in order to exclude their fates being bargained during Brexit negotiations.[98] Despite initial approval from a majority of EU states, May's proposal was blocked by Tusk and Merkel.[99]\nIn January 2017 the Prime Minister presented 12 negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek permanent single market membership.[100] The European Parliament's lead negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that there could be no \"cherry-picking\" by the UK in the talks.[101]\nThe statutory period for negotiation began on 29 March 2017, when the UK formally submitted a letter notifying withdrawal. The letter called for a \"deep and special relationship\" between the UK and the EU, and warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in EU-UK trade under World Trade Organisation terms, and a weakening of the UK's co-operation in the fight against crime and terrorism. The letter suggested prioritising an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice-versa, and stated that the UK would not seek to remain within the ESM. Instead, the UK would seek a free trade agreement with the EU.[102] In response, Merkel insisted that the EU would not discuss future co-operation without first settling the terms of leaving the EU; Verhofstadt referred to the letter as \"blackmail\" with regard to the point on security and terrorism, and EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK's decision to quit the block was a \"choice they will regret one day\".[103]\nOn 29 April 2017, immediately after the first round of French presidential elections, the EU27 heads of state accepted negotiating guidelines prepared by Tusk.[104] The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, in which the UK first agrees to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, and then negotiations on a future relationship can begin.[105] In the first phase, the EU27 would demand the UK pay a \"divorce bill\", initially estimated as amounting to \u00a352bn[106] and then, after additional financial demands from Germany, France, and Poland, to \u00a392bn.[107] A report of the European Union Committee of the House of Lords published on 4 March 2017 stated that, if there is no post-Brexit deal at the end of the negotiating period, the UK could withdraw without payment.[108]\nOn 22 May 2017, the European Council authorised its negotiators to start the Brexit talks and it adopted its negotiating directives.[109] The first day of talks took place on 19 June, where Davis and Barnier agreed to prioritise the question of residency rights, while Davis conceded that a discussion of the Northern Irish border would have to await future trade agreements.[110]\nOn 22 June 2017, Prime Minister May guaranteed that no EU citizen living legally in the UK would be forced to leave, and offered that any EU citizen living in the UK for more than 5 years until an unspecified deadline between March 2017 and March 2019 would enjoy the same rights as a UK citizen, conditional on the EU providing the same offer to British expatriates living in the EU.[111] The Prime Minister detailed her residency proposals on 26 June, but drew no concessions from EU negotiators,[112] who had declined to expedite agreement on expatriates by the end of June 2017,[113] and who are hoping for European courts to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK with regards to EU citizens, according to their negotiation aims published in May 2017.[114][115]\nThe second round of negotiations began in mid-July 2017. Progress was made on the Northern Irish border question; UK negotiators requested a detailed breakdown of the \"divorce bill\" demand; and the EU negotiators criticised the UK's citizenship rights offer.[116] David Davis did not commit to a net payment by the UK to the EU with regards to the requested divorce bill, while Michel Barnier would not compromise on his demand for the European Court of Justice to have continuing jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit,[117] rejecting the compromise proposal of a new international body made up of British and EU judges.[118]\nOn 16 August 2017, the UK government disclosed the first of several papers detailing British ambitions following Brexit, discussing trade and customs arrangements.[119] On 23 August, Theresa May announced that Britain will leave the EU Court of Justice's direct jurisdiction when the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 ends, but that both the British courts and the EU Court of Justice will also keep \"half an eye\" on each other's rulings afterwards as well.[120] One of the UK government's position papers published in August called for no additional restrictions for goods already on the market in the UK and EU.[121]\nThe third round of negotiations began on 28 August 2017. There was disagreement over the financial settlement; The Irish Times explained that British negotiators referred to the seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF or Maff) for the period 2014-2020 agreed by member states and the EU parliament as a \"planning tool\" for the next period rather than a legally-binding financial obligation on member states. The British case is that the MFF sets ceilings on spending under various headings and is later radically revised during the annual budget process when real legal obligations on each state arises. This contrasts with the EU Commission's methodology for calculating the UK Brexit bill which involves dividing the MFF into the shares historically agreed by each member state.[122] On the Irish border question there was a \"breakthrough\", with the British side guaranteeing free movement of EU citizens within the Common travel area constituting Ireland and the United Kingdom.[123]\nOn 5 September 2017, Davis said that \"concrete progress\" had been made over the summer in areas such as protecting the rights of British expats in the EU to access healthcare and over the future of the Irish border, while significant differences over the \"divorce bill\" remained.[124] On 9 September, the EU Commission published several negotiating papers, including one in which the EU concedes/declares that it is the responsibility of the UK to propose solutions for the post-Brexit Irish border. The paper envisages that a \"unique\" solution would be permissible here; in other words, any such exceptional Irish solution would not necessarily be a template for post-Brexit relationships with the other EU members.[125]\nOn 22 September 2017, May announced further details of her Brexit proposal.[126][127] In addition to offering 20\u00c2\u00a0billion euros over a two-year transition period and continued acceptance of European immigrants,[128] she also offered a \"bold new security relationship\" with the EU which would be \"unprecedented in its depth\" and to continue to make \"an ongoing contribution\" to projects considered greatly to the EU and UK's advantage, such as science and security projects.[127][126] She also confirmed that the UK would not \"stand in the way\" of Juncker's proposals for further EU integration.[127][126] Barnier welcomed May's proposal as \"constructive,\"[129] but that it also \"must be translated into negotiating positions to make meaningful progress\".[129] Similarly, President of France Emmanuel Macron was adamant that the EU would not begin negotiations on future EU-UK relationships until \"the regulation of European citizens, the financial terms of the exit, and the questions of Ireland\" were \"clarified\" by the UK.[130]\nThe fourth round of talks began on 25 September, with Barnier declaring he had no mandate from the EU27 to discuss a transition deal suggested by Prime Minister May. Davis reiterated that the UK could honour commitments made during its EU membership only in the context of a future \"special partnership\" deal with the EU.[131]\nAt the European Council meeting of 19/20 October 2017, the 27 leaders of the EU states were to decide whether or not to start trade negotiations with the UK.[121] However, Davis has conceded that so soon after the German elections on 24 September, a German coalition government may not be in place in time for making this decision in October, delaying any European Council decision until their December meeting.[132][133]\nEU negotiators have stated that an agreement must be reached between Britain and the EU by October 2018 in order to leave time for national parliaments to endorse Brexit.[129]\nOn 9 October 2017, May announced to the British Parliament that Britain could operate as an \"independent trading nation\" after Brexit if no trade deal is reached with the EU.[134]\nIn December 2017, EU leaders announced an agreement to begin the next phase of negotiations, with talks on a transition period after March 2019 to begin in early 2018 and discussions on the future UK-EU relationship, including trade and security, to begin in March.[135]\nIn October 2016, Theresa May promised a \"Great Repeal Bill\", which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in UK law all enactments previously in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, it was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017.[136] The bill will not come into force until the date of exit, and aims to smooth the transition by ensuring that all laws remain in force until specifically repealed.[137] The bill has raised constitutional issues regarding the devolution settlements with the UK nations, particularly in Scotland.[138]\nOn 12 September, the bill passed its first vote and second reading by a margin of 326 votes to 290 votes in the House of Commons.[139]\nA report published in March 2017 by the Institute for Government commented that, in addition to the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, primary and secondary legislation will be needed to cover the gaps in policy areas such as customs, immigration and agriculture.[140] The report also commented that the role of the devolved legislatures was unclear, and could cause problems, and as many as fifteen new additional Brexit Bills may be required, which would involve strict prioritisation and limiting Parliamentary time for in-depth examination of new legislation.[141]\nIn 2016 and 2017, the House of Lords published a series of reports on Brexit-related subjects, including:\nThe Nuclear Safeguards Bill 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c19, relating to withdrawal from Euratom, was presented to Parliament in October 2017 and began its Report Stage in January 2018.[142]\nReplying to questions at a parliamentary committee about Parliament's involvement in voting on the outcome of the negotiations with the EU, the Prime Minister said that \"delivering on the vote of the British people to leave the European Union\" was her priority. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, commented that the government did not want a vote at the beginning of the process, to trigger Article 50, nor a vote at the end.[143]\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) produced reports on the economic impact on 58 industries of Britain leaving the EU. The Labour Party made a freedom of information request for details about the reports, but DExEU said that publishing the information would undermine policy formulation, and that it needed to carry out policymaking in a \"safe space\".[144] Labour then proposed a motion of a rarely-used type known as a \"humble address\" in the Commons on 1 November 2017, calling for the papers to be released; the motion was passed unanimously. The leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, said that there could be some delay while ministers decided how to release the information without prejudicing Brexit negotiations.[145]\nImmigration was cited as the second-most important reason for those voting to Leave. KPMG, based on a survey of 2,000 EU workers in UK, estimates that about a million EU citizens working in the UK, see their future in Britain as over or hanging in the balance.[146]\nA 2017 paper by King's College London economists Giuseppe Forte and Jonathan Portes found that \"while future migration flows will be driven by a number of factors, macroeconomic and otherwise, Brexit and the end of free movement will result in a large fall in immigration from EEA countries to the UK.\"[147] According to a 2016 study by Portes, \"The spectrum of options for UK immigration policy postBrexit remains wide... However, almost any plausible outcome will result in an increase in regulatory burdens on business; a reduction in the flows of both unskilled and skilled workers; and an increase in illegal working. The key question for policymakers will be how to minimise these negative impacts while at the same time addressing domestic political demands for increased control without antagonising our EU partners to the point of prejudicing other key aspects of the negotiations. This will not be an easy task.\"[9] Will Somerville of the Migration Policy Institute wrote that \"Future migration levels are impossible to predict in the absence of policy and economic certainty\", but estimated immediately after the referendum that the UK \"would continue to receive 500,000 or more immigrants (from EU and non-EU countries taken together) per year, with annual net migration around 200,000\".[148]\nThe decline in EEA immigration is likely to have an adverse impact on the British health sector.[149] According to the New York Times, Brexit \"seems certain\" to make it harder and costlier for the N.H.S., which already suffers from chronic understaffing, to recruit nurses, midwives and doctors from the rest of Europe.[149]\nOfficial figures in March 2017 indicated that EU immigration to the UK continued to exceed emigration, but the difference between immigration and emigration (\"net migration\") had fallen to its lowest for three years.[150] The number of EU nurses registering with the NHS fell from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017.[151]\nThere is overwhelming or near-unanimous agreement among economists that leaving the European Union will adversely affect the British economy in the medium- and long-term.[152][153][154][6][155][156][157][158][159][160][161][5][162][excessive citations] Surveys of economists in 2016 showed overwhelming agreement that Brexit would likely reduce the UK's real per-capita income level.[153][154][155] A 2017 survey of the existing academic literature found \"the research literature displays a broad consensus that in the long run Brexit will make the United Kingdom poorer because it will create new barriers to trade, foreign direct investment, and immigration. However, there is substantial uncertainty over how large the effect will be, with plausible estimates of the cost ranging between 1 and 10 percent of the UK's income per capita.\"[6] These estimates differ depending on whether the UK stays in the European Single Market (for instance, by joining the EEA), makes a free trade agreement with the EU, or reverts to the trade rules that govern relations between all World Trade Organization members.[6] In January 2018, the UK government's own Brexit analysis was leaked; it showed that UK economic growth would be stunted by 2%-8% for at least 15 years following secession from the EU, depending on the leave scenario.[163][164]\nMost economists, including the UK Treasury, argue that being in the EU has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK's trade would be worse off if it left the EU.[165][166][167][168] According to a group of University of Cambridge economists, under a \"hard Brexit\" whereby the UK reverts to WTO rules, one-third of UK exports to the EU would be tariff-free, one-quarter would face high trade barriers and other exports risk tariffs in the range of 1-10%.[169] A 2017 study based on data from 2010 found that \"almost all UK regions are systematically more vulnerable to Brexit than regions in any other country. Due to their longstanding trade integration with the UK, Irish regions have levels of Brexit exposure, which are similar to those of the UK regions with the lowest levels of exposure, namely London and northern parts of Scotland. Meanwhile, the other most risk-exposed EU regions are all in southern Germany, with levels of risk which are typically half that of any UK or Irish region, and one third of that displayed by many UK regions. There is also a very noticeable economic geography logic to the levels of exposure with north-western European regions typically being the most exposed to Brexit, while regions in southern and eastern Europe are barely affected at all by Brexit, at least in terms of the trade linkages... Overall, the UK is far more exposed to Brexit risks than the rest of the EU.\"[170]\nAfter the referendum, the Institute for Fiscal Studies published a report funded by the Economic and Social Research Council which warned that Britain would lose up to \u00a370\u00a0billion in reduced economic growth if it did not retain Single Market membership, with new trade deals unable to make up the difference.[171] One of these areas is financial services, which are helped by EU-wide \"passporting\" for financial products, which an Oliver Wyman report for a pro-EU lobby group estimated indirectly accounted for up to 71,000 jobs and \u00a310\u00a0billion of tax annually,[172][not in citation given] and some banks announced plans to relocate some of their operations outside the UK.[173] According to a 2016 article by John Armour, Professor of Law and Finance at Oxford University, \"a 'soft' Brexit, whereby the UK leaves the EU but remains in the single market, would be a lower-risk option for the City than other Brexit options, because it would enable financial services firms to continue to rely on regulatory passporting rights.\"[174]\nA 2017 study found, on the basis of \"plausible, empirically based estimates of the likely impacts on growth and wages using relationships from the existing empirical literature\", that \"Brexit-induced reductions in migration are likely to have a significant negative impact on UK GDP\u00c2\u00a0per capita (and GDP), with marginal positive impacts on wages in the low-skill service sector.\"[175][6] It is unclear how changes in trade and foreign investment will interact with immigration, but these changes are likely to be important.[6]\nFormer Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King commented that warnings of economic doom regarding leaving the EU were overstated and that the UK should leave the single market and probably the customs union in order to gain more opportunities, which would lead to improved British economic performance.[176]\nResearch on the effects that have already materialised in the United Kingdom since the referendum results show that the referendum result pushed up UK inflation by 1.7 percentage points, leading to an annual cost of \u00a3404 for the average British household.[7] Another study on the effects that have already materialised found \"contrary to public perception, by the third quarter of 2017 the economic costs of the Brexit vote are already 1.3% of GDP. The cumulative costs amount to almost 20\u00a0billion pounds and are expected to grow to more than 60\u00a0billion pounds by end-2018.\"[8][177] According to a Financial Times analysis, the Brexit referendum results had by December 2017 reduced national British income by between 0.6% and 1.3%, which amounts to almost \u00a3350\u00a0million a week.[178] University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen noted in August 2017 that some of the adverse effects of uncertainty brought about by the Brexit referendum were being made apparent, as British consumer confidence was down and spending had declined to its lowest level in four years.[179] In November 2017, it was reported that European banks had reduced their UK-related assets by \u20ac350bn in the 12 months after Brexit vote,\u00a0and that the trend was expected to increase ahead of the March 2019 Brexit deadline.[180]\nShort-term macroeconomic forecasts by the Bank of England and other banks of what would happen immediately after the Brexit referendum proved to be too pessimistic.[157][181] The assessments assumed that the referendum results would create greater uncertainty on financial markets and in business and reduce consumer confidence more than it did.[181] According to Oxford University economist Simon Wren-Lewis, \"short term unconditional macroeconomic forecasts are extremely unreliable\" and they are something that academic economists do not do, unlike banks.[182] Wren-Lewis notes that long-term projections of the impact of Brexit, on the other hand, have a strong empirical foundation.[182] University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen wrote that economists \"have had little success at reliably predicting when and why uncertainty arises\"\u00c2\u00a0and that it is unclear how severe the impact of uncertainty actually is.[179] King's College London economist Jonathan Portes said that \"short-term economic forecasting is very unreliable\", and compared short-term economic forecasts to weather forecasts and the long-term economic forecasts to climate forecasts: the methodologies used in long-term forecasts are \"well-established and robust\".[181] Other economists note that central bank forecasts are not intended for pinpoint accuracy.[181] London School of Economics economist Thomas Sampson notes that it is harder to assess the short-term impact that the transition process to Brexit will have, but that long-term assessments of the post-Brexit period are more reliable.[6] According to the Financial Times, economists are in agreement that the short-term effects are uncertain.[157]\nOn 5 January 2017 Andy Haldane, the Chief Economist and the Executive Director of Monetary Analysis and Statistics at the Bank of England, said that the BoE's own forecast predicting an immediate economic downturn due to the referendum result was inaccurate and noted strong market performance immediately after the referendum,[183][184][185] although some have pointed to prices rising faster than wages.[186] Haldane said that the field of economics was \"to some degree in crisis\" because of its failure to predict the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, and added that the Brexit economic forecast was only inaccurate in its near-term assessment, and that over time, the Bank still expected that Brexit would harm economic growth.[184] Imperial College London economist David Miles responded to Haldane, saying that there was no crisis in economics, and that economists did not purport to be able to forecast with full certainty or predict the precise timing of events.[187] Miles said that it was widely acknowledged among economists that short-term forecasts, such as the BoE's, are unreliable.[187]\nBrexit requires relocating the offices and staff of the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority, currently based in London.[188] The agencies together employ more than 1,000 people and will respectively relocate to Amsterdam and Paris.[189] The EU is also considering restricting the clearing of euro-denominated trades to eurozone jurisdictions, which would end London's dominance in this sector.[190]\nAccording to a 2016 study by Ken Mayhew, Emeritus Professor of Education and Economic Performance at Oxford University, Brexit poses the following threats to higher education: \"loss of research funding from EU sources; loss of students from other EU countries; the impact on the ability of the sector to hire academic staff from EU countries; and the impact on the ability of UK students to study abroad.\"[10]\nThe UK received more from the EU for research than it contributed[191] with universities getting just over 10% of their research income from the EU.[192] All funding for net beneficiaries from the EU, including universities, was guaranteed by the government in August 2016.[193] Before the funding announcement, a newspaper investigation reported that some research projects were reluctant to include British researchers due to uncertainties over funding.[194] Currently the UK is part of the European Research Area and the UK is likely to wish to remain an associated member.[195]\nAs suggested by the Scottish Government before the referendum,[196] the First Minister of Scotland announced that officials were planning an independence referendum due to the result of Scotland voting to remain in the European Union when England and Wales voted to leave.[197] In March 2017, the SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon requested a second Scottish independence referendum in 2018 or 2019 (before Britain's formal exit from the EU).[198] The UK Prime Minister immediately rejected the requested timing, but not the referendum itself.[199] The referendum was approved by the Scottish Parliament on 28 March 2017. Sturgeon called for a \"phased return\" of an independent Scotland back to the EU.[200]\nAfter the referendum, First Minister Sturgeon suggested that Scotland might refuse consent for legislation required to leave the EU,[201] though some lawyers argue that Scotland cannot block Brexit.[202]\nOn 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill.[203] This was passed due to stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after exit day from the European Union. This Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. [204] The Bill will gain Royal Assent on 28 April 2018.[205]\nThe Financial Times said that there were approximately 759 international agreements, spanning 168 non-EU countries, that the UK would no longer be a party to upon leaving the EU.[206] This figure does not include World Trade Organisation or United Nations opt-in accords, and excludes \"narrow agreements\", which may also have to be renegotiated.[206]\nThe UK's post-Brexit relationship with the remaining EU members could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament in July 2013 proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access to the EU internal market. These include remaining in the European Economic Area,[207] negotiating deep bilateral agreements on the Swiss model,[207] or exit from the EU without EEA membership or a trade agreement under the WTO Option. There may be an interim deal between the time the UK leaves the EU and when the final relationship comes in force.\nThere is still great uncertainty about Brexit's impact on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, in particular the impact it may have on the economy and people of the island were a \"hard border\" to be put in place.[208] At present (November 2017), both the UK and the Republic of Ireland are members of the EU, and therefore both are in the Customs Union and the Single Market. There is freedom of movement for all EU nationals within the Common Travel Area and there are no customs or fixed immigration controls at the border. Since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement (an international treaty between the UK and Ireland as well as an agreement within Northern Ireland), the border has been essentially invisible. Following Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become a land border between the EU and a non-EU state. It is therefore possible that the border will return to being a \"hard\" one, with fewer, controlled, crossing posts and a customs infrastructure. This would be a return to the position before both states joined the EU with the additional point that, unless the Free Travel Area is maintained, passport checks may also be required. This outcome, or one like it, is referred to as a \"Hard Border\" and both the EU and the UK have agreed this would be a poor outcome to be avoided if possible. Creating a border control system between Ireland and Northern Ireland could jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement.[209][210][211][212]\nWhen in 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, the border between the Free State and Northern Ireland, which chose to remain in the UK, became an international frontier. This event became commonly known as the \"partition of Ireland\". Trade in goods and services across this frontier became subject to differing tax and tariff arrangements. Consequently, an infrastructure of Customs posts was put in place at designated crossing areas. All traffic was subject to inspection by the jurisdiction it was passing in to. This could entail full vehicle searches with consequent delay and inconvenience. However passport checks were not applied. The Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom were part of the Common Travel Area. This allowed travel between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain, without passport controls. The Isle of Man and the Channel Isles are also part of the area. This arrangement came into existence in 1922 with the establishment of the Irish Free State and so predated the freedom of travel provisions consequent on membership of the EU, which to some degree superseded it. In 2011, the British and Irish Governments agreed informally to continue their common controls on entry to the CTA [for non-EEA nationals].[213] According to statements by Theresa May and Enda Kenny, it is intended to maintain this arrangement after the United Kingdom leaves the EU.[214] After Brexit, in order to control migration by EU citizens (other than Irish nationals) across the open Northern Irish land border into the United Kingdom, the UK and Irish governments suggested in October 2016 an outline plan entailing British immigration controls being applied to Irish ports and airports. This would avoid passport checks being required between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.[215] However, this agreement was never finalised and was met by opposition from political parties in the Republic of Ireland,[216] On 23 March 2017, it was confirmed that British immigration officials would not be allowed to use Irish ports and airports in order to combat British immigration concerns following Brexit.[217]\nA referendum for the reunification of Ireland was suggested by Sinn F\u00e9in leader Martin McGuinness immediately after the UK EU referendum results were announced.[218] In April 2017 the European Council agreed that, in the event of Irish reunification, Northern Ireland would rejoin the EU.[219]\nThe President of the Regional Council of Hauts-de-France, Xavier Bertrand, stated in February 2016 that \"If Britain leaves Europe, right away the border will leave Calais and go to Dover. We will not continue to guard the border for Britain if it's no longer in the European Union,\" indicating that the juxtaposed controls would end with a leave vote. French Finance Minister Emmanuel Macron also suggested the agreement would be \"threatened\" by a leave vote.[220] These claims have been disputed, as the Le Touquet 2003 treaty enabling juxtaposed controls was not an EU treaty, and would not be legally void upon leaving.[221]\nAfter the Brexit vote, Xavier Bertrand asked Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to renegotiate the Touquet agreement,[222] which can be terminated by either party with two years' notice.[223] Hollande rejected the suggestion, and said: \"Calling into question the Touquet deal on the pretext that Britain has voted for Brexit and will have to start negotiations to leave the Union doesn't make sense.\" Bernard Cazeneuve, the French Interior Minister, confirmed there would be \"no changes to the accord\". He said: \"The border at Calais is closed and will remain so.\"[224]\nGibraltar is outside the European Union's common customs area and common commercial policy and so has a customs border with Spain. Nevertheless, the territory remains within the European Union until Brexit is complete.\nDuring the campaign leading up to the referendum[225] the Chief Minister of Gibraltar warned that Brexit posed a threat to Gibraltar's safety.[226] Gibraltar overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU. After the result Spain's Foreign Minister renewed calls for joint Spanish\u2013British control of the peninsula.[227] These calls were strongly rebuffed by Gibraltar's Chief Minister[228] and questions were raised over the future of free-flowing traffic at the Gibraltar\u2013Spain border.[229] The UK government states it will only negotiate on the sovereignty of Gibraltar with the consent of its people,[230] but Spain, like each of the EU members, effectively has veto power over the Brexit agreement.\nIn February 2018, Sir Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's Minister for Enterprise, Training, Employment and Health and Safety (and former Chief Minister) expressed frustration at the EU's attitude, suggesting that Spain was being offered a veto, adding \"It's enough to convert me from a supporter of the European Union into a Brexiteer\".[231]\nBrexit has also created a resurgence in academic and political advocacy for negotiating trade and migration agreements with the \"CANZUK\" countries - those of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.[232][233] This has been echoed by multiple politicians in the four countries, including Liberal Senator, James Paterson in Australia,[234] Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Erin O'Toole in Canada[235] and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson in the United Kingdom.[236] Organisations such as CANZUK International have also championed the movement,[237] stating that relationships between the four countries will flourish after Brexit.[238] However, numerous academics have criticised this alternative for EU membership as \"post-imperial nostalgia\".[239][240]\nShortly after the referendum, the German parliament published an analysis on the consequences of a Brexit on the EU and specifically on the economic and political situation of Germany.[241] According to this, Britain is, after the United States and France, the third-most important export market for German products. In total Germany exports goods and services to Britain worth about \u20ac120\u00a0billion annually, which is about 8% of German exports, with Germany achieving a trade surplus with Britain worth \u20ac36.3\u00a0billion (2014). Should there be a \"hard Brexit\", exports would be subject to WTO customs and tariffs. The trade weighted average tariff is 2.4%, but the tariff on automobiles, for instance, is 9.7%, so trade in automobiles would be particularly affected; this would also affect German automobile manufacturers with production plants in the United Kingdom. In total, 750,000 jobs in Germany depend upon export to Britain, while on the British side about three million jobs depend on export to the EU. The study emphasises however that the predictions on the economic effects of a Brexit are subject to significant uncertainty.\nAccording to the Lisbon Treaty (2009), Council of the EU decisions made by qualified majority voting can only be blocked if at least four members of the Council form a blocking minority. This rule was originally developed to prevent the three most populous members (Germany, France, Britain) from dominating the Council of the EU.[242] However, after a Brexit of the economically liberal British, the Germans and like-minded northern European countries (the Irish, Dutch, Scandinavians and Baltic states) would lose an ally and therefore also their blocking minority.[243] Without this blocking minority, other EU states could overrule Germany and its allies in questions of EU budget discipline or the recruitment of German banks to guarantee deposits in troubled southern European banks.[244]\nWith Brexit, the EU would lose its second-largest economy, the country with the third-largest population and \"the financial capital of the world\", as the German newspaper M\u00fcnchner Merkur put it.[245] Furthermore, the EU would lose its second-largest net contributor to the EU budget (2015: Germany \u20ac14.3\u00a0billion, United Kingdom \u20ac11.5\u00a0billion, France \u20ac5.5\u00a0billion).[246]\nThus, the departure of Britain would result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors, unless the budget is reduced accordingly: Germany, for example, would have to pay an additional \u20ac4.5 billion for 2019 and again for 2020; in addition, the UK would no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, in which only EU members can participate. Britain's share amounts to 16%, \u20ac39.2\u00a0billion (2013), which Britain would withdraw unless there is an EU treaty change.[247]\nThe departure of the UK is expected to have a major effect on the EU. In many policy votes Britain had allied with the relatively more economically liberal Germany who together with other northern EU allies had a blocking minority of 35% in the Council of the European Union. The exit of the UK from the European Union means that this blocking minority can no longer be assembled leading to speculation that it could enable the other EU countries to enforce specific proposals such as relaxing EU budget discipline or providing EU-wide deposit guarantees within the banking union.[248][244]\nUK MEPs are expected to retain full rights to participate in the European Parliament up to the Article 50 deadline. However, there have been discussions about excluding UK MEPs from key committee positions.[249]\nThe EU will need to decide on the revised apportionment of seats in the European Parliament in time for the next European Parliament election, expected to be held in June 2019, when the United Kingdom's 73 MEPs will have vacated their seats. In April 2017, a group of European lawmakers discussed what should be done about the vacated seats. One plan, supported by Gianni Pittella and Emmanuel Macron, is to replace the 73 seats with a pan-European constituency list; other options which were considered include dropping the British seats without replacement, and reassigning some or all of the existing seats from other countries to reduce inequality of representation.[250][251]\nThe UK's exit from the European Union will leave the Republic of Ireland and Cyprus as the only two remaining common law jurisdictions in the EU. Paul Gallagher, a former Attorney General of Ireland, has suggested this will isolate those countries and deprive them of a powerful partner that shared a common interest in ensuring that EU legislation was not drafted or interpreted in a way that would be contrary to the principles of the common law.[252] Lucinda Creighton, a former Irish government minister for legal affairs, has said that Ireland relies on the \"bureaucratic capacity of the UK\" to understand, influence and implement EU legislation.[253]\nThe combined EU fishing fleets land about 6 million tonnes of fish per year,[254] of which about 3 million tonnes are from UK waters.[255] The UK's share of the overall EU fishing catch is only 750,000 tonnes (830,000 tons).[256] This proportion is determined by the London Fisheries Convention of 1964 and by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy. The UK government announced in July 2017 that it would end the 1964 convention in 2019. Loss of access to UK waters will particularly affect the Irish fishing industry which obtains a third of its catch there.[257] The Common Fisheries Policy gives access for any member country to the waters of any other member country. The policy is generally considered a disadvantage to fish-rich countries and is a major reason why Norway and Iceland are not members. The European Economic Area treaty gives access to the inner market but does not include fishing.\nQuestions have arisen over how existing international arrangements with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms should evolve. Some countries\u00a0\u2013 such as Australia and the United States\u00a0\u2013 wish to challenge the basis for division (i.e., division between the UK and the continuing EU) of the trade schedules previously agreed between them and the EU, because it reduces their flexibility.[258]\nAs of 2018[update], the WTO does not have any protocols covering trade in services.\nVarious EU leaders said that they would not start any negotiation before the UK formally invokes Article 50. Jean-Claude Juncker ordered all members of the EU Commission not to engage in any kind of contact with UK parties regarding Brexit.[259] In October 2016, he stated that he was agitated that the British had not developed a sense of community with Europeans during 40 years of membership; Juncker denied that Brexit was a warning for the EU, envisaged developing an EU defence policy without the British after Brexit, and rejected a suggestion that the EU should negotiate in such a way that Britain would be able to hold a second referendum.[260] On 5 November 2016, Juncker reacted to reports of some European businesses seeking to make agreements with the UK government, and warned: \"I am telling them [companies] that they should not interfere in the debate, as they will find that I will block their path.\"[261] Juncker stated in February 2017 that the UK would be expected to pay outstanding commitments to EU projects and pensions as part of the withdrawal process, suggesting such bills would be \"very hefty.\"[262]\nGerman foreign secretary Frank-Walter Steinmeier met Britain's foreign secretary Boris Johnson on 4 November 2016; Johnson stressed the importance of British-German relationships, whereas Steinmeier responded that the German view was that the UK should have voted to stay in the EU and that the German priority now was to preserve the remaining union of 27 members. There could be no negotiations before the UK formally gives notice. A long delay before beginning negotiations would be detrimental. Britain could not keep the advantages of the single market but at the same time cancel the \"less pleasant rules\".[263]\nNewly appointed prime minister Theresa May made clear that negotiations with the EU required a \"UK-wide approach\". On 15 July 2016, she said: \"I have already said that I won't be triggering article 50 until I think that we have a UK approach and objectives for negotiations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think it is important that we establish that before we trigger article 50.\"[264]\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph, the Department for Exiting the European Union spent over \u00c2\u00a3250,000 on legal advice from top Government lawyers in two months, and had plans to recruit more people. Nick Clegg said the figures showed the Civil Service was unprepared for the very complex negotiations ahead.[265]\nIn the wake of the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union, the Department for International Trade (DIT) for striking and extending trade agreements between the UK and non-EU states was created by Prime Minister Theresa May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016.[266] It employs about 200 trade negotiators[267] and is overseen by the Secretary of State for International Trade, currently Liam Fox.\nOn 17 January 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May, announced a series of 12 negotiating objectives in a speech at Lancaster House. These consist of an end to European Court of Justice jurisdiction, withdrawal from the single market with a \"comprehensive free-trade agreement\" replacing this, a new customs agreement excluding the common external tariff and common commercial policy, an end to free movement of people, co-operation in crime and terrorism, collaboration in areas of science and technology, engagement with devolved administrations, maintaining the Common Travel Area with Ireland, and preserving existing workers' rights.[268]\nThe Government has stated its intention to \"secure the specific interests of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as those of all parts of England\". Through the Joint Ministerial Committee on EU Negotiations (JMC(EN)), the Government intends to involve the views of the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly in the process of negotiating the UK's exit from the EU. For instance, at the January 2017 meeting of the JMC(EN), the Scottish Government's proposal to remain in the European Economic Area was considered.[269]\nEU negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's chief negotiator has said that: \"All British citizens today have also EU citizenship. That means a number of things: the possibility to participate in the European elections, the freedom of travel without problem inside the union. We need to have an arrangement in which this arrangement can continue for those citizens who on an individual basis are requesting it.\" The suggestion being an \u201cassociate citizenship\u201d.[270]\nAn EU meeting to discuss Brexit has been called for 29 April, Donald Tusk stating that the \"priority would be giving \"clarity\" to EU residents, business and member states about the talks ahead\". Michel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit, has called for talks to be completed by October 2018 to give time for any agreement to be ratified before the UK leaves in March 2019.[271]\nSinn F\u00e9in has called for a referendum to create a united Ireland, following the Northern Ireland majority decision (56% to 44%) to vote no to Brexit and 2 March election to the Northern Ireland Assembly wherein Sinn F\u00e9in increased its number of seats.[272]\nIn early May, Jean-Claude Juncker said that the UK leaving the EU was a \"tragedy\" and that it is partly the responsibility of the EU. \"The EU, in many respects has done too much, especially the Commission\", including \"too much regulation and too many interferences in the lives of our fellow citizens\". The European Commission has, following the \"Better regulation\" initiative, in place since before Brexit, reduced the number of legislative proposals from 130 to 23 per year.[273][274]\nFollowing the EU referendum, there have been several opinion polls on the question of whether the UK was \"right\" or \"wrong\" to vote to leave the EU. The results of these polls are shown in the table below.\nThere have also been opinion polls on the question of how people would vote in a second referendum on the same question. The results of these polls are shown in the table below.\nIn July 2017, LSE/Opinium research indicated that 60% of Britons wanted to retain EU citizenship after Brexit.[288]\nRex Tillerson, former United States Secretary of State, considers that the European Union and the United Kingdom should perform a fast Brexit to avoid useless disagreement.[289]\nThe response of artists and writers to Brexit has in general been negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain's creative industries voting against leaving the European Union.[290]\nResponses by visual artists to Brexit include a mural, painted in May 2017, by the secretive graffiti artist Banksy near the ferry port at Dover in southern England. It shows a workman using a chisel to chip off one of the stars on the European Union Flag.[291]\nIn his 2017 art exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London, the artist Grayson Perry showed a series of ceramic, tapestry and other works of art dealing with the divisions in Britain during the Brexit campaign and in its aftermath. This included two large ceramic pots, Perry called his Brexit Vases, standing on plinths ten feet apart, on the first of which were scenes involving pro-European British citizens, and on the second scenes involving anti-European British citizens. These were derived from what Perry called his \"Brexit tour of Britain.\"[292]\nOne of the first novels to engage with a post-Brexit Britain was Rabbitman by Michael Paraskos (published 9 March 2017). Rabbitman is a dark comic fantasy in which the events that lead to the election of a right-wing populist American president, who happens also to be a rabbit, and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, were the result of a series of Faustian pacts with the Devil. As a result, Rabbitman is set partly in a post-Brexit Britain in which society has collapsed and people are dependent on European Union food aid.[293]\nMark Billingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Love Like Blood (published 1 June 2017) is a crime thriller in which Brexit sees a rise in xenophobic hate crime.[294] In the novel The Remains of the Way (published 6 June 2017), David Boyle imagines Brexit was a conspiracy led by a forgotten government quango, still working away in Whitehall, originally set up by Thomas Cromwell in the sixteenth century during the reign of King Henry VIII, and now dedicated to a Protestant Brexit.[295]\nPost-Brexit Britain is also the setting for Amanda Craig's The Lie of the Land (published 13 June 2017), a satirical novel set ten years after the vote to leave the European Union, in which an impoverished middle class couple from Islington in north London are forced to move from the heart of the pro-European Union capital, to the heart of the pro-Brexit countryside in Devon.[296]\nBrexit is also the baseline for Douglas Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comic political thriller Time of Lies (published 23 June 2017). In this novel, the first post-Brexit general election in 2020 is won by a violent right-wing former football hooligan called Bob Grant. Board charts the response to this of the hitherto pro-European Union metropolitan political elite.[297]\nStanley Johnson's Kompromat (scheduled for July 2017) is a political thriller that suggests the vote to leave the European Union was a result of Russian influence on the referendum, although Johnson has insisted his book is not intended to point the finger at Russia's secret services, but is \"just meant to be fun.\"[298]\nIn June 2017, the National Theatre in London presented a play by Carol Ann Duffy, entitled My Country; a work in progress. An allegorical work, the play uses the device of a convention called by the goddess Britannia, who is concerned about the future of the British people.[299] The play differs from some artistic responses in that Duffy and the National Theatre-based the attitudes of the characters in part on the responses of ordinary people in interviews that were conducted by the regional offices of the UK Arts Councils, but excluding responses from London and the south-east of England, where most people voted not to leave the EU. As a result, according to Dominic Cavendish, writing in The Daily Telegraph, \"the bias is towards the Leave camp\".[300]\nFollowing the Brexit vote, there have been several attempts to set up a new pro-European political party.[301][302] Examples include 'The Democrats' (a proposal by former Daily Mail political editor James Chapman), 'The Radicals' (proposed by Jeremy Cliffe, former Berlin bureau chief of The Economist) and the Renew Britain party.[302]\nIn 2017, newly elected Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable criticised 'pop up' anti-Brexit parties formed following the 2016 referendum, saying of those groups policies \"...it is the kind of ideology-free, technocratic, authoritarian centrism that would be more at home in, say, Singapore.\" and \"Voters beware.\"[303]",

        "text": "Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance-disaster film directed, written, co-produced and co-edited by James Cameron. A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios, at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200\u00c2\u00a0million.\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved critical and commercial success. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nIn 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.\nAware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.\nCal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the master-at-arms' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\nAfter braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia[7] but Rose is saved.\nWith Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. She later finds out Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the 1929 Wall Street crash.\nBack in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean \u2014 in her possession all along \u2014 and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed,[8] photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanic's Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died.\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[22] the film includes portrayals of several historical figures:\nSeveral crew members of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh appear in the film, including Anatoly Sagalevich, creator and pilot of the MIR self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[40] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the Titanic Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[41][42]\nJames Cameron had a fascination with shipwrecks, and, for him, the RMS Titanic was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.\"[44][45][46] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. So when an IMAX film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself, he decided to seek Hollywood funding to \"pay for an expedition and do the same thing.\" It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[44]\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a Titanic film,[47] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic\".[45][46] Cameron stated, \"They were like, 'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets, shoot-outs, or car chases?' I said, 'No, no, no. It's not like that.'\"[10] The studio was dubious about the idea's commercial prospects, but, hoping for a long-term relationship with Cameron, they gave him a greenlight.[10][11][20]\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck itself,[47] and organized several dives to the site over a period of two years.[43] \"My pitch on that had to be a little more detailed,\" said Cameron. \"So I said, 'Look, we've got to do this whole opening where they're exploring the Titanic and they find the diamond, so we're going to have all these shots of the ship.\" Cameron stated, \"Now, we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[45] The crew shot at the real wreck in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995 and actually spent more time with the ship than its passengers. At that depth, with a water pressure of 6,000 pounds per square inch, \"one small flaw in the vessel's superstructure would mean instant death for all on board.\" Not only were the dives high-risk, but adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high quality footage that he wanted.[11] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with Titanic's hull, damaging both sub and ship and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of Captain Smith's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior. The area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was also damaged.[48]\nDescending to the actual site made both Cameron and crew want \"to live up to that level of reality.... But there was another level of reaction coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama,\" he said. \"It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" Cameron stated, \"You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one \u2013 maybe a documentarian.\" Due to this, he felt \"a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it \u2013 to do that part of it right, too\".[20]\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[47] He wanted to honor the people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanic's crew and passengers.[43] \"I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life,\" he said.[45] \"And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it.\"[45] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californian's role in Titanic's demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship that night. \"I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially if we were going to dive to the ship,\" he said. \"That set the bar higher in a way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[45]\nCameron felt the Titanic sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[43] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy,[40] while the blossoming romance of Jack and Rose, Cameron believed, would be the most engaging part of the story: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[43] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in Titanic I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[20]\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[43] While Winslet and Stuart stated their belief that, instead of being asleep in her bed, the character dies at the end of the film,[49][50] Cameron said that he would rather not reveal what he intended with the ending because \"[t]he answer has to be something you supply personally; individually.\"[8]\nHarland and Wolff, the RMS Titanic's builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[51] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. Towering above was a 162-foot-tall (49\u00a0m) tower crane on 600 feet (180\u00a0m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[40]\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic's builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's' original designs.[52] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[53] Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.[11]\nPrincipal photography for Titanic began in July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the filming of the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh.[40] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed.[40] The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[54] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[55] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[54] Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[56]\nA full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[11] Despite this, several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film, not least involving the two main stars.[57][58]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression.[10] \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[20] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.[20]\nOther times on the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[59] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[59] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[59] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds,\" he said.[59] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelt backwards).[59] In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[59]\nDuring the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh shoot in Canada, an angry crew member put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[10][60] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including actor Bill Paxton.[60] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[10] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[10][59] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[49][61]\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[61] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[61] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[62] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\nI'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[61]\nThe costs of filming Titanic eventually began to mount and finally reached $200\u00c2\u00a0million, [3][4][5] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[63] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[10] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[10]\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"...the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than T2 and True Lies. Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[20]\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted Digital Domain to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Many previous films about the RMS Titanic shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[64] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14\u00a0m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[65] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20\u00a0m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[64] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS Jeremiah O'Brien's engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[66] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[67] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[68]\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000\u00a0L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000\u00a0L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227\u00a0m) exterior of the RMS Titanic had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[40] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000\u00a0L) tank,[69] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[51]\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous Titanic films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[11] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls\".[11]\nThere was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the SS Californian was close to the Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"[20]\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the Titanic's sinking.[70]\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it.[71] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the \"Heart of the Ocean\" if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[71]\nThe soundtrack album for Titanic was composed by James Horner. For the vocals heard throughout the film, subsequently described by Earle Hitchner of The Wall Street Journal as \"evocative\", Horner chose Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album Innerst i sjelen, and he particularly liked how she sang \"Eg veit i himmerik ei borg\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He had tried twenty-five or thirty singers before he finally chose Sissel as the voice to create specific moods within the film.[72]\nHorner additionally wrote the song \"My Heart Will Go On\" in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs with singing in the film.[73] C\u00e9line Dion agreed to record a demo with the persuasion of her husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[73] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[11]\n20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures co-financed Titanic, with Paramount handling the North American distribution and Fox handling the international release. They expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997. The film was to be released on this date \"in order to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[11] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film for summer would not be possible.[11] With production delays, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[74] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[11]\nThe film premiered on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[75][76] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by The New York Times.[77] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[11]\nIncluding revenue from the 2012 and 2017 reissues, Titanic earned $659.4 million in North America and $1.528 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.187 billion.[6] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, and remained so for twelve years, until Avatar (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[78] On March 1, 1998,[79] it became the first film to earn more than $1\u00a0billion worldwide[80] and on the weekend April 13\u201315, 2012\u2014a century after the original vessel's foundering, Titanic became the second film to cross the $2\u00a0billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[81] Box Office Mojo estimates that Titanic is the fifth highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[82] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[83]\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of the eighteenth James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies. By New Year's Day, Titanic had made over $120\u00c2\u00a0million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. Its highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[84][85] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[86] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998 with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188.[87] Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[88] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[89]\nBefore Titanic's release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially due to it being the most expensive film ever made at the time.[59][90][91][92] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\" since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[91] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[59] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[59]\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[90] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[91] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20\u00a0million a week for ten weeks,[93] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million a week.[91] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen Titanic twice by its fifth week.[94] Although young women who saw the film several times, and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\", were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[95] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[93][96]\nThe film's impact on men has also been especially credited.[97][98][99] Now considered one of the films that \"make men cry\",[97][98] MSNBC's Ian Hodder stated that men admire Jack's sense of adventure, stowing away on a steamship bound for America. \"We cheer as he courts a girl who was out of his league. We admire how he suggests nude modeling as an excuse to get naked. So when [the tragic ending happens], an uncontrollable flood of tears sinks our composure,\" he said.[97] Titanic's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film Zombieland, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since Titanic.\"[100]\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during Titanic and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[98]\nScott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[99]\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. Titanic's catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[101][102] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[102]\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how Titanic worked.\"[103] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for Titanic was over 20%.\"[11] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[11]\nTitanic held the record for box office gross for twelve years.[104] Cameron's follow-up film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[105][106] and did so in 2010.[78] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of Titanic's haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [tracked] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[107] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic's revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[105] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord.\"[93] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar's performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[106]\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing Titanic's success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s\u00a0\u2013 awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[108]\nTitanic garnered mainly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical and political impacts.[108][109][110] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 178 reviews, with a rating average of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[96] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating to reviews, the film has a score of 74 based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorably reviews\".[111] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service to earn the score.[112]\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[113] He named it his ninth best film of 1997.[114] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[115] James Berardinelli stated, \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it.\"[116] It was named his second best film of 1997.[117] Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[118] Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, \"To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[119]\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said, \"You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[120] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as, \"A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[119] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that \"Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind.\"[119] Richard Corliss of Time magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[121]\nSome reviewers felt that the story and dialogue were weak,[110] while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\",[122] and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[123] Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[124] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[125] In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered\".[126]\nTitanic suffered backlash in addition to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[127] and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time\".[128] The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[129] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[130] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[92]\nCameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular. \"Titanic is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off,\" he stated. \"They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliche,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[131]\nEmpire eventually reinstated its original five star rating of the film, commenting, \"It should be no surprise then that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's Titanic at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[132] In 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[133]\nTitanic began its awards sweep starting with the Golden Globes, winning four, namely Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[134] Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were also nominees.[135] It won the ACE \"Eddie\" Award, ASC Award, Art Directors Guild Award, Cinema Audio Society Awards, Screen Actors Guild Award (Best Supporting Actress for Gloria Stuart), The Directors Guild of America Award, and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award (Best Director for James Cameron), and The Producer Guild of America Award.[136] It was also nominated for ten BAFTA awards, including Best Film and Best Director; it failed to win any.[136]\nThe film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve[137] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the Titanic to win that award, after 1933's Cavalcade), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[136][138] Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart and the make-up artists were the three nominees that did not win. James Cameron's original screenplay and Leonardo DiCaprio were not nominees.[90] It was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after Ben-Hur.[136] The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King would also match this record in 2004.\nTitanic won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as three Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television.[136][139][140] The film's soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, and became a worldwide success, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[141] The soundtrack also became the best-selling album of 1998 in the U.S.[142] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. The film also won Best Male Performance for Leonardo DiCaprio and Best Movie at the MTV Movie Awards, Best Film at the People's Choice Awards, and Favorite Movie at the 1998 Kids' Choice Awards.[136] It won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[136] Titanic eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[136] Additionally, the book about the making of the film was at the top of The New York Times' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[11]\nSince its release, Titanic has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 series. So far, it has ranked on the following six lists:\nTitanic was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS and laserdisc on September 1, 1998.[148] The VHS was also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. A DVD version was released on August 31, 1999 in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[149] At the time, fewer than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original Titanic DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[149]\nTitanic was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005 when a three-disc Special Collector's Edition was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, as well as various special features. The two-disc edition was marketed as the Special Edition, and featured the first two discs of the three-disc set, only PAL-enabled. A four-disc edition, marketed as the Deluxe Collector's Edition, was also released on November 7, 2005. Available only in the United Kingdom, a limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title Deluxe Limited Edition, was released with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary Ghosts of the Abyss, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of Ghosts of the Abyss, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[92]\nTitanic was released on Blu-ray as a single disc variant and a 2 disc version featuring special features on September 10, 2012.[150] A 4 Disc Blu-ray 3D version was released the same day.[151][152] A limited Collector's Edition box set including the Blu-ray 3D, 2D Blu-ray, DVD, a digital copy and a variety of souvenirs was also released exclusively to Amazon.com and other international retailers.[153]\nWith regard to television broadcasts, the film airs occasionally across the United States on networks such as TNT.[154] To permit the scene where Jack draws the nude portrait of Rose to be shown on network and specialty cable channels, in addition to minor cuts, the sheer, see-through robe worn by Winslet was digitally painted black. Turner Classic Movies also began to show the film, specifically during the days leading up to the 82nd Academy Awards.[155]\nA 2012 re-release, also known as Titanic in 3D,[156] was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18\u00c2\u00a0million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[157] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D[158] and Sony with Slam Content's Panther Records remastering the soundtrack.[159] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[160] For the 3D release, Cameron opened up the Super 35 film and expanded the image of the film into a new aspect ratio, from 2:35:1 to 1:78:1, allowing the viewer to see more image on the top and bottom of the screen.[161] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea, on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the scene for showing an unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send film director Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[162]\nThe 3D version of Titanic premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[163][164] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days shy of the centenary of RMS Titanic embarking on her maiden voyage.[165][166][167]\nRolling Stone film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3.5 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies Titanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[168] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[169] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[170] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She further added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[171]\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7\u00a0million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3\u00a0million over the weekend, finishing in third place.[172][173] Outside North America it earned $35.2\u00a0million finishing second,[174] and improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9\u00a0million.[175] China has proven to be its most successful territory where it earned $11.6\u00a0million on its opening day,[176] going on to earn a record-breaking $67\u00a0million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[175] The reissue ultimately earned $343.4\u00a0million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8\u00a0million from Canada and United States.[177]\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[178][179][180]\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, Titanic was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[181]\nTitanic Live was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[182] In April 2015, Titanic Live premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[183] The Express said it was \"An absolute triumph, Titanic Live brought the film to life in a beautiful new way.\"[184]",
